    To properly view the world, you have to recognize that it is on a global scale. And thus conflict and or depravity will be exhibited within that total realm. The very fact that we have an economy, means that the pace of our life will move towards and draw from markets. And by that, as all conflict is based on preservation, so will the shortcomings of that propell some to take what others have. 
    <br>&emsp;By this, I cannot say I know what is right and wrong. For I don't submitt to much more than these mere happenings. And of those purer causes, so is it but a drip of time to mend things out. And indeed, all negative conception can be blunted by this sense. For even in moments of severity, ought this be shouldered by calmer moments leading in, and simpler moments following. "And we ought not accept the fallacy of thinking that this natural process of things is but a surrounding to an otherwise eradict event; rather, it too proceeds with common cause." 
    <br>&emsp;In many ways, our core philosophy is that nothing occurs but through the annals of time. And generally all that occurs well, comes from inventions of sort; by which all can transition to use such advents, and propell the status of things to newer highs. But conflict and misfortune take time to accrue, and at that, are as equally swift in their progress. 
    <br>&emsp;From this, we are left with the odd remark, in that, if we are free enough to see the annals ahead, then ought we sink into such liberty and provide the products born from that. Or ought we scower the land around, and see whether or not there are those worse off than us. "Those who are sat un less even grounds us; as remarks perhaps the time, the culture, lineage even. For we may be so well off because of our particular circumstance; rather than that which is provided to all by the general times and ways: some may not have so readily caught up."
    <br>&emsp;Indeed, are furried threat is that of suggestion, and our vulernability from not being so progressively applied. Indeed, I don't feel that those who provoke such feelings do so with the aim of me being a rebel. In fact, I think they'd like me to see the way things are, as to contribute towards a lasting change. Regardless of the strenght in what they say, and whether it illuminates issues as I'd see, so are we comparable in aim, to wit, we both care for the propserity  of people; and by that token, the development past tradition.
    <br>&emsp;Our problem perhaps is that we don't live in a pasturized state, as to worry only about what is fair and relevant. Even if there were a war, and bombs were dropped, so wouldn't I know outside of a superficual degree. This indeed is a dear admission. For much of my contention with those who prompt such thinness, do so only to the effect of our fear of something happening at all. And all too much of our sense bears the weight of reproaching from the belief that something will happen at all. "It would be better to accept that it can, but that, of reality, ought the bones of that be as strong as our conceptions would benefit." Indeed, this is quite tough, for reason says that little of which is true is actually known. And so in our less than applied ways, we are no less ignorant or short of principle. Nevertheless, upon hearing words of reason, or the babblings of this and other, so is our 'senility' within our particular freedom tampered with. And we are left with this underlying fear that things are not as we'd mind. "Perhaps the world is not so large, and our mature view is not representative." 
    <br>&emsp;Hereby our friction stands, to the effect, that of our balance between inputs which unsettle, so lies the counter of a sturdy understanding; wherein we are not simply with reproach, and humbly at ease outside of being provoked, but rather clear on things, and with a grip on them as our deeper sentiments reflect. To the effect that the complexion of our reproach is not merely a lauded haze, but a solid iron of which the obscurity of the world is known. "And not even the clearest debree of tradition or pundancy could penetrate that."
    <br>&emsp;Where I stand then is in a sort of memory. As if, in a ruffled stated, we recalled how the burning grief present in our mind was in fact not laudible, nor comparable to our past experience of a deep and tranquil mind. By that, I'd state that the mind is but an electrical response, with a mere obscurity to distribution. By that, lies the contention of being: but to us, nothing special lies. At any rate, even if we lived in a war torn country, the service required of us would be one of sacrifice; to which our triumph was in courage, rather than overcoming defeat. "Herein lies the hunting grounds for chimera's of pain of monstrosity." 
    <br>&emsp;No matter, the fact remains that the world is relativley modern. And that, of those which we deem other, so are they so but in a novel way, rather than of the distinct sort in which our past relations reflected. We are all human; and despite the holes in our conduct, so is their a common union of aims and values; by which, in whole or parts, we share, support, and at the very  least accept, the shared goal of love and prosperity. From this, I give much aceeptence to the fact that less a medely of nuclear bombs are dropped, that the world will persist. The effects of the climate, however progressed or developed, will be but novelly poor. "As our times are such, that the very matter of annihilation is a mark of us being civilized enough as not to seek that, that so would our lasting process into a warming world, see a resourcefull attempt to mitigate that: and at the very least treat its effects. To which we say, the result is but a degree of prominent perril." Robots sit 100 miles off of any reasonable regard; and surely, find themselves being seen with a even mind and confident eye.

    So this may be a fools errand, as I have an interest in forming our selves, as not to be so impressionable during our rest or idle periods. I recognize though that during those moments, I will still be subject to said impressions. But my thought, is that by strengthening our views of things, as not to be so hazy  or orbiting around, that their clearness and nearness will bear me a natural posture; and thus a normal insolubility to sorbib sights.
    <br>&emsp;As it were, we are trying to learn of the world. Depth is one thing, but breadth is what I seek. Some things have a natural pairing with histroy, in population namely; or that of illness and death. But the reality is, that our efforts are pointed towards denominations and their resepctive proportions within a part of life. The rate of malaria in Africa, the suicide rate in Asia, the prevalance of aids in Europe, or the homicide rate in South America. 
    <br>&emsp;That being said, it is important to note the weight we put on certain strata. For the earth as a whole is in reality a set of continents, and they nations. These however, are each split into regions, states, terriotries/holds, cities and districts --Eastside of NewYork compared to the Bronx. For our efforts, it makes sense to have a solid view of the larger pieces, and then specialzie in certain smaller parts. We may learn about the whole of Nigeria, the whole of China's southern region, the whole of Ontario, the whole of Miami, the whole of Compton. We will never know the whole of all these pieces. There is just too much. But we can find strenght at lower depth, comparable to what we have near the surface. 
    <br>&emsp;At that, I'd describe our broader efforts as one which balance between continents and countries. For the matters of Asia are one thing, but those of India and China seem most prevalent. In that sense, Canada, the US and Mexico are a fair western batch, as is Brazil, Argentina and Urugay perhaps; along with Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa another; and Britain, Germany and France as the big European three.

<div id="LittleWorld">
    So it feels like we should be ourselves; but in that, be somewhat seperate, if not distinct, from our mother and father. 
    <br>&emsp;It would seem preferable that we'd all co-exist. But if there isn't a shared view of things, or taste for what not, then the seriousness of this may lead to distance yourself. For I will always be near, if not around. But our actual invovlement, if beyond family matters, is spent together, is up for question.
    <br>&emsp;For my parents view the news. And idneed, without our own sect of ingestion, we are left a little thwarted by the very prescence of this; as if said source is something soul and entire, 'as in the governances of fables: to which the protaganist ignores'. 
    <br>&emsp;In the comparison of church, there are many, and of varied divisions and orders; kinds even. By seeing that our parents view one line of things, so are we less grieved by the impression of such thing, 'for it is merely one of many means of impression'. 
    <br>&emsp;What I find though, is that I feel a little bare when we are so disposed to our view of things; if we are humouring this varied mix. But if I simply be, and not worry so much about our identity, then the prescence of the news becomes consuming. For it is not so that it is special in its impressions; rather, that by our cirucmstance, we are privy to it: for our parents watch it often through the day. 
    <br>&emsp;I will state for the record, that our animosity is akin to a disturbance of peace. A state of which may not rightly be so; but no so for we lack which the disturbanced is in the form of; but rather our somewhat private and or unoccupied means of peace. In that, our identity is such as to receive less impression, as we are sold to another. But in this, we are less receptive to our family and fortune: for like impressions, we keep things out. And so I feel more confident, and longing, for a scenario which is faciliative to that: likely by our own means, rather than the generoisity of our parents.
    <br>&emsp;It may simply be so, that our parents are inclined to watch the news. They may have very well been more mdoern, and watched podcasts, or been more delierate, and watched nothing at all. "At least, whatever they did watch, they were aware of it, and noted as such."
    <br>&emsp;The trouble is that I cannot say anything. For it is essentially peverting our state in the family; nor, if we then moved out, or provided for ourself, would we so deeply care: or be privy to such disturbances. 
    <br>&emsp;The reality though, is we are not asked to contend with what they see or feel regarding the news. Nor do we have to humour their fascination, or respect for those invovled. Words of the kind have never come up.
    <br>&emsp;Where were left then, is in this comparable spot to one we've been in before; whereby we sit, a little uneased, but in a space which ought be alotgether full of it: for we are given all, and asked for not: yet still remain unfine, or at least susceptible to intrusion. Our little world is what's provided. But this get's tampered with from media and tv. 
    <br>&emsp;I guess my resovle ought be, as reflects our encouragment to learn what we are otherwise in defense of, as contrasts those impressions which we deny, what it is we ought to do, or can do and would like, with respect to what we know. Which is in all, to say, that perhaps ideally their would be a different form to our gradual approach, in that the strenghts and weaknesses of it would be natural. But in this case, even if the weaknesses exposed are akin to that which gets shown upon vile consumption, that so may we attest to the thing discovered. And considering the principle defect shown, or insight gained, so may our resolve be equally based. "In that, upon learning who we truly are, may we amend to something truly worth doing: and how we deliberaytley be."So it feels like we should be ourselves; but in that, be somewhat seperate, if not distinct, from our mother and father.

<div id="MereInquiry">
    So I am not a solider, nor will I be one. I accept the conflict that others may find with those around them; but I am all too happy to accept any ones rule. Much aggression has occured due to self-defense. But personally, there is nothing I hold dear which can be taken from me: as all good is already mine. Indeed, one may coherce me to do something. But nothing which goes against what I already do. "I am not defending a belief agasint another, as I have none already."
    <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is in the unclaimed land of inquiry. Around this lies the smoldering flame of legend: namely, that of other peoples view of things.
    <br>&emsp;For there may be a war, and it may appear as if all are fixated on this. But there is, in reality, a grand assortment of people whos minds are somewhere else. Nor, is any event, so special when compared to the millions around. The world will simply move on.
    <br>&emsp;I cannot always see this though. Indeed, my aversion to particular sources is that they flatten my view of things, and make bank of knowledge squishy. But the truth, is that without the sensibility which remarks what I have known, then so will I become engrained to the fixated sense: where I then fear and believe, that of a conflict there is exclusively so; and of others views, so are they but nearer to the soul thing of importance. 
    <br>&emsp;My life then is odd. For the base of it comes down to our ignorance of tradition, and an otherwise state within a path uncompramised. From here, we've simply asked questions. Perhaps out of this dynamic, whereby we are left with nothing but which we have. And our family is perhaps so acceptably present, that there habits and views become enclosed around me, 'as that smoldering flame'. I never seem to escape this. In fact, those early days of self-embrace, and the cause of that, come from a similar process, in that our parents were not listened to: and so we found our other way. For having none felt hopeless and not. 
    <br>&emsp;Where I have come to grow, is in the constance of this state, even if I was smoldered; and from there, drawn to restless rebuke, or rot relief. But I carried on; in some ways addressing the principle nature of this way, whereby I curried myself as not to be so vulnerable. But I never found anything else, in realtionships, meaning or friends. And so, the lingering heart of our mom and dad was so, that our shortcomings were immediately subject to their prescence. "One of which is moulded in sharp contrast to mine." Indeed, this state of constance has shown me, that of it polished shine, that this need not be sequestered, or imperfect. We may simply choose as to reflect the cheer in that way; and perhaps be invested and ordained enough, as not to notice the heat from those, who'd melt you when you've lost your own flame

<div id="RotEvent">
    So I have some feelings that are causing me grief. There's no problem, but my view of certain things feel unknown, and so I thought by merely sharing this, my aprpehension would cease.
    <br>&emsp;So I am writing this, not becuase there's some problem to be solved or thing to be changed Rather, I just have some feelings, and hiding them is causing me to feel contentious, but not warrentedly. So I thought that sharing them would remedy this.
    <br>&emsp;First, I do not like the news. It does not speak to me, nor does it reflect how I see the world, and by that, how I desire and fear things. I simply don't identify with it. It is not a resource which I admire, or find pleasure engaging with. I've felt this way for a long time, and it is the key example of a feeling which makes something into a problem, only because it is unheard. Nothing need change. I just wanted you to know.
    <br>&emsp;///Ever since I moved up to Kamloops, and to this day, I have felt off because of this, as every morning and night, the news is on one of our tvs. To me, my ignorance is not measuredd by whether I watch the news or not. The world is larger and more mundane than anything it provokes. Which is indeed my biggest grievence with it, that it provokes me, to feel sympathy and frustration. I find no pleasure in this, and in my personal time, I avoid such things --in terms of my time and youtube etc.//// I am not asking anything to change. But as I said, not sharing my feeling leads to unfair judgement and resentment, and I'd rather it be known how I feel, then be full of irritation and scorn. I simply don't care for it.
    <br>&emsp;Secondly, is the course of my life. To squash this pretense that 'my oddities are an inhibitor to things', I would say, conversely, that my lack of friends, career and romance are not so because I've made myself uneligble. It's simply because of the choices I made. Prior to leaving Vancouver, I was well sat at work, in friends and potential romance. I don't expect that this cannot return. In term's of work, I see the promise (as mom suggested) in getting a certifacte in IT. I cannot say this is my prferred job though, as it would surely be from home, and right now, I care more to be around people, and work on my feet. It is a good option, and there are much more like it, but it is not in my current sights. It is something I can progress towards, and develop my baser means of income, but when I think of what I'd really like to do, for interests sake, I'd like to make a TikTok channel, making little quotes and phrases made from my writing. It has to be a buisness though, as the consistency required cannot be approached casually, nor without preperation.
    <br>&emsp;Neither of these mean that the other can't be pursued, but they'll each find their time.
    <br>&emsp;I feel drawn to do this, but I'm being realistic about how much it takes, and what I'm willing to do right now. I don't see this interfering with more standard work, but one is but a development past working basic labor, while the other is about something I'd truly care for. Each will find their time.
    <br>&emsp;Thirdly, is chidlren. Say what you will of my life, where it's lacking, where it could be, but I contend, that the only thing I have to anwser to, in terms of some requirment in life ahead, is children. I can say, that naturally, I'll have one. I say this happily, and with understanding of what it needs. Having given this some thought prior, I can say that I'd only want 1. That, and I see myself doing so when I am ready to make it my primary happiness and responsability. Currently, theres an abudnacne of things I otherwise care for, and am driven towards. So beyond my means to having a kid, I don't have much desire for one, now at least. And as for a relationship which would precede this, I have no fear or worry about that. My oddities, upon thought, are not any concenr, or something I can't adjust. 
    <br>&emsp;All in all, my only cares are to write, read and study, play games, watch youtube, be healthy and relish the outdoors. This is satisfactory on my own; and I can surely invovle more people in this. Even if there are none who I connect with on said basis, there are still other things I can do to be more social, or balance out my life elsewhere. These cares of mine feed off my ability to engage with them, which is the reason I care about being healthy: as the more I am, the more I can thrown myself in. And the moral of my life has been, that these things need not be sacrificed in order to pursue/have other things. You merely add to them.
    <br>&emsp;Those are my feelings, such is my way. If I can live accordinfly, than I am happy to be home, and benefit by it.
    <br>&emsp;--to even out the rest of my life. 
    <br>&emsp;These are my dearest cares. When I am unhealthy and flattened by junk, they feel far away. I ought not be so frugal for the sake of these, at the expense of friends and all other things. But considering that those can be fit into my life, so am I unapolegtic for being as good as my happiness from those other things can beenfit from.

<div id="SoKeen">
    So I question whether our view of things is as solid as we believe. For one, we are not in the scenarios which appear to us on tv. Nor does it truly represent what it is like to be there. Indeed, we can imagine what it is like, but therein lies the issue. Whereas reading impresses you calmy and fully, I find that visual inputs are saturating, and blend little with what I already know, with any conserved proportions. And indeed, my deepest aversion to such mediums is how they distort my sizeable view of the world, and instead mix it all up, to where it feels chaotic and small. "As if those suffering were right over there; or threats upon me, were right at my door." This runs against the scope of the world. And indeed, despite the loose depiction which we get; or at the very least a simplified view, as if we take for granted that everything visual encapsulates all the many happenings around, so are we left far abroad, likely fortunate, be it of the country were in, or our particlar home. And from there, it seems that we are not but interested, in awe, and perhaps gripped by the narrative of it all: in how bad some have it, and how bad some produce. This is but a glancing contribution though; and I would say, that it is not those so keen to watch from abroad which hold the key to aid, but those in the communities near the incident. This is a deep mark against visual formatts, for they glimmer so brightly at us, that we sometimes forget that what their showing us is a world away; and that many governments and peoples lie between us and that. Is our passive interest during the 6:00 news really helping? I would say, that there are ways to help. But these seem almost eclusivley relevant to direct action, rather than our mere emotional invovlement. Of that I am unsure, for none of it seems to center around anything other than education. There may be other avenues, but they seem centered on spreading senitment; which, albeit suspect for shallow grounds, still appeals to the heart of the matter, and in an outstanding way. There is surely room for both. If your not doing that though, then I don't feel like your earning anything more than a coloring of your worldview, and by that, a tipped balance of your own life and propserity. By all accounts, a view of the world which holds history and breadth in regard, is not likely drawn to matters of those entire continents away. Our actions are quite unoticible to those a province over; or a town even. I scorn not at those who shout with sentiment, or try and educate those about the matter. But those recieving ought do so with propiety, 'as not to be moulded by headlines and glamour'. Were looking for education, not wonder. 
    <br>&emsp;I guess my point, is that if your not going to produce anything meaningfull, then why feed off of those who do so, but in a way that is unfitting for a truly deep and enrichened view? Learning is of interest beyond conquest; but of that, your liberty lies. And why, in all your freedom, to be merely keen, would you settle? Personally, I see the visual format as more accessible, and the programming nature to be excitable. "I am so frustrated though, because I angle my interests differently, towards an end which actually treats my care to know things, not what is merely appealing. Such things, as I've found, are akin to fast-food, in that they are filling, but not in a wholesome or abundant way." 
</div>
<div id="RoughParadise">
    So mom and dad, and surely Jess, are not out to get you. They demand very little of you. But they indeed, do not hunour, or at least aid, our natural happiness; nor the form it takes.
    <br>&emsp;We are unsure of things, necessarily, but via circumstance too. We do not know about work, about living here, what our harmony with that means for the future. And life's mystery avails us here too. Generally, this centers on the chimeras of violence and revolt, but also our positive decree, of uniformity and fecundity. We know not where this road goes, nor if the bumps were filling are from the ground or uneven shoes. 
    <br>&emsp;I feel like a stranger in my own home. No one has the faintest idea of what cheer and flourishing great activity brings; and how nutered this is from poor choices; or a lack of good ones. Their surprise and sketicism is not appreciated. As if anything they did was understood on some basic level, besides a norm; yet, I am only ever asked the most unfamiliar question, 'as if eating Broccoli or working out was a good thing....like how?'.
    <br>&emsp;Those shoes of ours show themselves, almost clearly when under pressure, how unset they are, and the road, whihc, from our sight and prior view, is not so bumpy in character. Yet, it is rough, and demanding of attention; and apt to bring wear and control: as all pursuits and itineraries do. Our uncertainty of which part of the path we'll take,and the evdient preview of this, to which our feet have not hit earth and steadied forth, explains our current wear. 
</div>
<div id="OurAge">
    So, prior to leaving Kamloops, we were in a solid routine, generally. We were exercising, not eating sugar, our sleep was well. Comapred to now, we were not running, nor doing much recovery. Our workouots were not too consistent, though we were fairly constant in our free range. 
    <br>&emsp;As we've moved though, and aided Jessica in here move, we've lost a great deal of momentum. To the point, where our workouts are either absent, or done forecfully, to a fairly negative degree. The perril is in our hips, in that we sit too narrow while trying to be upright, and this causes a lordosis in our mid back; to which our shoulders come together, but in a shrug. This is killing our neck. Normally it does not, but we have no fair means to do pushups, or squats even; and so we beckon at the effect of not working out, or push through that poor posture. 
    <br>&emsp;In principle, we should do what is right for now. Despite recognizing our lack, we still are best to do things well. I think, foremost, we could diversify our stable motions. This does not mean we'd practice, but akin to a forward fold, simply do more movements in a common way. Low lunge side twist plus quad stretch has been a great advent of this. There is room to do more volume when it comes to lifts, and perhaps warrior, but when it comes to leg raise, bridge, squating, ought we do it as if  it were some indispenisible stretch. Include it with a forward fold, or arm raise, and you'll be more open through the day. For now, we ought return to our strenght, and let the running we've done sink in, all while the retain our mould through stability, and our common poses.
    <br>&emsp;Food wise were best to eat a fair amount. It is required that you wake up early. No more waking up past 9. If your alarm isn't working, get a new one. It derails us to wake up so late. Our veggies, orange, dried fruit and milk are perfect for the first half of our day. Indeed, I am not so clear or directed as to what our evening should be, or where and how it should be transitioned too. It is indeed a result of our ineptitude as regards money. For we might be best to get corn, edamame, tuna, and otherwise lean on quinoa, as opposed to potatoes, rice and bread. These are not always welcomed. I would not forget, that much of your weightloss comes from not eating enough, rather than eating fully, but to ineffective degree.
    <br>&emsp;We need seeds, oranges, soft bread, quinoa and milk, along with dried fruit.
</div>
<div id="OddEnds">
    The matter of positive and negative regard defines our life. For whichever reason, we are left somewhat elated, at the postive prospect of being at home, freely employed and rightly so, and thereby with our family, propped for the sun and her darling scene; nor the lackings of food, equipment and fun. We can live here, just as we may live elsewhere.
    <br>&emsp;The negativity though comes from some sort of reason; as if something is pressuring you, an ailment as it were. And indeed, much of our strife comes from the frustration that others dimiss said issues. Though, it is perhaps we who are ill-sighted, and have far too long been in such a decrepid state. Indeed, life fits is with such trauma, and naturally, so are we but responding to the ticks and tacks gotten along the way. This is for us to enlighten our soul though: for upon near reflection, we are not in fact so drug, but rather set to be, merrily, proper, and good as so.

<div id="Ordinarily">
    The reality of my life is that little is required. Even this anxious pretense of children is not ripe for trouble, as frugal living levels out all needs.
    <br>&emsp;My querry though is along the lines of positivity, and what this is afforded by. For I do see that stability is needed, so that we may live and rest securely. But in that, is there any quality which one place is damned to lack? I do see varied complexions and nodes of interaction, but all in all, each place is the same. We work, live, rest, and around that, invest, learn, connect and grow. If we can do this well in one home, we can in another. And even if certain grooves are found only in certain spots, so does this not change the steadyness of our hand: or the rocky bounds that each spot holds.
    <br>&emsp;By that, I am remissed to say that more work may be required, if only because any one offer demands at least that much. This is a nice predicament; as we may verily be in a compramised spot, where ease is found through shortcuts. In any case, I do expect that our demands will lighten, in volume surely. In quality, so may the times not prevail. But so is there promise around. 
    <br>&emsp;Where I struggle is in coming up with reaons to be, as if we would be free. For I do not imagine that our baser conditions will detach. Though, I can't say there's any grievence about this, as little of what I'd consider natrually required is either contrary or run down by our demands. It is moreso about the ration of work and living: and seeing that of what I might expect, that theres more of the former than I'd prefer, or desire. 
    <br>&emsp;It just seems like the color of the morn, the grazing of literature and the world, or the mere cheer of gaming and fun, is enough for me to at least be ordinarly, but in a flourishing manner. Of our broader purpose and place, I cannot say. But these things are not at heart to do with horiztonal growth, towards presumed goods abound. We are still left with the balance of work and living. Our intent though, or meaning, may not come about but through our pleasant pace and peace, to which I am happy to find.  
    <br>&emsp;It's just not very clear what to do. For the past and her wares has me somewhat beholden,'like mud on my shirt', to the sentiments and or edges of our time. This is holding less interest in me, nor much reason upon reflection. For instance, the difference of location is not so special, for all places are almost equally esteemed in the good they offer. "Ten pounds of chocolate or vanilla still makes for a heap of ice-cream." Furthermore, the time of year is holding less of that bookended chain. For the winters hold a bare complexion, but vibrance too. Nor is the fresh air something to be averse to. Moreover, there is not much thought in me that says, 'we only mean to be somewhere for a short while, so we must go where we wish within a certain time, otherwise we'll miss the sweetspot of it'. This simply isn't so. There's no need to be anywhere but where you are: where time has brought you, and for all things good, you have formed yourself to be. Change may occur, but frett not. Our time allows for all, nor ought we remark much but the good we see: rather than the wish for more. And at any rate, the reality of all future concern, is to do with things of a broader sort. And indeed, I may only see a hill of riches infront; and by our admittedly uneven grounds, may not see much further. But life will have moved on and caught up upon reaching said point: to where our measure of good is more, and beyond. And as we said, in terms of things far and about, so will this come into clarity and interest by our flourishing way. "And that is about the best one could hope for."

<div id="LightRoad">
    So when you work, you sacrifice your living. For if we did not have to work, the sun would at least draw us. Indeed, this proposition is perhaps flawed, as the requisite that we eat and sleep assigns us a neccessary mean to achieve such. So we'd properly say, that given food and a place to rest, so would we not have to work. We may lack the common means for fun, but so may we gaze at the world and delight. 
    <br>&emsp;The point being that, for the fact that such things are provided, and the good which we'd recieve if they were, means that something is given up for the sake of said provision. And indeed this seems the fashion the course for employment; in that, the work required is not so much a negative, but rather an intrusion to positivity. "For indeed, the actual return of such work comes into qeustion: for if I got twice as much, I would at least have more good to purchase. While those who earn little, have little but their needs met, and not much more: making the obligation a chore, rather than a happy mean."
    <br>&emsp;Conversenly, to state the terms, being given such provision removes your ability to see ahead, or be so free in your strides. For dependance holds no sure end, even if it were a dreaded one. Nor, in the case of family, where judgement is given, is rest easy to achieve: for you are not saxrifcing anything, and thus deserving of a break. But as such, as the worth of dependance is in the abscence of work, that so are you not happy without using your free time for such. Indeed, this is not hard to do, despite the insecurity of how long you may do so. But sustaining this is hard when rest is hard to sink into: as your free time is not esteemed as work, despite the effort invovled. Balance is thus hard to achieve, consistently -without ware. 
    <br>&emsp;In this way, I see that our life is full of positivity, and the minor amount of worked required to be stable, will not cause much interference. In fact, despite the volume of our time being spent on said work, there is the benefit from the actual work, in that it is not as concentrated as your creative efforts. Plus, it is usually around other people. Beyond the balance of exchange, there still lies the preferred lock on your contuinuity. For it is better to earn a bit less, but increase your stock, then to have alot, but whither it away. "For the end is one of loss." As it were, the benefit here is one that magnifies all other goods; and over time, leverages itself into fuller forms, as to increase the magnitude of our living.

<div id="SteadySights">
    So I'm thinking that if were going to stay here, that we work at Superstore. It is close, and this melds with an unbridled view of being here. There's no room for pretense. We may consider our future, as regards buisness, contribution or rearing. But so is this in need of clarity, and as such, living well produces thus. So we need not be anywhere particular for said times to come in line. Besides that, we are merely swell and pure: and this need not bank on any one localle: and can grow and adapt as well in all spots, present or to come.
    <br>&emsp;In that way, I see a similar prospect in East or West walmart. I feel there is more room to negotiate, and so surely, we can achieve that marbled 2 day per week routine. Perhaps, an arrangment of shorter shifts. 
    <br>&emsp;Let's say though that none of the three are hiring. We may choose to leave, be asked to, or stay for the nearer prospects ahead, or something freerer and indefinite.
    <br>&emsp;What I would proclaim, is that living unstabiliy holds a blurred view of the future; as you cannot remark upon it with clear desire or ability. As such, you settle into the gradual paces of your day, or idealize some broader end --as to carry you out. The struggle in this, is that living so gradually wobbles at the intolerance of doing so; and so rest becomes a parched resource: as you may live fully and truly, as you are both composed and definite in your striding state: but so upon the need for rest, do you crumble and despair: yielding an all to common ware. 
    <br>&emsp;Compared to this, the benefit of work, or stability rather, is that you are secure in your means and your further direction. This brings with it the balance of labor and liberty: but so does such things have their own principle measures. At any rate, the advantage of being so set, is not itself a divine privalage, or one of scorching neccessity. It is perhaps right, but not exlusivley. Our gradual ways, which is to say those which are less ideal or worn, but more ripe and solid instead, do produce such future remarks. Indeed, they are not hoistered by the sentiments which stability brings, and therefore lack as much focus or actionable regard: but they do linger between the bounds of this, and by that, hold much concerns for farther ideals, and those comparable but of a nearer sort.

<div id="OffBalance">
    Lifes broader remarks draw me to both hopefully and fairly anend. It is near obvious to me that our care for the former comes from feelings and or regards born from our distant self:  whereby the natural unease and shiftness bring with it aims and concerns correspondant to it. While our stronger sides, which writing tends to bring out, hold more solid bounties. Though, without the promises of our mind, there may not be something so definite to attend. The honest remark then, is that of that which prodds at us now, ought we reflect and attend to this, in and of it self. For it is one thing to be balanced, but unsure of life's greater ways. And another to be so unbalanced, but by such uneveness amend. 
    <br>&emsp;Where I am left then is with the solem remark that our public aims are neither ill sought, but not so steady, in origin or interest. "It is our duty to ourselves though, to be stable enough, as our near efforts and choices are concerned, to be set and ready to see things, and of them, renark. For we are left otherwise bowing ourselves to false imagery and concepts: all bridled by the illusions dangled by the future. And, as said, learning about yourself and the world, and properly tieing the two together as to, in the extent that you are so broadly concerned, amend, is so, that being as to cultivate and harvest such sense, holds the line of right, as to do with you."

    So if I get this job, I will still be in the same lane of life as I would be if I don't. 
    <br>&emsp;If such lane requires I go elsewhere, then so I'll amend. And like this job, in that job I'll acquaint myself with the circumstances, as to bear any weight, and through habit iron it out; and otherwise make use of the good on offer, be it the actual task, or of some advantage it spurrs. And we may trust in ourselves and the affability of men, to improve the circumstanc themselves. For they may get worse indeed. But so mcuh as our care is concerned, and we elect as such, so do we hold the caunch in terms of being simple and frugal. "At this point I fear more being asked than I need: which is a nice position."

<div id="ForProgress">
    The world is a remarkable place. Indeed our judgements come to pass, when we see all the variety of elements: and the according sense that in that, lies so much bad.
    <br>&emsp;But we not ought start here though. As we are more than likely ignorant of all the proportions and sides of most matters; and along with that, subject more to impulse and prejudice, rather than clear thinking. 
    <br>&emsp;Because of this, I'd state that the world ought be known in total, but upon a sensible approach guilded with propiety and reproach. For it is one thing to try and fail, or have no where to go upon admitting what you don't know; and another to be two steps ahead of where you have any right to be, or to be so concluded, and or deprived, as not to even begin.
    <br>&emsp;To begin, we must assert fundementals. For all attempts to define and know end up in models, whereby the elements and motion of things get catalogued into various assortments of systems and terms. The weakness here is that we loose the esscence of the very things which were trying to concieve. For it is one thing to define matter, and by that, assign some indeluble sentiment of being --by which said matter is apart of. But such a sentiment ought not hold its own indefinable esteem. "For we may error in attribution to the thing defined, by something which, in all fairness, is used as if also defined, but not actually so." Moreover, we must also consider whether such sentiments are not themselves inseperable from the subjects which we concieve. For how else can we prescribe the being of an object, and not fall prey to the  identity fallacy: whereby the object in question, in being, is held to be so by some indefinable sentiment of being: but how is an object which cannot be but besides such sentiment of being, be so, if it is not of some sort already? "The infinite infinite."
    <br>&emsp;I must admitt our approach is short of any credulity, and by that, merrit in bowing to. But I can say that with fair observation and solid sense, we can erode the brittle neccessities of the past, and more amply prop up the point where theory and questioning begins. 
    <br>&emsp;I might start here, but in an all to bumbling way; or maybe there, but in a way that even I'm not clear on. So we'll simply say, as Socrates similarly held, that all investigative matters begin with terms. For we need to know what were talking about in order to ask questions, and notably progress. Herein though lies the conflict. For the greatrest mystery's of our day are how anything is at all, be it life, physics, the mind. And, admittedly, this has been the focal point of past inquiries as well. It is those rugged neccessities though, whereby little of the past's claims were built on not but a few esteemed observations; and, as one who in fact knows little cuts corners to fill in the holes, so were these deepest questions solved with a brevity that could match the ultimate emptiness of such claims. For the world is indeed a mystery. And even upon our modern observations, 'so the depths further go'. The issue, is that the phenomena needing an explantion are not so different. And by the granduer of such mysteries, so do the awnser need equal breadth. Only, what we know of the world, on the whole and as pertains to said mysteries, is so much contemporaily, that our suppostions need not fill in but the meagerest wholese; in comparison that is to the gapeing casms of which the past held. For in those times, physics was not naturally understood, nor biology, or geology, or chemistry to any moderate degree. And undernstandibly, as we do in our current day, suppositions were made, as to what could explain the world as we deemed it. And I hold no begrudgement over those whose according suppositions were so comapratively innacurate, as they knew so little. I think, all in all, it makes sense, and ougbt not be surprising. It's the reverence though, or credulity, of either myth or tradition, and its cementing  of such views, which holds our target of scrutiny. For it is one thing to know little of the world, yet still ask, and by that, come up with deranged anwsers. Empedocles suggested that the earth was made of fire and wind, and indeed, this is a wrong view. But it attempts at least; and beyond that, actually holds with it some fair sentiment, namely in the elemental divesity which things seemingly full are made of.  Democritus took this even further, claiming something akin to our own atomic view of the world. The innacuracy ought not be admitted, or heralded, but we can at least respec the inquiry, and by that, sensibility which folded the pieces in an respectable way: even if the pieces were made of dirt and clay. 
</div>
<div id="IllDeemed">
    So the issue in all this is one of progress. For if we start with our observations, as to even know what were explaining, and with some privalage, extend this notion of our senses, as if we are only aware of them by within the domain of observation, then we can say, that progressively, that all our explanations ought so far oblige, as to align with the observations so far.
    <br>&emsp;Indeed, there is the matter of which observations are accepted; moreose, what observations are actually so, and not premises built from unchecked or absent observation: and conclusions at that. "Hereby, the line of modern and old concepts lie."
    <br>&emsp;We might say there are many reasons to remain sketpical, if not inquisitive. For it may be all too easy to say, 'this thing which I fully see and am impressed by, cannot be explained but for this reason: even if this means there is something neccessary, or in other words, 'ethereal'.' Yet, if we establish a fair measure of observation, we may either refute such claim, as to its appeal to inplausibility that something coulnd not be the explanation: for it may not be so neccessary. Or, and this is modernitites further growning claim, that the thing you claim to see, is in fact not so as you identify. And so yes, the planets may need the Gods to orbit them, for based on their motions --which may all be fairly assessed-- that so could nothing but a divine mover do so. But the baser truth, is that planets are nothing but dense dust, born from the even denser bits of a star ---itself a clump within a stellar cloud. And indeed, the true explanation for these is not known, and perhaps in that, God's hand lie. "But we may fairly refute those who say that such hand is guiding an apparent thing, when in fact, there is nothing truly of the sort being guided."
</div>
<div id="FutileLord">
    As a man, I an a bit of a fraud. As I spend too much of my time dreaming, or fortifying myself against issues not there. Too little do I commit myself to anything wortwhile, at least soemthing which matters. Indeed, my dreams center on such topics, but the aim I see is not so as reflects the things which propiate the worth; nor is my intent, and by that lasting stride, made with much care for the obejcts of such worth, but rather of my own. "I dream of saving the world, showing them the way, but all because I am idle, and pleased upon being king, rather than making use of it."
    <br>&emsp;In this our life is mixed and astray. As beyond our  common paces and their sprouting state, we are not with any greater amends: be it to children, community, our selves even. 
    <br>&emsp;Literaily, I spend much time, as writing is a way that brings more life outside of our idel state. Amd do, as a weight against our younger years, does it humble and station our lofty imagination.
    <br>&emsp;Where I am always left is in trying to define the peace upon death, and thereby contempt to the fears and fretting marbling its traditional esteem. Seeing life this way, brings much irrevence for things of a novel sort, and orients you towards more rich and generous things: be it for your own heart and toil, or of people. 
    <br>&emsp;Where I come to pass though, is that there is a complex of pedantry and obscurity. With no ill intent or wicked minds to be fair, but rather a simply  an appeal of the past and a lack of honesty as to what best serves our understanding now. God sits here, like a 800 year old porch chair, ricketing, and by that bearing sounds which warrant his claim; yet when you sit on it, the wood and bolts begin to split and crack. "And weirdly, everyone, more or less, has their own view of this chair, and as it were, fight one another to sit in their own view, and in the process defimate those of others. But all because of this fear of death, and the derived concepts of benevolence by those who (in a baser way) soothe such fear." 
    <br>&emsp;It's just hard to imagine economies and governments functioning properly, even under the load of the gritted past, when those invovleve are not equally human. "As such matters are enlivened through social action: but for the requisite communication and invovlement to occur, ought each member be clear of the other. And as is all to common, burn anyone who is not up to par, or congenial rather for the system, and root them out. 'My purity is bound by the arrangements of me and my fellow brethren: such a formation bears us the stability and riches to thrive. But for the sake of such form, ought we both propietous in our personal conduct, as to warrant our place within, but along with that mend any shortcomings of those who do not meet such standard, and in effect weigh the system down'. Such a sentiment is fair, as rats, all be animals with no evil to sport, ought still be treated as vermin, if it is a matter of people succumbing to filth and disease. Root em out. 'Who are the rats though? Who would not fit in, and by that, earn our collective warrant, as to be equitable into our scale for who we preserve for? Who would not be eligble to rid evil for the sake of? Who would not merrit a place amongst those who merely care to survive?'. Indeed, the rats have more clarity as a threat, then seemingly comparable people."
</div>
<div id="OfWorth">
    It seems a good place to begin, in that we'd mention that the worth of any remark is in that it means something; and generally, this is so, when the quality of our experience is in question. For we may see the ripest of fruits, but out of hands reach: and so we convene to bridge the gap. Or we may be suffering wounds or famine, and by that, work to overcome the pain and depravity. Our souls even, as often treated, are but aspects of us which draw their own concern. Collectively even, our place amidst the whole may bear our amends: as we tailor our point amidst all others. 
    <br>&emsp;For it's usefullness, I tend to work from the sentiment of positivity, which says that, in all things, they move and grow as remarks there orientation within those stated regards: that as mechanics have made them, or their mind and heart whist them to be, so are they moved and sent. Satisfaction compares slightly with comfort, as does inflammation compare with grueling pain. Each are but practical experiences within that natural course, 'whereby the base of things produces ostensibly varied forms of good and bad'. 
    <br>&emsp;To begin then, I'd state that logic is but a behavorial addition to our otherwise living state. As fdr how we think and concieve, and cohoerently, is one thing. But the exhibition of ourselves, be it as we laudily proclaim, or through impulse, is what matters. It is true, that perhaps coming to sight of real knowledge is the greatest thing; but so may we be off in how we see such end, as being so right; for we may in fact be so far off of actually being, at least in the adjoining part of us which is unsubject to such concieving ---ie. our bodies; and as such, so may the end which we seek in terms of knowledge, be entirely unfounded, 'as one's who are elsewhere alive to hoist up our conception --less those may think without a head---may not in fact be so sound in such concpetion, when their living matters are stilted'. 
    <br>&emsp;I submitt that this raises the issue of the mind's ambiguity, and whether or not it is of the body, be it together, or of some comparable sort. For if it is, then we are merely left with a generally accepted whole of bodies, which together, as bodies, are equally subject to the inquiry of how bodies are at all. If the mind is not so comaprable, though it would be hard for one to identify what it is then, as to then denote what is not in fact a body, then the realms of our inquiry which relate the basis of bodies, may itself be what our mind springs from, but in an extended way, rather than force ---for which natural mechanics are contrived from. That, or there may be seperate non-body realms; or better yet, the realm which the mind is associated with, and a associately derived realm by which the bodies are based on. "The sheathe of matter resting upon, or perhaps entirely foregin, to the sheathe of the mind."
</div>
<div id="Positivley">
    The basis for all inquiry is in whether or not any matter of concern can be deemed positivley, or if there is to some extent, a need to suppose. Indeed, there would be reason for all things if we could describe them so postively. While the belief that there is some neccessity, and by that, contrivance, is more in line with oughts. One may say that of that which houses the whole of things, so would it be a certain way. Beyond the weakness of the encumbant lack of positivity, so is there a) no greater positivity when it comes to such neccessary matters, and b) a sort of faintness to any absolute assertion regarding  locig, so far is it pertains to how the world is made and governed. "It is either a poor claim, or one whose merrits I am ignorant of, that anything must be, for all we see as evident could not be so. This relies on the identity of such evidence, which is, to the point, unknown." But we are left then, ultimately perhaps resting on the esteem of evidence; which to a degree is fair, and is worth some minimal concession. But all in favor of some conjuring intelligence which orders and governs all. And it is odd for this to have grounds outside of some evidence, 'for which it it is esteemed as propiating'. Indeed, there is a rear end to that, for which there is no need for evidence. But of this,  I cannot quite say what it is we think is there. In some sense, it is as if the world which is claimed to be goverend by something baser was absent, and such a base was there inherently. 
    <br>&emsp;To reiterate our argument, the world is either known posivitely, or through some mixture of this and contrivance. Or, there is no world, neccesarily at least. But so lies that realm which would contrive, floating is goes. "A world made and run by God; the faith in reason barring the belief in the latters unneccessity; and God alone, in and of a manner unpertaining to the world. I am not sure though how we know God alone."
</div>
<div id="OfLaws">
    So we say that the cosmic microwave backgorund is an observation, in the way that we observe the light from Alpha Centauri. The CBM is merely a spherical impression of light from all positions, coming from a time that the complexion of the light suggests.
    <br>&emsp;This is no law though. Just as the orbit of moon around the earth is no law, merely something we observe.
    <br>&emsp;I will grant leniance to what laws mean, if only to effectively describe them. But of there general nature, I cannot quite say. You have the second law of thermodynamics for instance, which says that all harmonious states tend towards dissaray. "A clump of particles in a chamber will proceed to distriubte themselves evenly, rather than come together." This is what we observe though. And laws, it would seem, are simply coinded deductions, of what occurs under certain circumstances. In this way, laws are esteemed as the cause, in their being a law, as repeated observations are brought by. 
    <br>&emsp;In this sense, laws are pronounced as a basis, or cause rather; as if a solid guess, or inference, to the prescence of something, 'of which the law is a denotion of', for which our observations are explained by. "It is as if a dark hole lay by your side, and every time you dropped a ball in, it came back up. After repeated attempts, you may say there is some undubitable cause which bears such effect: the law of ups if you will. Yet, you do not surely know if it is but a bend of gravity shooting it up, or some pig headed troll."
    <br>&emsp;In this way, we are left with laws of varied degrees. For it is one thing to describe bioligical laws, 'in that we see animals behave so concurently', and another as to the physical laws which govern these. 
    <br>&emsp;For what we are left with, is a deepening stamp on nature, whereby the phenomena we see are understood to a finer degree. We cannot say the basic cause of such, only, that of the things we see, that nature is so that, by our repeated observations, equal results occur ---varying but in proportion. But of this thing which we esteem as the cause of our observations, so is it unknown.

<div id="YearsAhead">
    In a quaint room, amidst a calm green country, sat a group of gentleman. Inclined to study and share, they conversed with one another, detailing their recent wonderments. But whereas these sort of occasions tended to be full of profession and prognostics, the mood of this was slighty dapper. For after a time, in which those former described the talk, one of the men simply remarked how ill-founded their statements were. Not that they were ill-placed in fairness or sentiment; nor were they lacking any weight behind their gusts. Merely, he suggested that the heart of their inputs lacked any insight as to whether or not they were wrong. It was mere words being spoken, and little judgement or doubt flown about. Better yet, there was little admission to the vainess in their proclomations, in that, upon considering the past, it was clear how much any prior time was futily wrong. "None so rightly fortold." 
    <br>&emsp;From this remark, the converse shifted, setting moreso on the simplicity of the world, and how, despite our prior claims and speaking, so was it likely to samely remain. Indeed the future is a mystery, and certain shifts will occur. "But a man, despite aging, never looses his heart, or bones." 
    <br>&emsp;As it were, their more humbled and calm remarks centered on the state of the world, and how, in the decades prior, the fortelling was that it would burn in hell; or at least whither into something dystopic. The reality could not be further from that.
    <br>&emsp;Crime remains, as does depravity. There is rudeness, brevity, pedantry and shame. Nor are the bones of man invincibly secure. There could be war, as are its ways increasingly burning its sides. 
    <br>&emsp;But in all of this, the gentleman attested to the fact, that in all metrics, the world had improved. Of all things risky and hazardous, so are they less severe. And despite certain threats being par for modernity, so is the positive side of such mountanous in comparison. The norms remain, as is the earth beneath us. But the stability which people seek, is more widespread, and not so exclusive. "A far rarity it seems, for a nation not to be as first as the last." 
    <br>&emsp;And, wrapping it all up, one of the men illustrated a reasonable way to understand this scenario. He described the phenoman of technology, and how the prospects of it always excite one to imagine, and by that, dream of the world changing. But little is this feeling ever checked by the smoothness of the past, and how revolutionary change bolts itself onto the mundanity of normal things. Moreose, that these heralded prospects, tend to be unremarked as they settle into the norm; from which the eveness of the world is gleamed, and only some other spark to our imagination can changed that.
    <br>&emsp;The point of their converse then, was that, despite the expected change, it will not be so stark when the whole of things is accounted for. Governements will be governemnts, as will economies and markets function similarly. There will borders, tress, the sun and the moon. And even upon our dreams being met, will we still need to breathe, or more actively seek food and friendship. "Blade Runner ought to have been set in 2525."
    <br>&emsp;As it were, the state of the world was such, that near the end of the century, so was it relatively the same, if not improved. "And perhaps as nicely so, the imaginations of folk had been rendered of, 'like the grissle on a steak'. And as such, there proclivitiy to dream and believe, was more tenured and factual." As such, few see the world a hundred years from now to be to remarkably different. In the century prior, the ability to see all was given, 'yet none had the fidelity or sense to do use it well'. "For which the end felt so near." But as time went on, and the pillars of modernity settled in, so did the norm become one with such advents, 'to which prospects of a similar sort were relatively less remarkable'. "Computers felt like they'd take us into a world so different and prestine; while now, near the top of the century, the imagery of time travel does not blind our view to the things which'd still be common: that we'd be men, breathing, hungry and tired: nor so bored as to care where we invovled ourselves. It is a modern treat, that no where is deemed special, to marvel at beauty, be delighted, and in harmony with folk and friend. 'Take me no where'."
    <br>&emsp;Oddly though, this modern norm is not so prestine. For despite its promise of a constance to whats common, and improvements at that, there are still those outside this stream of cheer. In proportion things differ, and that is modernity claim. But still the form remains, in that, to whichever degree, there are still those who steal, who rape, who murder: and not as nearly a concern, but rumours and gospel are no less present. Man may have bruoght those in the mud into the smoothest of streets, but so a hole remains. Part of this modern sensibility, of basic sameness, does relish in the fact that of those in the hole, so are there less so. Along with the cadence of this, 'as more folk are being lifted out than ever before'. Yet, it still haunts one to think that there are those in such despair. And indeed, the prior times ramblings and fear was significantly motivated by this fact: that there were those in need, 'for which the world was to blame for'. And even though the world has shown that she is willing to help, and is more than likely to remain normal and secure, so is she subject to scrutiny, and insecurity. For these remarks of mine are not made as to say, that all in modern life are happy and pure, while those in the hole are merely calm and waiting. There's still a dispotion to our freedoms which has not yet flourished. Nor, has there been a blossoming of the culture, as to mightily reflect our modern state. "People may not be as put off by other's squabblings and pedantry, for of the norm, they know. Yet still the squabbling lays."

<div id="ThrobbingSights">
    Asking questions is satisfying, as the whole world feels infront of you. Similar to a stressed moment, where the elements of your life get twisted and show only their harshest glare, so in a state of inquiry and cheer, do you see broadly and nicely. The love of outdoors come's to pass, 'as if a prisoner, despite their seclsion, was still graced by the sun, or moon, the birds even'. 
    <br>&emsp;I submitt though, that when we are not so cheery, or able to happily see, we get burdened by something along the lines of sympathy. For none who are truly occupied care for, or are wounded by the chimera's of man or animal's plight. But as someone who is quite deep in their sights, so is a posture which cannot stand to it, one which retains the domain; but in that, holds onto things, or at least, gets intruded with things, in a less fair or pleasing fashion. "For my world, as I see it, becomes part of me, like that prisoner, who remarks upon their entrapment with the prescence of things aruond it; for which we similarly hold our peace by the sun and moons prescence."
    <br>&emsp;The geography of discourse though is rampant in these parts. And, while I have a large and spanning view of things, so is it more of a model, rather than a exact understanding of any particular point. Suggestions then unravel me, as I have much familiarity with the subjects, but not their matter. And so, the loose story telling or commentary on such regards has a spot within me, in which it settles: but there is not meat on the bone so to speak, 'to which the impression does so fully upon me'. 
    <br>&emsp;As it were, in my finer strides, these inputs don't have as easy of access, as the spots we have wihch are more filled out, give a general aura of being filled. "Like the contributions of a forest upon the atmospehre, whereby its local point drifts up into the encompassing whole, blocking out the sun."
    <br>&emsp;What I can say then, is that we are burned with sympathy. For our knowledge has exposed us to the condensed nature of cultural digestion, and therein exaserbated our imperfections, 'wherein such inputs come in more heavily: because our general knowledge has given space, upon our vulnerability to impression that is'.

<div id="FromOutIn">
    I think the heart of intent draws from the relationship to our dad, who is someone that I love in some sense, but fear in another. For he is the one person who is always telling me what to do; and holds a certain strenght and authoirty to do so.
    <br>&emsp;But as one gets older, they are either a) less receptive, or b) better able to communicate when you disagree. 
    <br>&emsp;I bring this up though because of a similar relationship I have with the world. Simply, there is a suggestion sometimes that it is off, or at least in need of assistance. And my common experience doesn't jive with that; and I am somewhat positive of what is true otherwise.
    <br>&emsp;From this, I wish to better state things, for our sensibility is merely a means to ignore things, or be unpertubred by them. While knowledge is about solidity, in that even the roughest push could not move you. In the former's case, akin to happiness and peace, you are simply less struck by things, and by that, less prone to being drug by drama and fluff. But if you are busy or tired, or at that stressed, then you become more rigged, and more likleey to have impressions cling onto you. "Where they might otherwise slip off." Of our regards then, so our knowledge lies. For whatever we are attending to, there is not but what we know which can be used for refutation. Indeed, we may known things in a light or impartial way; or, considering the question at hand, peraps its form is made based on your 'rugged tone', to which the knowledge needed is absent. In this, we say, that be it smooth and normal, or rough and tumbly, that the iumpression dealt with be consented to or overted, based on the knoweldge you have. "Does this line up, fit nicely, or is it far off, and right to remove."
    <br>&emsp;Where we come to then, is the matter of positivity, in that, of the world, we truly see, and by that, hold room for even the most ill-set and pointed impressions. 
    <br>&emsp;As is the world bent along the inquiry of need or reason, so is life bent along the submission to ease and negativity. In one, you have concerns about whether the world as seen, and further so, is what remarks how the world is, and by this, how our actions should lie. That, or whether this is implausible, and a baser impetus is required to make, what may otherwise seem evident, so. "And whether someone can know what such impetus is, fairs a sort of reason itself: as if one proclaimed the motions of sea, and things within it. But all more likely, that the neccessities proclaimed were made in fallacy, and not thereby known." We'd say in this case, that the need for the sea to be what explains the objects in it, or rather, that the objects needed a sea, or basis, to be as they seem, for them to be so, did not rightly explain how such basis was, for, of the objects which it was the cause, or basis for, so were such objects, via our lack of faith in reason, with an identity which was naturally so; to which, we defame any baser claim, when such claim was made with the complexion of such basis in mind, rather than the mere neccessity of one; which is so, for the source for what we describe such basis on, is of the objects which it, in a deemed complexion, is so as to correspond with, in the way it is, as to produce, throught such of form of it's, the form of objects which it is the proposed cause for. 
    <br>&emsp;The point being, that the need for a baser explanation, or impetus rather, is merely so if the world is deemed to be unexplainable otherwise. "Contrasting one's faith in reason." While this is fair in principle, to propose at least via the skepticism of that which we mean to describe, so is the abscence of that lacking a block to any proposition which proclaims the nature, or rather form, of such basis. There are proper arguments as to what such basis would be, but merely on the matter, or principle rather, of there neccessarily being something at all, and by that -devoid of what there is, potentially or as seen- how it's form would be. But as we know such form based on what we suppose the inherent being is, we cannot claim to know how it is with relation to objects derived from it, when such objects are (in this case) definitively unknown. "As saying they are so (undefined), is how we draw the conlcusion of their neccessary impetus." And it is a fallacy indeed, to remain unclear of motion and substance, as we'd deem whole and natural, but therein describe the arbitrary force stated as being the explanation for that which we don't know, or feel can be fairly said, discovered or known, and therein ascribe properties to such force which are drawn from a relation to an effect which they are --in the manner of their form-- to be esteemed as causing.

    I love virtue, for it free's me to rest. For I know I've done well and can continue. Opposite of this is vice, whereby I ruslte and stir, knowning I've erroed, and am apt to continue.
    <br>&emsp;We are no man though. For a man is one who is truly like this, rightfully happy. While I am one, though perhaps wise, is but someone who's tasted the sweetness of this happiness, and danced towards her tune. But in our imperfection, we slip and drag a little, yielding to an admittedly honorable brace to what's good, and not an retreat into what's bad. But in this brace, as all those committmed naturally feel, there lies an all to flat reverence for the process of right being, or an all to gripping hold on the good it springs. 
    <br>&emsp;For in our delight, as virtue springs in us, we see the moon and sun, the trees and stars. And as we rest genlty, but tenderly too as our mind alights, we mellow into a full embrace, of our standing and sights around. We are one, upright and privy. 
    <br>&emsp;But these sights, like peak scenes from a mountain top, become handles which we hold onto when we are not so postured. When we slump, we miss those things so charmingly dear, and hold onto the pinnacle vista's. Worth noting, is that in our wandering ways, that not always are we privy to such magic. Equally are we composed, but perhaps subject to mere chirp of a bird, or calm scope of the land. These don't settle in us as the richest of vibrnaces, but merely broaden our appeal, and thus experience. This should be fine, as our posture, be it delighted by the Gods or his simple lands below, happily flows in and out of such scenery. But when our posture tightens and we can no longer see things simply, we concentrate our gaze and change position, as to see those more wonderful things. "As we feel either empty, or drawn to the plastic abyss below." 
</div>
<div id="BlurringFault">
    I'm not bitter, nor pessemistic; and never have been. For all our misgivings, none of them seem to occur but by an apparent fault. We've always experienced the opposite of this, and to such means, disposed ourselves towards. But of all things bad, there is never something which, I'd admitt, as not being wrong. 
    <br>&emsp;In that, one may simply ask themselves, in whichever way they feel and seem, would it not likely be so that the worst of this was such, if any given parameter was present? Would you not lose sleep and concentration from eating poorly or not exercising? What if your merely slept late, or missed a walk prior, or ended up with a blanket? Our experience has only shonw us such.
    <br>&emsp;I say this, for what is good bears itself through choices which, upon their lapse, blurr such goods: to which we learn. But, as remarked in the past, the beginnings of such regards usually begin with a stoutness to such fidelity, and only so. Then, as these matters become normal, so do we focus on the goods born from them, giving them more catered time and attention --as we did the means. 
    <br>&emsp;There is a confusion though, namely of whether we can be aimed for such goods, and thus their mean. For any doubt of this, or imposition, will lead one astray. And, generally, by whichever heart that is proposed to such ends, so do they move to such through thicket and mud, 'heading the contempt and scrutiny of others'. Since these are but words, and act more like oncoming winds, rather than halting storms, so do we proceed rather fully. But, since there is such friction, or tilting of our aim, so in practice do we take our goods and bank them on meeting such. Which is to say, that of the pressures we face, so do the pieces which stick to us curry our interests to be aimed at such. At least, we humour both our heart and that of success --for which were scorned against.
</div>
<div id="TheArk">
    I admitt the seperation of land and sea, as one is not so useful, nor benefited by much of the formers gains. But for interest sake, so can it be made.
    <br>&emsp;In general though, there are spots selected for certain hunts: be it wolves, raptors, terror birds, allos, sarcos, griffins or wyverns. Rexes and things of the sort hold more of a utility, and not of a mobile but bracing sort. 
    <br>&emsp;To bear all this, one may live via industry, setting up bases where metal, obsidian and crystal can be claimed. The Quetzel may then be used as a mobile pen; but otherwise, little hunting compounds can be set up, to both hold your residence and tame storage. Breeding is not so pervasive in all species; so a general station may be had; or one local to the tame in question at their respective spot, ie. wolves.
    <br>&emsp;Because taming is at the core of our experience, kibble is needed. By that, we need egg layers, and plant growing, which in total, requires crystal for the greenhouse, and secure space for the breeding.
    <br>&emsp;In terms of tools, a navy is paramount; as reaching and transporting materials is otherwise a trouble. At that, a ready supply of munitions makes such travels possible. Alongside that are the actual means to taming, namely sedation. Materials can provide solid means for darts, while basic gatherers and assembly can make abundant narcotics (and munitions). Further in the progression lies the tranq gun, which is quite usefull for taming animals in harry scenarios; be it a griffin, a quetzel, wolves and deep sea creatures. "Things in areas of danger, that more or less demand a hasty sedation. With kibble being the prompt means to acquire them."
    <br>&emsp;As for our travels, there is a novel strip of plains in the north; but it's otherwise blocked by the mountains south of it, and the rugged terrain seperating it and eastern plains. The bulk of the south is a forest, and a fairer inlet to the mountains. The northeast holds griffins and Wyverns, near Volcanic lands. And linging the southwest is a massive jungle. The western strip holds a sea, dividing spots of islands and peaks further out, and woodlands lining the rocky flats. This area is quite accessible, but lacks an abundance of resources. There are spots of them around, but the lower parts of the world hold the most ---including the rich, yet hazardous lands of the desert far south. 
    <br>&emsp;Tames begin with moderate damage and health, scaling logarithmically. Player stats are similar, but more regressive, causing you to input more as your level increases. Breeding begins fast along with maturing, slowing as time goes on. Plus, the nights get longer, requiring better lighting and mobile protection. Dino levels begin at .33, going to .66 once you get muntions, then reaching a full state once your industry is settled. Tinkering with the Ark can be sometimes effective, othertimes not. It is easy to remove dinos, but not so much to increase their prominence. Though, total values can be changed, but not so easily for particular ones. Nor changing their particualr effectiveness. I used to think that adding ultimate creatures would flesh out this concern, but this means the game is normal less you run across these creatures. The better choice, is to have less than daunting threats, yet improved ones, more common throughout the land. More alphas, harder dinos, increased numbers making it more likely you come across packs.

<div id="ADaysPace">
    The mist noticable thing is your sleep. Waking up late is quite poor, as is not going for a walk. A blanket ought be used either a) following your initial sleep, or b) if you purely would like it. You need not be averse, but cater yourself to do without, by wearing warm socks, the right jacket, and with the lamp light by your side. I contend that waking up early is so beneficial, that watching a movie or playing a game may occur instead of immediately going for a walk. 
    <br>&emsp;As walking after workouts, along with catching your breathe is good, so is walking prior. The notion goes, that the later your up, the more you have to do, to get up to speed. The issue with waking up late, is that your body has not eaten, but is not in any lively state; and so your hungry, but then slowed. In that, you have to work so much in a short amount of time. Extending this, waking up at a moderate time allows for an immediate followed by subsquent walk, each moderatley short. Waking up early can extend that initial walk; thoug, whether you take a second, or have a long one initially is unclear to me. Waking up early may not faciliate training.
    <br>&emsp;White bread is obviously killer, but raisin bagels can delight. English muffins are quire whole, but soft whole wheat can be nice. Naan is fairly whole, despite its whiteness, but so a good treat it bays. Crackers are mostly poor, some poison. But the hard wheat ones are not so off, like popcorn. Cereal has never been great, as granola bars, but akin to natural chips, so is there fairer kinds; be it the kashi nutrigrain, or basic quaker bars. Honey Nut is quite sugary, but ripe for the fairest decadence. Peanut Butter granola may serve you better, though price is not terrific. Sometimes thinner kinds of food are preferable over their counterparts, namely hasbrown patties over potatoes; as your care for one may be just in kind, and the simpler form may be what you need; as you'd otherwise wish for something of a fuller sort.

<div id="ASweetMemory">
    I know what it means to be happy. We are constantly so, and thus know.
    <br>&emsp;But saying can be a problem, as the terms used to described it tend to come from different seeds. Virtue for instance, has this esteem and flair as the thing which brings happiness, but does not then detail what such thing it brings. Similarly, hard work and a sensible mind, will bring money and success; but these, in fairness, ought be taken to mean, that more things can be acquired; and indeed we tend to concieve of this as owning a home. But herein lies the problem, in that of the former's case, the definite mean is of some object, rather than mode of being. For why is the object good? Is it not by it's relation to you, and how through it's use you are? What then is the thing which you'd wish to spring? Is it furry and might, or calm delight? 
    <br>&emsp;Most of my remarks settle on the ends of our actions. The confusion therein lies, in that such attention is not about where my actions go, but rather where they've come, 'to ends already treated'. I more or less assume that I am not going to change. And despite our view of things being off, in complexion, so do things not change in themselves. And so I notice for instance, that certain foods make me soft and mushy, while other's bring vitality and strenght. I remember this, note it, and contend myself to act with such in mind. For we all mean to do well, and none differ in this. Where we differ is in what we consider good, or set for wellness. A glycemic food is apt to have a glycemic effect; and such effect may mingle with other motions, to which we simply say, with some objectivity, that within a given person, however those other motions are, that of the involvement of something glycemic, so will any given food contribute such.
    <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is in the amendment to concerns which treat us in happiness, rather than remedying common problems present to everyone else. It is not wise in my view to worry about such things, but instead to turn one's cares to happier ends. There's a richness at least, when I attend to myself; and in doing so, there's little I imagine that those common troubles would matter to me. 
    <br>&emsp;I guess I can only be a man enough, as to be honest with myself, and be so apt and principled as not to be drug down by the squabblings of those around. For in those moments, when and where I notice, that so are we unable to contend with them, 'for of our honesty, so are the elements of it hard to state'. That I feel calm and delighted, full of rigor and deep breathes: such is hard to exclaim. 
    <br>&emsp;I find, in our fuller moments, that nothing is seen in unity, but in systems, fledging and sprouting, 'akin to every fish and coral in a reef'. This removes both our presumption of how any individual thing is, and by that, what we can expect any individual thing to be; but also, that there is thereby no whole of which our abscence of an indivudal part, collapses it. This is an odd physical property, in that things have motion via their relations; but not so much that there unified into a fabric, but instead brought to motion in company. And indeed, it is not unclear that all impacts the rest. But that any one motion is here because of some motion far away, ignores how many other motions there are in between. "Thus, making such whole concepts poor in as much as they poorly concieve."
</div>
<div id="Constant">
    Our actions ought be constant, in that they are not winding this way or that, subject to the whims of the world, or our fancy. As it were, the currents of life push us one way or the other; remarking the fact that were bobbing, rather than diposed; whereby, be it in winds or calmness, we act defintiively.
    <br>&emsp;I find that all actions are best when they treat you to a feeling of ripeness. This means a mixture of tenderness and strenght, evenly and set, and not prone to wearniness or haste. Nor ought this be bridled with ambition and perversion. 
    <br>&emsp;I have noticed these feelings, and a correlation to certain actions. In the way that a certain amount of exercise produces fatigue, so do ceratin actions bring delight. Or better yet, prime you to experience delight, by those things, whicb by your hoisted mind, draw delight.
    <br>&emsp;We are not like everyone else though, in terms of how we apply ourselves. And, as we linger in our fruition, so do the gaits of others seem imposing, or worthy of envy. 
    <br>&emsp;This is the heart of our reflections. For I generally need no assurance as to the right thing; as our experience bends us naturally. Rather, it is the definment, as not to wain under other's prescence, which I produce, as to be sturdy in our imperfection.
    <br>&emsp;For growth is a winding affair, and in your side steps or setbacks, so are you left vulnerable to the cares of others.
    <br>&emsp;Importantly, I am alone, and this is why I see others stair. For I know none who care for such delights, or live as though there are no problems. And so, if I were to have a friend, then I would surely be more certain, and at that, less liable to imposition in our impressionable state. "As I had others by my side." Nor, is our actual definition and resolve something which I can fully state. And understanding with others, would bring said support, but also a clearer interest ---our abscence of which invites such impositions.
    <br>&emsp;In that, I've noticed that eating well and exercising wholesomely, brings a sort of composure and cheer; whereby work becomes simple, your desires easily met, along with a glaze of self respect and generous attention; melding together to form a flow of life, whose past is not forgotten, nor the present loathed over, nor the future longed for, but all mooments, as have been or are to come, blending smoothly together. This experience bolsters itself by actually remarking upon whats right, so that our contrast to other people is not merely out of interest, but propiety. 
</div>
<div id="HotProclomation">
    For some reason, my gravest aversion is to the proclomation of problems. I overt myself from this, and try and minimize the extent to which others hear it. A world with problems is one of conflict, possibly at least.
    <br>&emsp;Indeed, I don't fret over issues, but rather commentry and discourse; as these matters seldom speak of the concerns in great detail, but merely exclaim them as a basis for bouts of talking. My cynicism does not lie in the extend of their speech, 'and that they merely wish to do so, and heard'; but instead in the baseness of the problems which they speak to. There is seldom notice of the many happenings of the world, but instead the pointed remarks in it. None of the elements and matter which consitute things is mentioend or adhered to when speaking, or proclaiming. And at heart I believe people know this. For indeed, hearing such discourse influences their own speaking. But merely that. For none, despite an otherwise abidement to such proclomations, every decree it to me or anyone; except for their rumblings in discourse. It is never a mark of our life, or care rather outside of our interests in remarking upon it. I'd say that our abscence of happiness, in prominence, leads me to seek resolve and amends to the actual happenings of the world. Or, more importantly, our attention to do so. To a degree this is fine, 'for in one's idle fancy, ought they dream of richer glories, than novel ones'.

<div id="LikeTheWhole">
    The oddest thing in the world  is the discrepancy between selg-giving and peacefull acquirment. Most of wisdom is aimed at the later, while some sort of sense is bent on the former. I notice sometimes I wish for, and feel repented towards, the sake of such former; though, in my finer strides with the latter, so are the concerns of the former muted.
    <br>&emsp;I feel that, outside of wisdom, there is this self-oriented view; one of which then views all things around, however wide and stetching, as united, and by that, of a certain state which you may alter; or are indebted to be rightfully part of. There is no surprise then, that in repentance and remorse, or glory even, that such feelings are in tandum with the whole of things. "Whereby our being is in line with all of entirety; to which, a grieving state will see all the world as such. And, herein, lies the pedigree of ideals: in that, ought one be as if, how they were, all of entirety'd be so."
</div>
<div id="FineCiv">
    So to great rejoice, I was able to play Civ this afternoon. Starting the game I was happily pleased, though awkwardly impressed upon the intitial beginning. A moment weny by and my mind was blown. There is so much detail in the features and improvements, and the motion of the units paired with this, makes for a rich and appealling experience. I can literally think of 100 cool things about it. And, notably, much of this is new, and not what I expected, or am familiar with compared to past civs. I have been able to get the basics up and going, but there are many specific things which I am not entirely sure; nor is my overall graps as cultivated. Namely, there are several kinds of buildings, and multiples within that. Each sort though benefits in their own kindred way. Whether base yields are important I do not know, but there is literally too little space nor enough population to have a fair amount of those, and all the urban improvements. By that, for the sake of culture, gold or science, you may focus a city down one way. That, and learning which buildings are which, be it happiness or gold buildings, will allow for land, unqiue buildings and wonders, to be seen as optimal, based on adjacency. 
    <br>&emsp;My experience thus far, is that there have been endless choices, each leading to some choice difference, or a simple boost. And there is so much choice, in governments for instance. 50 turns in and we've had 3 celebrations, yielding 20
     for 10 turns each. I am unsure about converting to cities, but almost surely, in the early game, when you only have your capital, you can literally finish turns in a moment, as the load time is near instant, and you only have the one city producing something. The use of towns is fit to uncover, but in terms of tinkering with things, it's generally your main town, with little but unit movements in between. Which, on it's own end, is much smoother; as researching sailing unlocks embarkation, and going into and out of coast (from a non-rough tile) costs nothing. Recognizing rough tpyes of terrain is an advantage when exploring or trekking troops, but generally, it is pretty easy to get where you want relatively fast. 
</div>
<div id="Blended">
    I'm sitting here then, having been tired, and near the end of the day, and having played several hours to a pleasing degree, and with a filled mind, I see that this experience is not one which we must work soley towards, nor remark as work itself. It ought, and has never not shown to not be, simple. Being well creates such, as we are steady in the moment, unassailed by the future, nor lingering from the past. We incorporate things, with out fear or lust, and thus proceed more wholly, intigrating such fuller experience; makig it easier to further be. 
    <br>&emsp;But such a process is limited by ourself. Not the goods themselves, or our common deeds, but our paramount action. For instance, if we ate sugar indiscriminately, we literally would be so poor in our activity. As we would not sleep, exercise, nor read, walk or write. Our happiness, had this been our lasting choice, would come from the company of otther people, be it fitting for such lifestyle, or directly invovled with our consumption.
    <br>&emsp;One of the issues were facing then, is in overting ourselves from anything bad, but not doing anything otherwise good. We don't eat poorly, but no exceptionally either. We don't lounge, but our exercise is unremarkable, nor consistent. I don't always feel like theres enough room or peace to lean into those better strides; but I am also indebted to this, and getting to it; for which I don't lreiqnuish myself to those lower standards. "Like were haulting, rather than turning to a poor direction."
    <br>&emsp;As an open remark, we have been hired. The process of this seems fair and managble, and not likely to be short of pleasantries. There's also much good to simply come from this, namely in our finances, and that of our stability at home. For I hold no aversion to being here, other than the remedy of being somewhere I can be happy. If we are full and well, then our lower states hold almost no notice by others; and our fuller states were never an issue before. 
    <br>&emsp;Where I sit then, is in trying to get some motion into this right state; for which I may conceive and judge fairly. Our goodness is less in preperation, as if our employment was something to be fearfull of. Rather, in our upright stride, we somewhat exceed what the good of that employment brings, and can act in the right way which it's making the base for.

<div id="OurLiving">
    If we were wise, our actions would remark a fixed principle. For, all observation brings with it respectable insight. But, as if loose threads which we sew and tigthen, so is one newly loosened one not a remark of those it's looped around. Indeed, an overly tight one will bear down on others.And so our reflections need not change based on one insight; rather, it ought contirbute the material relevant to it. Yet, like our breath, so have we observed much, mildly and deeply. And so should our actions reflect this summation, altering so much as it changes; but all the likely in degress, as the changes to the basis are (to a degree) changed.
    <br>&emsp;The most important aspect of our life, is that we sit on the floor. We do this because we experience strenght and greatness; and none of our interests feel as true and lively otherwise. As such we amend.
    <br>&emsp;This requires though a fair balance of strenght, aerobics, stability, recovery and rest. One invovles range of motion under stress, ie. pushups, squats and pullups, the other running and free range of motion, ie. skips, rotations, high knees.  Stability holds us in a gentle brace, flowing through standing twists and folds, shoulder flexsions, extensions and pauses, leg raises and back extension, along with the ripe motions of warrior and runners lunge. "There is room for our non-sagital planes of motion to be addressed, as well as how we better stretch and hold our shoulders, lower back and legs." Recovery is more active, though it is the most accomodating, being more inclined to hold, or be more flowing. While rest is a mere sensibility, to wait, breathe and grow. Let yourself be, incorporate the moment or day; be it in forms or cleansing.
    <br>&emsp;Key principle, is do some sort of standing when you wake up, going through a squating motion, ideally do some sort of  leg raise and brace, and almost neccessarily, some sort of spine flexion and extension. Runners lunge is a great treat, and if your transition is viable, go through this with everything else. And there should be a rule that at least once, you turn yourself off, bring yourself to the ground, and be with form or rest, breathe and reset.

    So the basis for eating ought be in allowances. As, only being able to purchase a limited amount of things, directs how you select things, as to round yourself out as best you can.
    <br>&emsp;As far as I know, we have unlimited spending. Not for dessert mind you, but for everyday goods. I think it's a poor, and admittedly premature, state of mind, to think that we ought spend less to save more; and otherwise use our parents funds, but in a respectably limtied way. We are going to save money by virtue of us making some, and having no expenses besides food. It also isn't worth seeing your expenditures as less here, than would be on our own. I don't know the balance of my spending or my parents, be it of neccesities or meals. But generally, I care not for an abundance of the latter; I don't need almond yogurt or PC springrolls. There's value everywhere, be it for such delights or almond milk.
    <br>&emsp;One of the things which is killing me is too little food during the day. Some organization of the food we have could aid this, but clarity moreso. I care not for grains, though having them is easier when you've waken up early. Milk and fruit seem the norm, but for whatever reason, the smoothies we used to have were way more filling. I think that we were succeeding at one point, by having nuts and kale, milk and dried fruit. Oranges are always best during the day, with tomatoes and kale early on, and carrots and nuts past that. Seeds seem the best fit for the tomatoes. And indeed, be it sickness, stress, obscurity or dissaray, not eating the kale and tomato centers our lacking. For eating is not so much about calories, but food, as liquids have this effect, whereby you get enough calories, but feel empty; and your body gets a little hollow, particulalry in the gut, and thus chest. There's too little for your colon to feed on, lowering stool bulk, satiation, and strcuture. "Making you feel like your bearing down on a smaller point, to sit upright."
    <br>&emsp;What do we need then? Well we need a balance of grains, namely in quinoa and lentils, bread and popcorn, along with milk, potatoes, all our roughage, and any thing of a delicate sort.
    <br>&emsp;Milk wise we have none, and I am admittedly unsure of the pleasure in the vanilla is worth the sugar. It may be, but honestly, I feel to ill to ingest a weakness. Delicacy wise, I'm not terribly up for frozen food, but I do admitt that our caloric intake is rather low. Though, I do feel that most of our concerns come from too little eating overall, rather than pure calories. Food we can, and will eat then, is what I seek. Quinoa and lentils being a prime benefactor of our broader spending. Perhaps some more dates, of a more preferable kind. We've tons of dried cranberries, and a mostly full bag of peanuts. Kale, tomoatoes, seeds, oranges and bananas are got at Langley Mart. Bread wise we've got a servining of the loaf, and 2 frozen E.muffins. I think that the sunharvest 12 grain is a great whole, yummy and filling food, relatively cheap to.
</div>
<div id="SomeTimeAgo">
    So I've sat on the floor for nearly 7 years now. Why? well that is it's own discussion. But for now, I can say that our observations are made with a pure basis of such endevour in mind.
    <br>&emsp;What I've noticed, in terms of worth, is that being on the ground admitts great qualitites to your life. So much so, that even in freedom I'd remain. But we'll discuss this later.
    <br>&emsp;As regards the reality of doing so, I've noticed as of late that such an act (of being on the ground) runs slightly contrary to eating food; nor is it as feasible without various forms of exercise. That, and ignoring either of these two, while still exhibiting yourself (on the floor, and via its stature) tends to wear you down; resulting in our weight loss and riggedness when partaking in aerobic training.
    <br>&emsp;Where my amends lie, is in trusting in our constancy, and worrying little of the short term conseuqneces; at least the matter which is relevant to that. As I have lost weight, and our composure is more tall than it is wide. Indeed there is some embarassment from this. But the real point, is that I hold no belief that this is due to being on the floor, or how we eat, but rather how little we exercise. This has come about from the year past, when we've been living a little off, or having to move and aid our family.
    <br>&emsp;I'll mention this here, but we tend to rest little when our stability is absent. And so our circumstances, albeit permitting of us to live, hold little room or sway to stop. "Nor care for our interests and ways for their own sake, or out of interest and delight that is, and not over bear ourselves to it, as if we have to proove it's worth, or validate it as important --against some otherwise tradiontal claim, which our abscence of makes our own something which we must embellish constantly, or be labelled as contradcictory."
    <br>&emsp;I don't mean to speak of our life, beyond that is of it's effect on our choices, as pertain to the remarks at hand. I simply wish to reflect on what we've observed, and make for better action.
    <br>&emsp;For the gravest problem in our life is too little eating. It's not so much calories, but too little food, to sparse roughage. I feel like we do this to accomodate our exercise, but we hold to much effort in leisure and craft; that we end up exercising more than we ought, and living in abudnacne, but with too little food.
    <br>&emsp;I think the biggest change ought be that we hold food in the same light as we do exercise; responding to it's effect, being deliberate about: as if it were something we had to hanlde, like exercise, or anything else which treats our condition.
    <br>&emsp;I've never noticed that working out too little is a problem, only to inconstantly. For whatever reason, we work out in large chunks, but then do to our abundance of living and too little food, we stop, and go weeks withotu doing it to any meaningfull degree. This lowers our stretching, stability and recovery. Which makes the reality of sitting on the floor, and in a rather embellsihed sway of activity (for we struggle with rest) a more famished experience. As we don't sit as comfortably or stabily, and thus wear our bodies out. 
    <br>&emsp;We ought let the long period of time which has brought us here be ironed out, and merely amend to do what is right; even if the effects of our past seem present. For we don't need to workout brazzenly, nor miss out eating because we think we have to work out. The key point, is that it may not be something you wish to do; considering, that if you did eat, that you wouldn't wish to train.
    <br>&emsp;In fact, yoga is our correction, for be it at sessions, or by your private decree, this ought furnish your means of duty and living, in both constitution and remedy. Exercise ought breathe life into this; and tends to do so naturally. But our choices or feeling may be elsewhere. But it is our ricketyness when it comes to eating and living that causes our natural means and rise to exercise, to feel bordered off, or of no interest.
    <br>&emsp;Now, as for anything specific, the first learning is that eating something for breakfast is essential, as your body feels hollow and bare. This ought not interfer with exercising later, but should come even at it's expense. Following this, we ought eat milk, fruit, carrots, nuts, protein and dried fruit, cooked veggies, bananas, and eventually grains. What we should have in the evening is unclear. But I believe, by the advent of breathing more oxygen  form the floor, the relatively concentraed nature of dried fruit, and the strenght which yoga brings, that you may, sufficiently and happily, eat lighter starches and grains for the evening; and ingest as much as you see fitting. You need not stuff your self. Over time you will naturally eat more, and should incorporate doing so via yoga's advent. So you may eat, while being upright. The moral being, that even if you must relax, and not write, or see yourself training tomorrow, that you should still eat. "For those are new expenditures: and we must reconcile what has already come."
</div>
<div id="Waining">
    My energy is low, so some positivity can strengthen us.
    <br>&emsp;The world never fails to feel amiss when we have lost ourself. We see so little, and grind against the memory that's been. And others saying what is not so fine 'is said memory', bears upon me fear and hatred; for I have nothing in the moment, and so brace my belief in what they say. "It is the positivty of the subject matter which I hold dear, and fret over when absent; but when sprung, to see negatively, I hold to much there already, 'that there short-sighted view twists my own, where the breadth we had is fit into such a shallow form: whereby the remorse in the matter, get's maligned." That is neither here nor there.
    <br>&emsp;As we have quinoa and lentils, so would corn, tuna and a compliment of grain do me well. More variety would lead to an even consumption, and more of it; as you tend not to eat when the same thing is available. It is hard, but making soups is our oppertunity. As we need something caloric for the midday, but not too weighing. Some mix of carrots, celery, potatoes and other sorts of greens would do. Cooking kale in broth would seem to suffice.
    <br>&emsp;Our training is far too absent. Were in a spot where not eating enough or living to much wares us down when we do it. Yet, not doing it at all narrows me, and causes our legs to awkwardly cross, and our stomach to overly brace. 
    <br>&emsp;I think that watching Yoga helps us in volume; and going to classes gives us a particularly rich experience, and one which ripples into our own practice. At the very least, it seems fair that we'd do sessions that are effective, and leave our elected time to round it out. I know that lifts, folds, lunges and minor amounts of core round us out, along with ground work twists and breathes. But doing them is not always easy, nor so effective. For we may do things to stringently, or to little, and our harder motions aren't accomodated well. There just needs some consistency, and all we reboot. I've never known us to flourish, or be well, when we weren't exercising, stretching or eating well. So let's do that. 
    <br>&emsp;Food is important, so get some. Iron out your stores, and establish a solid base. Sugar would indeed be fine, if only a stretch of things was not already there. When were not eating so much of the greatest stuff, we end up at thinner points. Considering you only eat so much, starting deeper means the treats and snacks will be less bare and terrible.
    <br>&emsp;For simplicity sake, I want you to do two things. Run as you will, and train with reservation, follow a guide per day, be it stability or recovery, and eat quinoa and lentils, corn, protein and grain.
    <br>&emsp;
</div>
<div id="OnTone">
    So briefly, you are in a state of tension or flatness. As much as you are the latter, so will not be as aerobic, as your general tone will not be firm enough to require so much oxygen. Being firm otherwise draws this: as even the merriest of poses creates in yoga.
    <br>&emsp;Clinching though, or ruggedness as it becomes from moving through such, becomes a hazard of being firm. There is something similar in softness, whereby you push yourself through that, but awkwardly brace, 'as what you have is not ample enough to produce'; but the effect there is on of strain. 
</div>
<div id="Collective">
    I might describe this pesky notion, so long obscure, as one of collective. 
    <br>&emsp;For one who is attending to their own efforts is no different than those who attend to a country. It's merely a matter of scope; or at least domain of attention. For I may focus here or there, but so do I only have so much. And it is quite easy to say, that people extend their view to matters beyond the commnon realm, into community, nations, society. And indeed, I feel this press, be it form TV or a friend. And their being so outward, 'or collective' as I deem it, rubs me the wrong way. As there is something natural within all of us, a condition; one which only dreams and fancy can paraly. "Yet against wisdom's show, and her proclomation that the reality will not be as you concieve." This is why I care little, nor fret, when I'm occupied, as our path is formed by our dutiful efforts; and we don't even see the realm around. "Nor are we off to do so; as what we see from the right stops of cordial to such rightneous." Whether I should attend to my health, my relations, my job is one thing. But so much as I am, so is my path accordingly carved. And via the come and go nature of this, 'as if, be it today or tomorrow, so will I return. And all things I care for or see, be it congenial or not, or measured against such scale, as being appropriate and at your liberty to address: as they build from a proper point.'
</div>
<div id="Buldge">
    I wish to wake up early, hear the birds, see the sun coming into the sky. If I could do this as the first blue entered the night, oh delight. But at the very least, I ought come up during the morn.
    <br>&emsp;Through the day, I want to walk, scooter, sit and read. Nor do I wish to fret because some nice moment is passing. The evening blue can be seen near or afar, as the setting sun. Do one then the other, in whichever order.
    <br>&emsp;I want to watch Star Trek, New Girl, Easy Allies and a comforting movie review. There's even a soft joy in Scooby Doo or Arthur. "The calm delight of cartoons."
    <br>&emsp;Watching movies fairs similar, be it horror, thriller, adventure or a fav. 
    <br>&emsp;I want to play Ark and battleifled, Civ and Diablo, things like the Witcher too. 
    <br>&emsp;I want to read about the Indo Europeans, remark upon nature's simplicity, by learning about the baseness of heat and light. Nor do I wish to catch myself on the brambles of logic or tradition. "I ought only ask."
    <br>&emsp;This is all trying of me though, in our means of sitting, breathing, exercise and nourishment. Much of what we see as required of us, hold means contrary those listed. "As they are for living."
    <br>&emsp;But one thing overcomes all, understanding. It mellows my historical view, in how fair and mundane it is: too, the base of our foresight. 
    <br>&emsp;For we do need money, a home, the means to food without scarcity; nor trepidation in our invovlements; and perhaps, as I've learned most of all, not to be so lacking in understanding, as to let ungrounded emotions pull you away from where you'd otherwise establish yourself; wherein the means for friendship, satiety and contribution are made.
    <br>&emsp;I don't believe in our fears nor apprehension. But there is a past behind us, one which has ladened the imbalances of our passions against our otherwise happy memories. In fact, our current state is such, that our memory is so pleasantly full, that remarking upon anything but seems trivial. Yet life does move on, and our paces are not always on par with such serenity. "Creeping in, the outskirts of tranquility: where the worst seem so, as they are relatively so contrast to this side of the door."
    <br>&emsp;I'd put it like this. There is a base, of which our heart is best defined. But due to vice and wear, we loose such depth, and bound ourselves from shallower levels. The result, is that we either step far and yonder, 'but with vanity as our gain', or we weep and wallow, 'knowing that our heart truly does not care'. 
    <br>&emsp;There is a buldging effect you see, of all which errodes our tranquility. And we know this, intuitively; by our unacceptence or consent to impressions or beliefs born of 'that buldging base'. That, and by experience, as our bearing of such buldging leads to a relation with the world which is not so based. "As such buldges, in their motions, tend to puff up, as the steps from them alight. But, as we overt ourselves from such strides, the buldge loosens out, and we can sink into ourselves a little. From there, our relation to life is more near and composite --rather than fleeing."
    <br>&emsp;I've not the time or energy to dispell this, but the grievence in all of this is one of melancholoy. And, for me at least, her retched brother: rancour. As we mentioned, our acceptence of the buldge has never been so. But it is not often absent. The normal response is one, where we act on it, as to be alive, 'however vain'. But in our aversion to that, we tend to pitch ourselves into it. The actions which would be had there been no buldge there, would be like those which step from it: only from a deep and dearer base. "We simply let ourselves sink into that point where we'd begin; like someone who wouldn't proceed with a crooked home: but therein had no roof over there head." And the rains of the world bear upon me in such a sinking state; as she says much in media, and tradition: expressed by folks close and far around. 
</div>
<div id="AwayAway">
    When we were young, we shy'd away from the effort required 'to grow up'. I can't say I found the ends convincing, nor was my scenario in life such, that doing it anyway in our capacity; as it still felt tough.
    <br>&emsp;As this went on, and depression ensued, along with some naievety, we landed on a personal scale; one in which our duties turned to ourself, and for ends made of this. 
    <br>&emsp;I took this to be quite extreme, as the year or so prior, I had just simply aversed myself to anything 'long term'; or when I had, I realized that my efforts were in fact not effective for so ---and this brought much depression. But upon caring for myself, namely in health and study, I found much strength in doing so. And so I amended to do this exclusively, with no sense of anything other. Till this time, my relations were sparse, and my time was spent mostly alone. This had been the color of our way through recent years, 'but in receding, from times that reached great company, to the outskirts of a few friends'. In my mind, I would never go to school, marry, have children, nor be invovled in the world --as my dreams confessed. All I could see was a road ahead baked in self regard: in it's gains and propiety.
    <br>&emsp;My reverence for this did not sway, but our idea of such ends, or abscence of common ones, did come to pass. And so I tried to incorporate myself into such world. I was much more confident than I'd ever been, but connecting with folk was tough. I'd say the only advent I showed, was that despite clinging to little (in terms of the common way), I did not proceed with no other end in mind. Whereas the time prior I had meekly tried to 'be so invovled', but upon failing, shrunk feebly into myself, so in this case I deliberately overted, and choose our personal path. It was not so fashioned as the norm, but did at least have some momentum to it. It held much of our personal regard as the aim, but did so while being occupied and with company.
    <br>&emsp;In this, I was but confidently bored. The job I had was unremarkable, and felt quite demanding. Nor was our time at home lush and pleasant. Fueld by dreams, but simply admitted by our percieved ability,we choose to move from home. Doing so felt liberating, as we held no heat from the past and any of her expecations. What we go was fun and the right to truly be.
    <br>&emsp;Only, what this right permitted was not of anything whole and solid, but a vision, a yearning. We never acted on this though, and reached a similar point prior to our move; where we were more or less happy and stable, but missing something. And because our life was still more personally arranged than with fun and company, so did this basic life weigh down on me.
    <br>&emsp;As it were, our simple ways were full of self regard and activity which sprouted from it. We never drank, smoke only with regret, slept, exercised and ate with diligence and fortuity; and all to an end in which literature, entertainment and natural love blossomed. But in this state, we were unerved by outside responsability, namely work. And from this, mixed with adolescent confidence and rooted naievities (from drugs and 'artistic illusion -of glory') I dreamt and (more or less) expected for such chains to wain. Across the world I'd thought we go, or to the big city nearby. But this was never true; and our hopefull wains remained by our idle side.
</div>
<div id="Rightfull">
    The most honest statement I can make, is that the prescence of a condition primes one for seeking happiness; as the weight around, however muted, still holds one in place; and thus encourages, and as much as the duty is right to oblige, warrants, the harvest from such amends.
    <br>&emsp;But what if sloth's drained my mind, and through the comfort of our times, or broadly speaking, the country we live in, affords me the meager ability to satiate myself, and at that, enjoy myself? What if this becomes full of grizzle and grit? Is the experience not to your liking? Where is it appropriate to go; for fear and passion may motivate you to an otherwise ideal? How ought one, in their freedom, truly be?
    <br>&emsp;Perhaps the harshet truth, is that in a lack of propiety, the standard address of life's broader claim (of you) washes off, and you become idly wanting, or depressed. "In normal times, be it in higher demand, or self regarded ones, where freshness is heralded (in freedom even), you still see the continuity of such ways, be it in health or reflection; and too, of death, illness, fortune and progeny: so their coming place is seen."
    <br>&emsp;I guess the fairest response, is that had your affairs caught up to something suitable, that so would you neccessarily be more conditioned, and by that, rightfull clear in how you oblige and benefit. Even if that stability was small, so would it be near and in your grasp. I contend that beyond our means for living, and removing the pointed aims of our past affections, that the means for children are not exhorbidant, if your wish for them is to live as well as you seek; and thus, for an end which bears simplicity as a facilitator. Nor is death and illness but a lingering threat, and one, in all eveness, holds no remores or despair in your rightfully common state. 
    <br>&emsp;Maybe there's just not enough I'd like to do. Perhaps theres too many cloudy days, nor any cemented impetus to remain healthy and pure, as to feel even the suttlest lights (of the sun and all common things). As it were, my younger years of self-obsession were solitary, in that those around me --similar to me even-- lived via a direction --regarding work, love and fun-- that remarked problems I did not have. And so too their desires, did they surround. Our abscence of such problems, via a mix of meakness and maturity, felt friction from said desires; nor was I too comfortable being aruond those who felt either afraid or emboldened against issues I did not have: or even humoured.
    <br>&emsp;Why is it though, I'd say, that writing letters is so warming, reassuring, enlivening? Does it give you a foothold in the world? And one which is based on your feet? "Compared to those who are steadily seeped in tradition?" 
    <br>&emsp;Maybe the proper thing to submitt, is that the reason I am off, or at least the thing which has me posing these questions, is that of the minor duties and personal tasks, which, upon execution, would give me a calm and rigorous lust, that so are these hard to do; and so I look for reasons why, and at that, relations with others --through writing and letters-- who feel similarly. "For none, from what I've gleamed, who are worth any esteem or recognition, did so based on some disicpline or quest, but rather the honest submission to doing the right things; things which were relatively simple, but held increasingly little room to ignore or be contradicted." In all of our lives, we live amidst those without such submission: what they do strike at, I can not say. But there is a deliberate, if not percieved air of contrition on their part: as our own submission was phony, or worth contempt. That, and they hold no postive enforcement, or at that pleasure --in that you'd happily share your efforts with someone, beyond the increased ability by their prescence. 
</div>
<div id="Letting">
    So I say, in private, but also with much solid reflection (of an empirical sort), that the needs of children are not fundementally different than yours; and considering what I need, so is there a small sum. And as for expectation and grace, of what's contemporary I will make us of and appreciate, but for traditin, or at least that which is established, I will fairly rest on. "As there are taxes and roads, so are there, in most countries, moderate allowances for glasses and dental; plus a sufficient means for healthcare. Places where this is not so, are more unique than those who provide it."
    <br>&emsp;My better times could 'be in the trenches' so to speak, with such a notion, and by that say more, but I have found much peace in the notion 'that people can handle themselves', be it in war, crime or depravity. We hold no fear or rancour regarding illness, so why not those? Like a parent, I am ready to let my children go; and realize that it is me, in all our fright and garulity, 'that we picture and or imagine horrible things happenings; and that those suffering, do so with helpless agony and despair'. Yet, if we look at ourself, and those 'whose selves' were privy too, so is the user, or subject to any experience, not so as your mind leads you to believe. And I compare it to being in a passenger seat of a car, and going quite fast, and you have a sort of tense constriction at each halt and bump; and all the likely because you are not the one driving. But if you reflect on your own time driving, and thus what the driver in this case is in resemblence of, you know that the process of stearing and accelerating is almost effortless, and worthy of no fright. "And it is by counts, a soul mark of me, that had I been in someone elses shoes, I would not feel as I imagine them to be feeling."
</div>
<div id="ToandFro">
    Tradition is but a farther stamp of memory. For you father tells you how to live, as reflects his experience. And the bare notion, is that as I have lived, so will the world remain; and as such, ought you live in accordance with what I've learned ---as the arean has not changed. Tradition is but a longer mark of people's response; in that, of the world and how she's been, so are the deepest elements continually dealt with. "Giving tradition her guise of wisdom: as she shows what is most important to attend to."
    <br>&emsp;I say this, for one's condition, as come or present, is quite obvious in it's effects. One hungers for food and warmth; or feels stress when their offspring have to little --by what they can afford.
    <br>&emsp;As such, it seems that all but what could happen, and has not yet been experienced by you or anyone past --who may then impart it--- is all that lies as any unclear concern. For imagine a deep breathe and how well it calms you; and then imagine a parched breathe, in which your left wanting more. This reflects a balance already in motion; and if you were in the state of the former, so would you be in pains abscence --or whatever the abscence of breathe would effect. It is possible that such satiety will change, and an even deeper breathe is required, or more. But therein lies tradition, or the past rather, telling of 'the breathes which have been satisfying, and their aptness to change'. Literature, or study, can tell one of how things have been across millenia. While the words of your father can bear sense of the common path of a man; in that, of his breathe, so has a good one been fine; nor was there a ever a needed change. You may not be like him, or perhaps the enviroment currs effects. But at least on the face of it, the air here is more or less equal to the air there, and anywhere: and your mere ability to breathe, and perhaps well, satisfies the point. "If this is not forseen to change, then one can be both filled and by that stable, nor with remorse at the current calm, as if it was bound to change. One's confidence during a task brings a comparable cheer, in that being ordained to something brings little stress when your means to it is beyond capable. While someone asked to hit a target --and with an importance to do so--- sweats a little when they feel the loosness of their string." 
</div>
<div id="">
    This may be saying too much, but the most important remark of all is in the disparity between the past and new experience. For what is good, or to be concerned with, holds it's prevalence by a minimum degree, from what has so far come. Our very prescence as people suggests there was someone who gave birth to us. And, as such, as you worry about your friends, or the world, so do those who came before wish for you to do well; and by that, reference what that means, and how it is achieved (or imposed against) based on what has come so far for them. "It is odd then when they grow up believing something to be a certain way, then, by the broadest degree, a new discovery is made; and so are we all parsed to update our amends."
    <br>&emsp;Where my thoughts are going though, is more along the lines of acquiring new experience. For if one is struggling, to breathe we'll say, or to meet a certain itinerary, they tend not to notice, or be eligble if they did, when it comes to new experiences: perhaps new itineraries. "I find, in principal, that this is why people enjoy sunsets during a vacation; as they are by definition not so occupided, and thus notice it, and relish."

    Saying what things are is a great remedy to chimeric dispair; as the impression that something is a certain way, but of a glaring, disorted kind, makes one grind up against it, 'as not to let the illusion in'. But when one here's rumour of a ghost, they pay little attention, 'as the oddity is quite clear'.
    <br>&emsp;By that, I say that twitter, for instance, is nothing more than a forum. Nor is Amazon different than a marketplace. In one you shop alone, whereas a literal market may see you interspersed with folk. But, amidst the common grounds, be it in a market or the public square, there may be spots where people actually mingle and discusss. Politically, there are places strictly set for this. Online forums are merely this in the public realm; though, the government does include itself when it announces something. By the advent of radio and broadband, the forum in which people engage is from any point that such waves are recieved. This contrasts the literal forums of governance; where the correspondance is done in physical rooms. 
    <br>&emsp;A news broadcast, or radio station, are really just channels which others can tune into. The difference from online media being that in those, the activity is one of converse, 'in that you post, comment or reply'; while in broadcasts, or of those who do more than interact with that which is made, are merely putting organized expressions onto the air. Be it for education or entertainment, profit or fun, they are using the waves as means of output; no different than those put out their own response. "Perhaps its fair that we grant the format of this as a sort of design, as to house and parlay expressions and response: each though, being an upload, or use of the wave: for in the latters case, they are still outputing their own expression, even if it was spurred by someone elses."
    <br>&emsp;
    <br>&emsp;
    <br>&emsp;One of the great remissions from despair, is that from your choices, which holds the bar for right and bad, you set yourself at a point where things with a bothersome nature appeal to you; or better said, you actually partake in them more, for without a better composure, 'you lean on those things fit for a lesser one'. And it is a mere memory that other things were better: causing much resentment to those things. 
    <br>&emsp;Is it the fault of porn and twitter that you fret and flounder? Perhaps these things do have nature's which make you so: but is it your choice to consume them? And to then place all your frustrations with them, and not recognize that, along with their troublsome nature that they hold comforts and pleasures ---like all insobritous things-- that you thus consume them for your interest is such; and perhaps, to a neccessary degree, 'as your lack procurrs no other interest or delight, to wholer things?'.
    <br>&emsp;
    <br>&emsp;
    <br>&emsp;I think about the concerns I have, and whether there's a difference between my duty to drive well, as to provide just conditions for other drivers; compared to whether or not they drive safe as well, as if I can control that: ought I merely be aware of them not doing so, but for my own benefit: as none expect, nor even claim ability, to notify someone of another's poor driving. "There's little communication on the road."
    <br>&emsp;Similarly, if a rabbit hops along, or a family of racoons, there is nothing I can do, nor feel responsible for, in whether they are fed, or experience the risk of traffic. I ought not shue them or interfer. But, man is part of nature's garden, 'and I ought not fret if some bug gets trapped by a spider'. And it is quite nice to breathe in this sentiment, as it puts the emphasis on a possibility which I am not, to a large degree, concerned with, and rightly so. But, in doing so, the sorrow I feel is at the very least not one of venom and spite: as if the spiders are mean and wicked, 'seeking to blunder the  interests of their prey'. "Accidents are the perrils of most, in that each goes their way, looking for what nature provides: but in that, albeit sometimes butting heads, generally fair no evil beyond the point they collide." The injuries of those in Botswana are not, in those respects, my concern.

<div id="Accounts">
    So this is not some obscure notion needing clarity, but a useful one to divulge.
    <br>&emsp;Simply, we spend so much time balancing our accounts, making sure the income is fair, and that our expenditure is solide. And I am not making the point that such matters are false. Rather, I am trying to say, that comparativley, we little effort (of the same sort) when it comes to the balance of our lives.
    <br>&emsp;What this amounts to is neither here nor there. It ultimately comes down to remarking upon your actual duties and pleasures, cares and fears; and tailoring these as to make them smooth, as we'd want with our finances.
    <br>&emsp;Where this comes to pass, is that most folk, be it in passing or close nearby, make judgements about our ways: be it in finance or our lives. I find that in both, little is actually well-placed, 'as if one thought I was being exhorbident, when in fact a larger pot of gold would not even make a dent'. Especially though is this the case in our lives. For I believe that few elements of it are accounted for because we presume what they should be; nor, of the things which we grant recogition, do we also grant much worth of attention, 'in part because we deem it out of our control'. 
    <br>&emsp;And so, when you recieved scrutiny or encouragment regarding expenses, but with not basis in how your finances are --via ignorance, or innaccuracy--- that so does this occur with even more prominence when it comes to course and conduct of our lives: where the remarks made on grounds even less resembling to how we are.
</div>
<div id="Effects">
    Were drawn to things in an open way, just as we close ourselves off, in the sense that we stiffen, for things were averse to.
    <br>&emsp;But the process of action, whereby our openeness or closedness progresses, is whole in part of the 'becoming open'. For, in a negative sense, it is not so much the consumption of sugar which derails me, but the progression of our body from the state it was prior, and heading, to the one it is now and heading; whereby it softens, yet also stiffens. And nothing, by these counts, is good or bad, but causal of effects, or in other word processes. 
    <br>&emsp;Consider kinetics and a body of molecules. Adding energy will cause them to move more, and further bounce around. All that occured though, was that some accompanying bounces (the energy) were added, causing the others to also bounce (via the effect of collisions). A mere process, rather than a change. 
    <br>&emsp;This is a very literal way of viewing your actions, as you care not so much about ends, but of the procession which certain actions have. "Hangovers don't cause pain, but delays; as you more than likely return to how you were; perhaps inclined to pause again, or proceed as if it didn't happen." 
    <br>&emsp;By this, it is fair to account for the entwined effects already upon us, be it in breathing, posture, eating and stress.
</div>
<div id="TightenedLane">
    I am in this spot, where the idea of being open, is all I've meant to exclaim. 
    <br>&emsp;Yet, there's a contrasting force, spurred in time by a mix of desire and fear: the ego, as they call it. 
    <br>&emsp;For in our growing years, our openess could not be fully achieved, and thus, by the load of our condition, we instated rewards, and depleted fears. While now, having reached a mix of stable freedom, we are not so drawn to such rewards, but to rather be as we abily are. "For we need no promise, or remedy of other's concern." 
    <br>&emsp;Fear though runs down my side, as the common frets of others act like debris from a fire, 'clouding our judgement, or sinjing us as it wofted over'. 
    <br>&emsp;In a weird way, we've learned so much about the world, as our illusory consumption of it felt to pressed upon; in that, if we wished to substantiate our freedoms, so could we not rest with the perceived assumptions around. That violene was how it was portrayed in film, or that the world was woddled about as gleamed by pithy press conferences. I felt myself ignorant of such things, and feeling like 'my innate knowledge and fair experience' could not suffice, 'against the simply and world contentions of others'. "I was not free to be sympathetic or concerned myself." So I read memomoirs, tightened our historical lane, and by that, gave levity to our balanced impressions of the world. "For the root in all of this, was that I could state more clearly how the world was, in regards to violence and depravity: and this gave the truer complexion, of red strands on a grand garmet."
    <br>&emsp;These red stains though, only appear mild when the garmet is clear. Which is why, in our view of media things, 'the world appears on fire: as the garmet presented is at least 1 size too small.' 
    <br>&emsp;Thereby I stand, wondering what to do. As I see that our disturbance of such impressions, is more to do with the belief by others, 'in that they feel that such garmet (as viewed) is true'. 
    <br>&emsp;Where I am left standing, is in the near abscence of threat, 'as their ardent view that the world is ending merely perturbs their ability to speak on more common matters: as simple spending and budgets are pillaried against the broader demise." Despite this being a little unpractical, and despairing by mere sentiment, the real blurr is that, besides these edges, there is in fact nothing of concern for me. "As we are either positively accepted and flourishing, or are neutrally regarded, and more or less upright by our own means, to the same degree.There are but little embers and tuffs of negativity."
    <br>&emsp;The question then, with, mind you, the consent to potential contraiety in needing to ask, 'what, upon freedom, ought one do'?
</div>
<div id="NewFaces">
    So I met Reza today, who is the assistant to Dev. He was quite nice, a litte forward, but not in fact stern. I met another girl Kendra, solum and pretty, who was speaking with Reza twice; and I found it interesting that he was prodding her to come in on her off day, and she was laughing with him in defiance. This really showed how familiar they were with eachother, and how he, despite being the boss, was not in any way mean, or grumpy. She and I actually spoke for a moment, and had as fair a connection as one'd expect.
    <br>&emsp;At first I met Morgan, who showed me in and where to put my scooter; he gave me a ridiculous yellow coat, then left.
    <br>&emsp;Sam was the first person I really met. She was a concierge leader, and one of those go-to department workers. "A sort of funnel between all things." Another guy (long haired) named Josh came in, and he was seemingly her equal. He was nice, and depsite my passing remarks (while working), he was quite kind and amiable. She was easy to talk to, and responded to some levity regarding work.
    <br>&emsp;To my happy surprise, Joey was still there. I only saw him for a moment, but it was great to see him. Alex, who I at first forgot, was also there. 
    <br>&emsp;Then I met Mozhjan, or Moji, who ran orders with me most of the day. She was from Iran, and we spoke the most out of anybody. She was sweet, calmy earnest, and not dumb in her lack of english. We had a very pure co-worker connection, 'in that I shared a bit about my family'. She's just one of those people who is polite and pleased to see you, and says fairwell.
    <br>&emsp;Kiana was a girl I had seen while shopping. "Big and Beautiful, but curvier rather than large --as some of the women are." She was hispanic though, or at least ethnic --by her accent. I passed her while picking, introduced myself, and felt on par with her through the day. A similar thing happened with Kendra. What tends to happen, is that certain girls are hard to connect with, and you just don't speak with them. Be it nerves or interest, this just occurs. So it was nice to acquaint myself with her, as I wasn't stuck in this awkward abscence. "Much better to be familiar and absent." There was a girl named Swatee, who was quiet, persia and somewhat pretty, but of a rustic sort. Same thing; introduced myself, 'and asked my how lunch was later on'. Great to be on par with everyone as such.
    <br>&emsp;Vernon was working with Sam, and he was nice and helpful. Some guys like him can be kinda duds, but he for a moment showed interest in me, asking about our first day.  Simple and uprigth.
    <br>&emsp;Austin was in my view the weakest worker. He went slow, sat near the desk and checked his phone. Didn't seem interested in helping. 
    <br>&emsp;There was an older lady, who I blandly said hello to. She was Farenzah.
    <br>&emsp;Then Audi came in, and he seemed quiet, but then talked with Kendra, so I thought more of him. A young guy named nick came in, and at first I thought him a bit high on his briches. He was sick, but was more or less kind to me as we ran orders. He and Audi were young buds, and Josh too. But this was more from commonality, which I lacked. I asked Audi about his name, as I thought it was abi, and he was good to me.
    <br>&emsp;Started my shift at 9, having left near 12 minutes prior. Started running orders right away, and things were a bit slow. At 1030 I got to go for a pick, which showed our ricketyness, but also the greatness of picking. At 1230 we went for a break, brought our scooter merrily through the store, went home, sat for 12 or so minutes then came back. We had lost our bag, and thus spent a few minutes before leaving, so the whole ordeal could have been much quicker. And it is near effortless to come back and be ready. After that, I had not eaten much, but the time went by relatively smooth. Not to busy, talked rather firmly with Moji. At 340  we went for lunch, and this is where I really noticed not being able to stretch. We do have the option of taking two fifteens, potentially near 4 in this case, and at 230 prior. Depends if were picking, but having a quick bite of trail mix, then going for a stretch, seems to hold us up amidst our ware and despondence. After our break the day seemed over, but a forever off. Then it got busy, and tiredly, we worked through the hour. No one was there, so I left through the door, and have somewhat of a headache. We work on Friday, same time, and would like to get a workout in on Tuesday. Our cheescake hangover did not help us, and the asbcence of stretching and a bungled first break, made evaerything more weary and unsure. Even our feeling going in was one where we did not know how to enter. Now we have a fob, can more or less leave our things with our scooter, or at least prepare what we want at home. We can take water with us on a pick, and although Devs tolerance is not understood, as Reza's is, I am with little doubt that we could't through a headphone on. I didn't sob without it, as the course of our day was such that it was with meaning itself, 'rather than some burdened means'
</div>
<div id="ThrownOff">
    Many of my apprhensions come from our proximity to family. As their attitudes always saturate our own, 'while that of others tends to slide off'. Were too attached, and by that, subject to their prevalence and authority. 
    <br>&emsp;But this is more of circumstantial problem, rather than an enditement to our deepest way. As I tend not, in our own studies, in all their wonder and breadth, to see anything as I do, when sparked by ardent viewpoints, or glances at the news. It so happens that these things come up, and principially, we cannot rest with these absent of mind. "For there mere prescence tugs at me." This is what I don't care for, but indeed it raises the question, or point rather, what ought I do.
    <br>&emsp;For I believe somewhat, that if we weren't exposed to these things, that we'd move through the world more or less positively. As only our own problems would be of concern. "And the world would not be so visible otherwise, as we were more content and set on things near and local."
    <br>&emsp;Because we are at home though, and to some extent, with folk who helm themselves similarly, it seems that we are endowed to properly be, 'as opposed to enjoying some of our peacefull bliss'. For I do not know what to do, or which feelings and aims are built on strong grounds, rather than unfit passion. My reflections only suggest, and not without blood on the scalpel.
    <br>&emsp;In other words, we may live as seems fitting, whereby the oddity of worldy joy, mixed with the awkward abscence of any according regard, feels worn by the gormet astutness of the news. "As if other people, in being so squished in it's shallows, sit as though they are so invovled with such matters." Our massive approach tends to give us much reproach, nor any natural elation at the sparks from a fire across the coutnry, or world. Again, this is without disturbance, as being on the softer end of this, however fine at heart, leaves me somewhat perturbed at the things people are watching, and otherwise resentfull of their apparent ardence towards it. This makes me feel like our broader view must be firmer, otherwise we are to accept their view, and the authority at that; or feel ignorant and or blissfully reproached from things. But this removes our worldy love and wonder; and in many ways, sucks all the air out of our enormuos balloon ---from our studies and reflection.
    <br>&emsp;There's this natural lift which comes from someone well read, but not so pasisonalty or irritably involved. Glory, relief and fame can sprout from this, in our passionate state; but so in our firmer strides lies those greens of openess, 'where we merely see, and with rest proceed, to the things we see; in craft, leisure, honor and liberty'.
    <br>&emsp;Yet, without the preface of this ending with the flairs bade by passion, it is not clear how we will ever be anything at all. And this ends up making the world feel either far, dangerous and chaotic, or as we truly see, but in need of definement. "This is itself a sort of bare passion, as if we need to assert the path were on."
    <br>&emsp;Ultimatley I do not know what to do. For, with some vice, we deem the world well; and of its parts which are not, our view of such does not resemble the actual bits and pieces of such portion; nor is it ultimately my concern. "I cannot stop the warlords of Africa, nor those stricken by aids." Where I somber then, is that this natural gait, in which the pithy troubles of modern life are not pouted over, and I distance myself from ignoring the real troubles, while admitting our vast inability in terms of them, so does our relatively free and privalged place within such comparison, leave with it (from some passion) a view and claim, which is somehwhat genersous, but otherwise dear and pleasing. "I believe this is but our own point down the common lane." 
    <br>&emsp;But here lies the conflict. That such a view, where the good was what I plainly recieved, is in fact not so just; as, we don't genuinely have it, 'for it does not lead to anything beyond ourselves, as being truly free would, as you'd be open.
    <br>&emsp;In total, I have no remorse for our guilt, but rather an isolated despair, at the pungent critiques of the world, 'as if it were truly that way, or at least encapsulated by said critiques'. For when I am open, it is in the world, and as such, my relevant contribution to it in whole, is proportionate in time as the effect is aimed in weight. But if I am not so open, or at least impressed by the critiques I see, that far off lane, 'in which our life is arranged to the world', does not hold its clarity, 'but instead get's swarmed with those saturated views'. 
    <br>&emsp;I submitt that our energy is to low to inquire and mend, the core trouble in my life: which is, the thin protests against the world, 'and the restless fear and contempt for it, plus the hollow judgements born from its critique', bring reasonable doubt, but also a solitary aversion, 'as if I didn't have to energy to be even somewhat better than them, as even that felt some poor', that I am curbed to a private progress, 'in which our doubts are ironed out, and our flatness becomes a memory, amidst a cheerful and sensible constance'. 
</div>
<div id="NeuralDoubt">
    There is a positive response to everything. Doubts of this, suggest something neccessary, 'for how did such motions begin'. And indeed our inquiry lay.
    <br>&emsp;But I'd like to describe things, or remark upon them as objects we normally see. Here lay identity.
    <br>&emsp;For I think of our heart and it's beating, our mind and it's way. And I think about the reflections we have, or images, and how they sometimes frigthen us; and how this seems positive, in that, of your response, so is it to what appears to be there.
    <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, as a sort of form to this principle, is that a brain, in all it's working conduct, operates as seems natural; in that, if it creates images, that so would we remark upon them as so. But, as to render off the doubt of how we know, we merely say that so is our brain, or a complex amidst that which creates the sensation, is similarly real, and by that, also responding. "Our idea of self and its orbiting ways, need not rely on some seperate motion; but incorporate it with the rest, as we do organs and tissues." For in that, our doubt is properly laid.
</div>
<div id="ALittleWell">
    I'd say very confidently that things are well. Swell even. But I will admitt that I am a bit off. In less acceptable ways, our yoga has been short, and thus our recovery from the stress and work prior has left me doing too little, and thus a little bare. I am not sure how to return to a more ample state; but I do see, that despite the obvious effect from not working out, 'that it was from the thinning trunk that such abscence occured, and so ought we restablish that'.
    <br>&emsp;Most of our yoga is there, in guidance, be on the floor, standing, quick or long. I do need something that will bring us into downward dog and lunge, even boat or squat. But the road is clear here, 'and we were simply too cluttered before, in order to partake in the jumble of vids'.
    <br>&emsp;Eating wise were good, and will surely return to more wholesome foods upon our activity increasing.
    <br>&emsp;I think our life feels broad, yet somewhat drooping; as we've only so strong of linens, 'and like a long rope, so does it's natural give cause it to dip in the middle. There are many aspects to this, namely in our positive address of the world and the use of modelling, 'as to simply say, on such basis, be it principled or presumptuous, that so our thoughts lay'.  I wish to write more about light and vision, and gather some accompanying ligments of measuremt devices and thermodynamics. And I see overall, how being open is really all I seek, and is in fact all I'm good to do. "For there is an irony in wishing for something, 'even if it is of some grand plan born from your private ways', when such ways are in fact procurred and developed by our flourishing means to readily and rightly do them: wherein the care and nerve for such plan is bare. That, and you naturally see far off, and by your grated stride, reach it. Which is to say, we are happy to be so open."
</div>
<div id="SomeChoice">
    Looking at some of our concenrs, they tend to fall on the range of foods we eat. For I am abvoe mentioning our choice not to each ice cream or chocolate. But, as regards granola for instance, so is this not some blatant averson. I decide no, but as such, 'rather than it being outside the question'.
    <br>&emsp;Where the question lies, is in the grazing foods of bread, bags and or fried food. Dumplings have been nice, despite there time requirments. Bread has always been nice, but is not generally exciting. Going for naan has shown otherwise, but does cost a fair bit --with each piece being 2-3
    . I'm unclear though which of the three resterautns require a minimum amount; as I like to go, and getting 1 piece would be enough. There is the whole-grain loaf at superstore, but this is not terribly special. "Something you may bring home from work, but not go back to get." Popcorn remains satisfying, as do potoates and hashbrowns; though these latter seem a little thin. A recent advent is yogurt. Similar to bringing home oat milk, you may go pack for 4 mini yogurts, or a solid tub. The latter is a bit expensvive, while the former are less than 4
     on sale. And they are fairly wholesome. Chips have never been an issue as we get the all-natural ones. But there are an avocado made variety which is somewhat acceptable. A true moderate treat, 'that djon honey'. And I did see some good looking lentil, bean and rice pre-mades in the international section. "A bit more full and hearty than Old Ben." And besides this, are packs of spring rolls, be it the red ones, or the better value at Fresh Co; which also has banana chips. Similar to granola, I choose not to have corn nuts, though perhaps a fairer variety can be known. That, and seaweed is a great munchy, with little cost.
    <br>&emsp;As regards training, I feel the need to do some, and let my body take it. I think our use of yoga ought recover us after work, and thus bring more training afterwrods. "This time, we did not reach that point, and shed off much of our gains." Similar to free range, where it's about reaching a point of exertion, training requires comparable bouts of squats, pushups and pullups, and some mix of running. I think for our purposes, we ought let running be rinse, rather than a core part of the circuit. 
    <br>&emsp;Treat each exercise as seems fit. Squats are about patience, as you could relastically do a 100. Drop, then pause, then drop again. Do this twice. For pushups, drop, pause, be it stabily in plank, on the ground, on your knees, in forward fold, or downward dog, then drop again, and do this twice --returning to standing in between. Chin Ups are hard, and perhaps we might simply train at home, then go scooter to P.athletic to run. But I say this because our garage bar is solid for easier training. Using the parallel bars at Eagle park will do though. And I would say, that keep yourself going, but with fair rest. My hesitance is in whether you can do more than one set, and if it's not better to just do multiple bouts in one contain sequence, pausing for longer in between. We'll see. 
</div>
<div id="OurEgo">
    So our judgement get's thrown against the cliffs of our ego. As such is a cementing of what we know; and thus, contrary views fit little.
    <br>&emsp;The soruce of this cementing is fear, or desire. The source of these is generally your parents, common fears and the toil of labor. 
    <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is that the world is full of discourse. Generally, all are seperate in their little groups, and thus speak in terms of such group. "Everyone is who is  part of that group." I have no problem with this. But, in our less than open state, we are perturbed by judgements which reflect the fact that there are other groups out there. 
    <br>&emsp;One of the great perrils of this, is in fairness or pretensionous, the words of other's run up against our ego. This is so, for what they say may burden our clinging belief. And the response is so critical, as we either deny, or ignore out of invalidation (of their part, as we deem). But there are also melancholic responses, whereby you don't assert or digress the viewpoint, but let it stand. Indeed, our ego, or sensibility, ought not be so rigged as to not accept other points, 'and let them come in and slide out'. We've experienced this, in ease and positivity. But despite our reproach to others, or allowance, so may we not be so light and ample, and by that, 'sure in our own righteous way: whereby were fine to hear and accept'. Instead, our memory of this may serve us the proper response, but our state may be so as to not be but consumed by such point. Anger and resentment builds, as you feel your beliefs being torn at, and you wish to affirm otherwise. But your past pleasure, or strenght, lets you sit with it, albeit in a sunken state. "And indeed, the familiarity of this, or view of it, is such, that when this oppression is but minor and poking, you feel so unsure of whether it will ever go:  as something so mild has no right to be deemed uncommon, while something terrible may be seen as a novel moment." I fear this melencholoy will not go, 'and the root of that sulleness, is that when your core is so fine, and you affirm not, there is a ember of truth to the point given. As your flatter state, albeit willing to take in, holds no settled matter --for which our past time gives means to let in at all.  But without it's own color and flair, as to happily take in and otherwise proceed, it seems like what's coming in as what there is at all'. Indeed, the cause of affirmation is clear then, in that, of what's coming in, we disagree. And so it feels all too painfull when such impression is more or less consented to, 'as you fully take in, but have nothing that naturally witholds it from becoming the truth: as the bones of what you settled on prior, is flat'.
</div>
<div id="OnJudgement">
    So I see that most concerns come down to judgement. As this proclaims some sort of meaning. And to be clear, saying something is good or bad, is a judgement that effects of a favorable or non favorable sort are going to happen. "Do this, it's good for you: you'll like the results."
    <br>&emsp;I have noticed, at least I can clearly say, that of the subject in question, that I am not always on board to heed to such judgement. For, like Descrates, I don't think anyone judges better than another, but rather, what we use in our judgements, in terms of the matter of the subject. For, if someone says that their evaluating whether a meal is good or terrible, I'd say their consideration of whether it is so horrible reflects deeper pretenses, of perhaps expectation, justificication. Or, better said, someone may simply say that the food is poor because of the way that a waiter spoke to them prior. Which is, in point, nothing to do with the food; but also not something which tries to convey the meaning of the food, and thus what is relevant to me. "Only the service is concerned with such matters." And even if we spoke of the resteraunt as a whole, and someone was so heavily agasint it due to that experience with the waiter, that so might their judgement of all its parts be immoderate, 'do to the heavy weight of that one poor aspect'. 
    <br>&emsp;Indeed, be it on reddit, in conversation, or on tv, you can see the hilt in which people's judgement rests. 
    <br>&emsp;The point is not so much about motive, as if they have some agenda. And, thus, we are not struck by any suspcion of there being so. Rather, when we suspect that the material which their judgements are formed of, is dissproporiante, or at least absent when it comes to relevant things, then we see the judgement as somewhat small and hollow. "Indeed, and I submitt this with full acceptance of our ego being tainted, and thus, with care to bring this to submission, but when it comes to the judgements which overt me, 'at least, those which spark my eye as being hollow', it is those which have this shiny appeal, be it of authority, rhetoric, tradition, even expertise, but that the mold of the judgement, in all its candor and hue, seems based in response to the fact that other people are also judging, and that by this one of our own, so is it so, in importance, simply because others are also stated." 
    <br>&emsp;I  think a solid case in point, is when the actual meaning of what people say, in that their was some true consequence, they bring up points like, 'our democracy, and the government', which ends up being a bold way of saying the least about the whole. And where my arrogance lies, is in the grafted confidence that our sensibility brings, but seems halted by some esteemed prediction that countries are going to war, were loosing our license and liberty, that crime will pluck our eyes out. The issue, is that these are all  objects dripping from some high ideology. Rather than remarking the reality of pipework, be it in the fabric of laws and jurisdiction, or literal water words and service, it remarks more about ideas. "And in many ways, my attribution of vice to the predictions which come from this, come about because we think that world ought be better regarded." This holds our key though, for in that sense, when it is not in memory but a current openness, then we are not so rot to defend it, and by that, tear down the words of others, who speak beyond such basis. 
    <br>&emsp;Indeed, our happiness is right, but not in our conduct. If it were, we would not have to pull down others, but rather exhibit our own words from such basis. "I know not though, what we should do when we are not so boutfull; and whether or not it is truly bad to hear others. Some admittance is fair, as in rest, so in idlenes can you enjoy and listen. But so, in the nature of your stillness, in its friction and gruff, and all the passion and affirmation to boot, ought you be cautious, as not to see, and from there respond, to others words. I know this is sound, for it speaks not even of their basis: as your own abscence makes you wish to hear nothing, poor as is likely, but even of that which is solid."
</div>
<div id="Weaves">
    I'll say, for the sake of definition, that all things amount to, innately, what they are, but through that, amount to nothing more than a form, a property, be it in numbers or width, and as such, exhibit themselves with such properties, as the thing they distinctly are. "As a group and person are both things, differing merely in properties."
    <br>&emsp;There is nothing in the world which does not fall down this line. Seeing as the world is full of things, it is clear, that all things weave amongst eachother;  but almost neccesarily miss many. A knot here may cause tension on a string far out, but so is this an indirect effect, and the actual relation in that string far out, is of the cause it recieves;  which, however sprung, is not by those who pushed, but of the end of their action which they recieved. And ought our judgement, in being concerned with action, care only about that: less we are going to do something about those who we'd explain as initiating such cause. Just as one's parents are not the cause of their offrsprings crimes, so is a crime in Florida not to be blamed for the effect it has on the economy in that state, and how such state interacts with your own. How your state receives effects from Florida can be explained by one of it's crimes, but it is the effect which said crime procurres in Florida, and then exhibits itself in the relation between Florida and our state, that we can properly say, as regards us, is the cause. "For even if one is stressed about what someone said, and in their lapse of attention hit someone with their car, so the story goes, but their place as the driver is judged no less."
</div>
<div id="DespiteOurTrust">
    Something we ought admitt, besides our ability to deal with something bad, and by natural extension of that, other's ability, is that something bad may in fact happen.
    <br>&emsp;And like many things, the judgement we offer is only sound, when the scenario at hand is properly stated; but also the value's in question. 
    <br>&emsp;For the ultimate plea of someone in trouble is so, that of the force invovled, ought we defeat it. But of their actual experience, ought we not forget who they are as one subject to such force. By this, ought we remark fairly upon our fears, and whether they are of ourselves, or in sympathy; and if the latter, to which extent? "For we don't simply mean all those who are far off; as many are more ore less fine as we, in their own comparable locale."
    <br>&emsp;And so it is far beneath the abilities of man to esteem and or proclaim a shadowed view of something, 'whereby nothing but a point is addressed, while all else is caked in shadow'. And it is another, that, within reason, that our place and other's is not also pointedly met, but as broad and complex as the situation at hand. "There is indeed a moment where the blade enters one's heart, but ought our sympathy not extend to the trepidation prior, and labor in reaching that." And as one's whose fears are more than likely in sympathy, ought we not be so clouded, or drug rather, in such discomfort, 'pointedly'.
</div>
<div id="Ambivolent">
    I have no genuine interest to end wars or sickness. Indeed, by our common sense, we may see, as perhaps propelled in our lingering state, a calmer view of the world that we wish to share; but generally, I am in such world and not looking to express this. But we may still: but it is merely of the problems which are not. "The root of which, in our contention of those who claim otherwise, lie in family and experts."
    <br>&emsp;As remarks expectation, you may say, that good or bad things will happen, and that we may be gracious of this, or otherwise formidable; or we may be dispondent, or broken down. And so may we see this in other people.
    <br>&emsp;There is just too little constancy in our life. We've been coming hither and fro, to the effect that our friends and relations are absent. As such, our baser life, in it's less than pointed harmony to such things, has no easy means to develop such. "In many ways, the bluntness of said point, made it so even a relatively long period of time was not enough for something to manifest: and thus upon the changing winds, we went." 
    <br>&emsp;I say, merrily, and in the root of joy, that seeing the world near and more or less far around you, brings me a calm delight and satiety. The sun rising, burning the later evening sky, this is simply enough. "Doth the King be further appreciated too, for his many more bounties."
    <br>&emsp;I lie though, with a sort of distastesfull passion, namely in the aversion to bad things happening, or any novel goods which occuring at all. We apply ourselves little, nor admitt faint or solid points. "Were a bit to crept inward, 'as if our pains and struggles are dug in to joyous path: for we so heartedly seek it, but at all other's expense."
    <br>&emsp;This seperation creates melechonlic imagery; whereby a precocious statement by the Prime Minister, or someone Youtube thumbnial, throughs me into a rigged state. "For I am not always so light and ample, to so heavily, yet elegantly respond. But it is the fact that our response is so course that bears the load: for we are either in a state of roughness, or calm eruption."
</div>
<div id=OurOwnDemise">
    The past as a key ingrediant in any resolve. For it would be nice if every epihany could proceed unchained, 'but from what grounds are we enlightened from, and still carying the weight of'.
    <br>&emsp;What seems most true, is that judgement was never, as it appeared, at our door. The folk around us were not interested in me, 'and only by our lack of harmony with them, did we spurr disdain'. Our dissociation was led by me, and our less than amiable ways. Not that we were abbrasive, but that we did not partake in the wits and ways of other people. This was so, primarily, by our response to the requirments around me. And, in our resolve to those, we felt little interest or validity in the ways of others. 
    <br>&emsp;It would have been nice if we could have seen the good around us; and do more of what we were supposed to do, and by that, been more upright to mingle with others. But, in the principled duty, we were nothing but average, 'or sufficient, as to feel free from worry and shame'. It was as if someone had a chain around me, and instead of handle it mightily, and by those encumbent strides, walk amidst others, we instead cowered, 'and did only what would be pleasing and enough for the rope around us'. 
    <br>&emsp;In our early years, we were acclimitized to friends by natural circumstance; in that, by familiarty, many orbited around. But, prior to our secondary years we moved, and from that point we could not look past or mingle, 'even if we were happy'. I don't recall being in turbelence at the time, and was more or less undrawn to the whims of others. "It was all gallantry and fluff." Indeed, our place in that did not need to be so, as if there was one soul place. But, at the time leading into highschool, our world felt very singular and defined. The peak of it held those properties, and so settled at the bottom, 'having fun with nerdy, unpopular kids'. 
    <br>&emsp;As we entered highschool, this disdain for fluff and esteem lingered with me. And despite having a few close friends, I never felt inclined to be apart of anything more. I don't feel too unique in this, 'but of others around me, they felt like co-workers, who I'd see in spot, then leave to go home'. "They were meantime people."
    <br>&emsp;As it happened, time went on, and by natural familiarity, we became more acquainted. We had a friend group, got a girlfriend, and things were alright. I acted to sharply though, 'as I would with closer friends, or family even'. This friend group of mine, 'who oddly enough, were not like those former, for if they were our bluntness would not mean so much'; but as it were, they were averse to me, and sent me away. "To my otherwise best friend too."
    <br>&emsp;The basic view of this, is that success breads satisfaction, 'as you feel in line with the neccessary path'. But if you find yourself overt to the things which give warmth around such amends,  then you may not be so keen or excited to oblige. And as it happened, the judgement around me regarding success, was more or less explicit. Not in magnitude but seriousness, 'as none, despite the world never falling, never felt or exclaimed passivity when it came to the elements of success'. 
    <br>&emsp;Our lack of place, in terms of friends and confidence, brought with it a sort  of groove, of which, in terms of comfort, was only filled with dear times and close friends. This did not procure a far view of the world though. A view which those surrounding judgements seemed to aim at. "Thus our youth felt aligned to such ends, but with the complexion of a chore, rather than meaningfull task." 
    <br>&emsp;And I felt this deeply through my teenage years, this sort of sense that, despite our talents and character, 'that we were in fact pathectic, or at least a little average and lame'. Despite our grasp for peace amidst judgement, 'whereby our wish was not so in line with the ends of such judgement, rather their present satiety', so were we also defensive, and by that cynical, 'as if we saw others success, or felt embarrased and ashamed, and thus exclaimed ourself (in angst and pride), to the futility of those around me.' 
    <br>&emsp;In this way, by that natural familiarity, we entered a group of friends, and relationship, by the mere coelescence of our circumstance, rather than, had it been earlier, an actual embellishment of what would procure such, and effectively. While our more or less inhereted state was one who's strucutre was a strong as our mozzying whims. "Which, encased with cynciism and defense, hoisted our social demise." 
    <br>&emsp;As the story goes, our consolation to such ways, was such, that of our friends and happiness, we amended to the fullest degree. But without solid candor or taste, we ignored, and in some sense beligered, those otherwise 'dutiful' judgements. "For which the road to philosophy lay."
</div>
<div id="TheLot">
    I look at artists and I see those who are completely themselves, individual, and expressive of such. Then I see those who are one of the lot, ordinate to custom and the whole. There are those who make the former's means for the latters ends; and then there are those who are purely liberal.
    <br>&emsp;This liberty, I'd state, is one where you are not yourself, but subject to nature and her judgements. You befriend ignornance, 'being so comfortable with her, that  you fear not her by your side: as the Gods do to the strongest men'.
    <br>&emsp;It's as if, in our chidlhood, we wonder and see, but upon those raising us, 'our view is flattened, so that we attend to the things near and common'. Those who are not so endited, rise high into the clouds, 'above all things beyond thesmelves, and of the norm'. There are those who look down but from higher up, 'as to succeed via creativity; as compared to those who create in order to be pleased'. While liberty is such, that from that basest of grounds,  'like a root in the soil', they stand, sturdily, and from that trunk blossom, 'whereby there solid grounds sprout, and from there blossom'. 
</div>
<div id="OfLiberty">
    So liberty has this ambiguous tone, as saying evokes senitments of freedom; when in fact, we are trying, in a fuller sense, to describe the open, flowing, sweet complexion. 
    <br>&emsp;We are talking about an abscence of concern; not so much that there are not problems, but that you are not overwhelmed by them. "At least, upon being pushed over, you get back up; or return at least to a steady standing." Another way of looking at this, is that by reason, we can accept things as fair, or at least natural, and thus just to expect. "For many of our concerns come from indignation, and thus complaimt."
    <br>&emsp;Surrounding this is the matter of wisdom, which beyond one's response in things, tailors our choices as to be driven towards the best of things, 'and not those which bring more concern, or dullness'. 
    <br>&emsp;In this, we say, that fortune is either made or risen to, 'in that, we make solid choices, or handle what's dealt to us'.
    <br>&emsp;In this abscence of worry and fear, along with indecence, we relish  the world around. For when our eye's aren't unerved, we see the leaves, bristling in the wind. Or when our ears are not so ladden with drama and doubt, the birds song can be heard through the morn. And when our time is not spent on dull affairs, or restless exertion, we may delight in the coming end, in which the sun sets, 'and all but the deepest blues linger in the sky'.
    <br>&emsp;There is so much to this. And, as one who finds good in writing or painting, 'so may we learn the grammar of the stars,' and by that, attune our mind to see her, hear her, 'and take her hand'. 
    <br>&emsp;This craft is the front end of liberty. As upon her liberated behind, lies the form in which her blossom's grow. "The route in which our heart sings: which, in said craft, marks how we practice."
    <br>&emsp;The grand insight though, is that as a child, we live in relatively liberal ways. We go outside, run around, enjoy things for the pure sake of fun. But in being raised, the deedes of the world are revealled to us. And generally, it is not the surpassing of these that we are reared to me, 'in that we'd be withtou concern', but that we should be eligble and sufficient in meeting them at all. As it were, upon one's oblige, so do they learn that craft. For a child, in their liberal grandeur, is more like a weightless whim, 'going here and there as they wish, but with little style or form to bolden their claim'. As we mature and become able, so do we angle the form of our joy, 'as not  to be so airy and basic, but rather full of matter and love'. Indeed, as one learns to speak and run, so do these natural faculties draw more light in; whereby, near and upon ouur younger condition, so is our delight more mature, 'in that our childish whims, weighed upon by common deed, rear their head to a more definite end'. Indeed, such an end, 'as seen by one aged and stated,' is the mard of a meaningfull life: as such a sight is born from one truly living: while a child is one whose life is being made for them. 
    <br>&emsp;I find then, that as our contentment with the deeds given become uneven, that our wishes and care for the world become extended. "Whereby we fear for those in war, of far off lands and places; or we more merrily seek the breads of Paris, or wilds of Bengal". This is no solid remark, 'and is better deemed a stain, upon our lapse of reason and or might'. 
    <br>&emsp;As such, I see that our own ease within obligate matters, is less defined or just in regards to children, 'but beyond our passion, not much else'. I may, rightly or in lust, seek to contribute, or be seen, but besides that, 'so is our solidity claimed'. For I can, with the git of moutnains and bookish delight, support myself in such, through means which I am more or less pleased, and reliable stated to. In terms of taxes and correspondence, I am all but nearly there. "Lacking only the words my dream's require." I am a manager, the breadmaker, the comfort, a stand, all in myself, 'in solitude or company'. 
    <br>&emsp;I am not always seen as someone who is such, and that be it of happiness, natural ends, impassioned deeds or glorious heights,that so are we unbecoming, and by that, in need of pressure and suggestion to do so. Whether we are near said voices or far away, it is our own solidity that keeps me about, 'and with pleasure listens, openly, nor with any fear of dismissal, nor integral doubt'. 
</div>
<div id="AtRisk">
    I am frightened, as our judgement of things is absent. Fairly, in reproach, or with the mingling of lazyness.
    <br>&emsp;Other people's judgement errode me then, 'as I have nothing to contend with'. In response, I accept that they are simpling speaking as so, and better communicate myself. In a way, all the reasons which I'd use to reject and or invalidate their argument, is a way in which our own is lacking: and thus, of our own speaking, we are reproached. For there is so much I don't know, nor do I wish to judge based on an incomplete picture. "Judging someone by their cover, is poor, because you do not know what's inside. The point being, that you don't know something entirely, and judging from so." It is not often that this is recognized, 'and one's gut is given esteem', rather the sense that there is more to something is not known. From that, I have given many things a deep and honest reflection. There are many communities in the world, and not much in terms of wordly action is done but by a select piece of them. But, indirectly does this inform me, 'as if the breadth of the world I know validates our abscence from current thought, as there is only more clearly a great deal I don't know'. Yet, this does not explain or fortell what will happen. It may suggest how things mean, 'as not even I believe, rightly, that the world will erupt'. But there may be conflict, and of a violent sort. This is sad, and once settled peacefully under the notion that such thing wouldn't happen at all. But just as there are combatants in the world else, so may it cross our door. My judgement is not such that me or my family are at risk, nor my community even. But of those who are, so doth the root of our contempt lay, 'for those instigating such belidgerence'.
    <br>&emsp;I have simply not given these matters any serious thought. I know to little, and am more broad in my source of meaning, and thus not spurred to contempt. Indeed, the feeling I get, is that people see the bad in entirety, 'as if their view of things is evily saturated', and thus their contempt lay. And, beyond our expectation of anything happening at all, 'where the bad is nearer than I'd imagine', and our otherwise steadfastness in the vastness in which strands of misfortune lay, that so are we, in our blankedness, comparably saturated by other's own inflammed views. "There deep colors quickly saturate me." 
    <br>&emsp;And indeed, all that has occured, is that in our fairness, our life, our place in the times, that we are not well of, or safe in ignorance. At least, of that which we are in fact afraid of, in the meagerest of work, or in desire of, 'for things far  off and way', that so are we acordingly unrooted and set, and by that, 'subject to the whims of our baser impurity; which, as they say, reflects the pangs of maturity, whereby you see the world in whole and finely, yet upon your lapse, so doth irriation lay'.
</div>
<div id="Unburdened">
    Liberty is the encumabcne of a condition, and doing so well enough, that your unburdened by it. Not that you are relieved, but without the weight of it: despite it still being there.
    <br>&emsp;From this, I see the coarse of all our lives. 
    <br>&emsp;For a government may see reason to fight, and by that encourage and or demand that citizens comply. This is a condition thus laid upon you, or one which you may be emtionally drawn to or simply interested in.
    <br>&emsp;But the point, is that you don't try and remove problems, rather treat them well so that they weigh on you not. Some things are indeed misfortunes, while other's are just. As I am right to work despite being at home, nor am I misfortuned to one day die. "I can't even think of a misfortune I have, merely things that are fairly asked of me."
    <br>&emsp;The goods of reason then, are those which come from this oblige to circumstance, as not to overt it, or remedy it's ware  upon you; but to instead fitfully amend, 'and feel the weight no longer'. To rise to it's task, and become light and mighty in your handle on it. 
    <br>&emsp;In regards to my life, so are we coming up to  work, then home. Masturbation is helpful, as there are pretty girls who I may be unerved around. But I don't care for porn, as it exasterbates my interests, and makes me more nervous. Father is leaving next week, and we'd be wise to lube up. We still have some, and we ought set up our bin, as to get the things we need.
    <br>&emsp;Laundry wise, we have jackets, sheets, blanets and clothes. In terms of showering, ought we do it.
</div>
<div id="Rubble">
    The form of our way, is such, that by some course, we sought peace over elation. But as this manifested, our aim became one in which the abscence of problems was sought, rather than overcumbing them. "The effect being one, in which we are without any opposition, but thus a little bare and in our lack of a response." 
    <br>&emsp;And so in our reflections, we stood on the grounds which so freely gazed at the stars; but by that, recognized the need for acquisition, to provide for this. For so long, this hill of freedom was sought, 'with hopes that all requirments were gone'. Yet some unhdoutbedly stayed.
    <br>&emsp;I think of our childhood, and our approach into youth and all it's contention. In such times, be it young or old, we had deeds to meet, and obligations at that. Some felt unneccessary, other's fair. But so did the increasing pleas for things beyond our post, leave me unnerved with such present, but not either drawn or convinced of such beyond. 
    <br>&emsp;Our story is so, that of our cares, so were they concentrated on the sprouts of our present, 'and our dedication to all that cultaivted that'. We steared away from the fears and desires ahead, and sought all the good that came from being rightly present. 
    <br>&emsp;The truth though, is that less there was a total abscence of demand, then the meager amount you had saw us buckle under our 'liberal press'. Which is to say, that we  lacked any good that came with the benefits and or commradery of future regards. And in our present stake, so were blossomed, but without much of a frame against actual demands. Indeed, we obliged to such deeds, 'but also fortified our liberty, or present being'. 
    <br>&emsp;There is this element of craft, or defintiion rather, in which, the whole and shining world seen from our point of liberty, needs a sort of hilt, or at least foundation to stand on. And this was so, for based on the good we had, and the common deeds to get it, the meager amount of this could not suffice for the loose joys of our liberty. In pure abscence, 'as one experiences on  a weekend, or over the summer', such joys are fufulling. But once outward regards come to be, such enjoyments deflate. And so giving some form and craft to such things, prevents the common deeds of the world from weighing you down. 
    <br>&emsp;My adolescence was very much about raising the height of our joy, and finding worth in doing so. "Even at the cost of everything else." My road to  adulthood though, was in the accepetance of our place in life, as a person, a man, a son, brother, friend. And as such, we could not live as though our liberty would be uncontended, 'or withouth the whiffs of demand'. Indeed, at the beginning of this stage, I found much console in this, as I saw the joy that could occur around our deeds as sufficient. "Yet our deeds felt like things to run from; be it by our own ware, or the feeling of shame by others." It never could be enough, even though I felt it so.
    <br>&emsp;Moving forward, we tried to deal with such matters; but to an end which ultiamtely accepted them as being so. "And nothing but for our dreams to wonder about, in ceasing." As such, we did find our place in a motion which was right and relatively stable; and one which we were more free to accept. As such, we held those initial sentiments of form and definition, 'as to give the joy surrounding our condition a means for volume and constance'. But via cirucmstance, we were granted entry into a weightless scenario, and  left to our whims and ways. 
    <br>&emsp;The oddity in life though, is that even without employment, you still have the wares of your health and natural state. From this, I always felt that it was a remark of other's scorn, that I could not relieve myself as I would under a clear condition, but in this liberal case. While I was up north though, I did not accept or begrieve such a notion. As despite feeling the wish for it, I ultimately accepted that the happiness we cared for would not come about through such permission. "That even without judgement, we still ough behave ourselves." But the reality, was that we were admirably flourishing in a place that needed me not to. Indeed, had we been more occupied, than our firmer want of comfort and relief would be more fitting with the demands of our scenario. But we ultimately choose to retain our lack of condition, and live as the happiness required of that needed. For we were not pleased to be absent of worry and time, but otherwise soft and idle. Nor, at the time, did we wish for invovlement or promising activity. I simply choose to live as the form of a non-conditioned happiness stated.
    <br>&emsp;Practically, this was never as easy to commiserate. As you could only do so much; nor was our environment free from pokes and prods. "And indeed, our adolescent dreams came in the form of that which would heighten such freedoms: to make them preferably so."
</div>
<div id="DearRegards">
    At some point I will confer about our duties, and the meager means to meet them. I may consider the rules and custom which erect them, or pose them as a demand, or simply worthwhile, but more or less, I am in tune with such things, and need more remarks about our amends, and how we'll effectively demonstrate those.
    <br>&emsp;But, seeing as that moment is not here, and we are thus below the weight of lacking such, I will remark on those sights which my 'flatter state'  is holding onto. "For, like passion, my delights, upon my means to be with them, slip into the realm of definition: where I try and hold principled attention, since our actual prescence to them is seperate: I try and hold myself there, for they are so dear, 'and I hate to seem them go', and with all might, bear our credulous regard, 'for in moments where the abyss is calling, I fight to prevent them becoming such memory'."
    <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst this is our physical study. The issue of light has pressed me for some time, as remarking on our senses and impression,  and by that, our view of the composite world, falls short of what it could be, in confidence and like, when our means to illustrate light, heat, their motions, and otherwise form, is either absent, 'or but a basic term, rather than vibrant concept'. "One ought know the fish and places of a reef, rather than it merely being one: for you can only then say so little."
    <br>&emsp;Adjacent to this is emperical methodology, namely, in spectroscpoy, carbon dating and other modes in which particles are observed. This is valued on our natural basis, 'as we can better claim the soul of the world, if, by such measurments, we can thus, in it's constitution, claim'. But similar to composition, in that you ought know more than a basic term, so ought you know more than the prescence of something, 'that your knowledge amounts to knowing that something is there'. This awareness is but the crust of learning, as you ought know how such things are known to be there. For it is one thing to say the earth is however old, and another as to why, and thus how: by that, we may actually understand what the earth being so old means, as the mark that tells us so --as seen through instruments-- tells us also about the object at hand.
    <br>&emsp;Lastly, on the finer things, is the mark of a cloud, or mountain. This is so, that we look at Golden Ears, and see it in whole; but we also see that one of its peaks is called Blandshand, the other the Needle. But I do not know what they are, 'as if, Golden Ears the thing or place, had some feature, like snow even'; yet I could not say what such feature was, 'like a scratch or tatoo on someone's arm'. How ought I even state the heart of the mountain. Clouds are no different, in their flat expanse or roaring tuffs. There's even varied kinds of puff, be it the rising flat heads, or bundled rolls. These need better names, 'for I wish to say more than it is nice and cloudy out'. As all days are different, and the suns rays even cast differently on the land around. I'd like to even see that, in the varied hues, but particularly, of what is shined on.
    <br>&emsp;I'll talk a bit of leisure too, as I find, in our applied work, or that of duty, that we always come back to games and watching. And, albeit fine and plenty, there are moments where the old stuff feesl a bit to so; or, in a slower state, we have less interest, 'and need something new, or at least something to bide our time'. Game wise, Fallout and Red Dead come to mind. We've just finished God of War and are working through Ragnorak, and there is Avowed and Indiana Jones, but, freely, and with more breadth, there is Fallout, and its starting adventure, full of scavenging and fun, and Red Dead, that, despite requiring mods, is full of wilderness exploration, hunting, bounties, quests, and colorfull scenery. Civ remains fun, and in understanding the parts of the ages, your civ and strategy, there remains much fun. Trying new things comes when you are in the groove of the game, 'as you see the mould, but through cirucmstance orient that'. The natural wonder battle seems a perfect fit for Spain, and I am full of delight at our coming Maurya game; and even a combat one, with Rome, or Persia. 
    <br>&emsp;Show wise, I am right in the heart of fall allies. We are going through the latter part of our Inca game, and there is much to overhear while doing so. And I just can't help but feel nice, in terms of gaming to, that our pace of life is both right and forward, 'and thus, of what we see afar, so are we free and happy to meet, and thus anticipate: which gives much rest now'.

<div id="MereMemory">
    To continue this line of thought, I see, that we are in fear of other's judgement; and when we see them reading or listening to certain people, we think, 'oh, well their going to be what said judgements are based on'. 
    <br>&emsp;Another thing, is that in our own way, suscipion, or supposition rather, is a leading line of inquiry; and one, which repeatedly details the world. Only, if we are only with such sucipsion, and not actual possessed by what we figured, then we may feel defensve of what other's have presumably found. "As our sights are elsewhere, yet, we have no confidence or indifference from getting there."
    <br>&emsp;By that, I see, that akin to our physical sights, and geopgrhical too, that the history of our world is even more lost. For we have much sight, but little matter to fill it in. Namely, in the division of our communites and people, and how this relates to the lineage of social organization; and the otherwise sensible regards of varied domains. I see this in all walks of life, that the past is too blurrily known; which is to say, that in principle, we can see how it's come, and how the present is merely a current state of that. Then, the way it actualy is, which the past can give much insight to, as some far off case, or the present.

<div id="FreeMoving">
    There is an interest in all of us, to see, be seen, and by that, connect, and through that, be trusted.
    <br>&emsp;But earning this is no small task; as our natural keeness for this can see us rushing headlong, or at least yearning prior to entry; making the approach a hasty one.
    <br>&emsp;What I see, is that we need only be ourself, and offer that for whatever corresponding return.
    <br>&emsp;I see then a girl, whose name is Vienna; and indeed, she feels like a whim of the past. Only, I can see, as grounded as I'd been with Simron, but with a sort of reproach to our insatiety, that we are oppertune for one another. I won't compare myself to other's, but I can say, by the very fact that she likes movies, and in telling me so, was interested in whether I did, and that she makes Oragami, 'for which I can only propose is a reflection of similar interests', that because of this, I feel fair and drawn to give my own cares, be it in reading, writing, the clouds; and the almighty reverence for film score, 'but the all too consistent retreat from letting such be known': to her I'd share.
    <br>&emsp;But this is not so mucb about her being this grand persona, of which we are so enambered with and finally in sight of. She is simply one, who by our openeness and liberty, and with delight to share. And of all things comfort and sex, ought these been seen like meals, in that, of things good and worth sharing, 'ought you primarily wish to share a meal, and be together as that'.
    <br>&emsp;The cause of this inquiry is such to color our humility and temper, 'for we do wish for dessert'. 
    <br>&emsp;I am etched with a manner then that I have been embellished with in the past; namely, that weary pitch towards written definition. Truly, this may, and surely has, gone to far. But, I see, that the main component of that harsher side, is one where the motions are guided by a fear and or retreat from abscence; and the according effect of forcing work. While the component of the finer side, is one where the interest at hand is a fair one, 'and as one near and lifted by the clouds may wish to better see them, so do we in our current strides wish to take them fully'. The difference being, that we are not simply training our calves so we may run, rather due to nature's pull on me, 'and our care for the scenery around', so do we wish to marble those otherwise driven strides. "For we are in either case forthgone, and right thus to excell more."
    <br>&emsp;As such, we will let our likes wander, 'as they are free to be, and as such, hold nothing but their nature, as guided by the wind'.
    <br>&emsp;To round this off, I will state the complexion of liberty; a sentiment which has been long trailing behind me. As we have come from the land north, and settled in the meadows once called home. But as I see this, in all fortune and propiety, that such calmness and joy is not something worth the pretense of leaving for somewhere else; nor fearing that others may wish you to, or repent while you stay. Said folk around may have their own grit and whim, but it is more common than not for them to express their withdrawal of judgement; at least when it comes to the matters in which we've been irksome about before.
    <br>&emsp;As such, I compare this day to the one's I had as a kid, whereupon our chores being done we went outside, and with the sticks and yard we had, played. Only through age and a begudged response, did I ever feel like leaving. "As if there would not be troble outside our coming door." Relating this to the present, we are indeed more than a child, as we have more than chores which behold us. But equal in that, may we, and, as perhaps a release from pretense, are we given permission, if not very little evidence of judgement being present, as regards our proper treatment of our obligations; and thus sprouting success. And it need not be said that, like our time as a child, our mature response, albeit similar in form, is one in which the fruits match the trunk and deed. "To some extent, as a thinking man, doth the world and her wonder lay: of which, in said field we play." For years mind you I could not help but be drug and irrate about the brambles and stone in such meadow; whereby our weary strides came to be. Now though, despite the grass stretching still as far as the eye can see, am I more near and present to green infront of me. Of which our point of liberty is founded.
