        Forewardly, I say that things fit the measure; what is the measure though? I begin astutely, on the common ground of something good; this does not say what the value is, but that which and whatever they are, our aim is to properly and regularly meet that. Moreso, and as an admittance (for ignorance's sake), am I willing to say that further than that, I claim not to know. I suspect that we are clearly an intellect, one of which that inquires and realizes that they are A) one, and B) helmed through the body, to which they bring agency. In that, I firmly say, that the fullest and roundest aims that this mean can get, are enough and satisfactory to me, for I am one, the intellect.
        <br>&emsp;What I can say most clearly, is that my life is fine and we are free. Nothing can impair me, for nothing is prompt to be taken, possibly, when it comes to what I seek. "My faculties and reason are the tools of my heart, stretching me further as I settle into our day." These things can be dull or sharp, but they will never be taken away. "Even in prison, I can think and be, relishing our very interest and inquiry; moreso, using our gift of strength and grit, can I remain happy that we are fine and stable, no matter what comes our way: for we know we end the same."
        </div>
        <div id="aman">
        I wish to be generous: it is where I am living the most. There are requirements though, in both ground and ability — so we may contribute. Our motivation then rests on the balance between the satisfaction of an abundant expression, and the strategy to acquire the means of doing so. Foremost, would I accept the fact that it is us in which we’re seeking; not infamy and fame, no, rather a fortune which is simple and enough, wherein the time offered is simply industrious and well. Those terms (within that aim) might be what's worth addressing. Firstly is being prolific, which merely suggests your efforts are consistent and abundant; furthermore, would industry describe pure genius and design, creating something new whilst being resourceful in the way you generate its scope. Lastly is collaboration, which widens the floor in which you dance and increases the amount of hands to hold; the result here being the amount of substance offered in total, as each and all are contributing. On this latter lies a principle of fortune: if you have put enough time and effort in, than more is easily welcomed. This is the case since efficiencys and niche efforts have a rooted place to add too, compared to being the root themselves. "As if you were adding the finishing pages to your book, compared to starting from nothing."
        <br>&emsp;This note is worth considering in terms of our development. When it comes to us, our dignity and helmsmanship carry us in a regular way; from doing so, we stand firm and tall, able to be and thrive individually. If you imagined a tent being pitched, consider the grip of its tip being pulled indefinitely; consider the base of the tent and its sides, and whether or not the width would shorten or increase. The accessibility of various levels of interest could be assigned a need of effort(by the user) and room for interaction(the fortune present). On the former, we could say that niche efforts are placed higher than baser ones; for example, writing is a bedrock activity whereas sculpting is much more unique. In other words, the model here is reminiscent of a cone. The width reflects the ease by which you do things, and the height reflects the complexity of the project. As another example then, would intricate dance sit further above, as its complexity was to a higher degree than simply reading. And even though the efforts here were of a higher kind, the fortune required for it to have a working place, need be higher as well. Whereas writing, study, leisure and baser fun, can be had in any circumstance or time — as they are easy to get going - while intricate performances or specialty practices need more flexibility and contribution to reach a comparable state of progress. "It is easier to get halfway through a book than it is to complete half a ballet."
        <br>&emsp;Here, the dynamic of maturity avails. Simply, the situation proceeds like this. If you are tall and true, the world will be enough, for two reasons. Being sound allows for an impression of the world richer and equally inspiring; secondly, the accessibility of treating higher things(from being taller, or mature) allows for an increased involvement and treatment onto that which you see- wherein all despair and dullness is flattened. Two points regarding expression and its demands can be made. First, reflects the basic need for maturity, that is the height of oneself, where being so sees those generous claims as your treat. The problem arises though if and whenever you deflate and descend into the realm of the second issue. This dynamic can more or less be summarized into ‘the amount in which we are living, along with what we have to do so’. This is where friendship and fellows or comrades of similar interests come into play. If you have 4 or 5 people who work together, contributing towards a body of work composed of individual and collaborative efforts, then the overall substance becomes relatively large; consequently, there is room and resources to invite further and more particular efforts. This, in contrast to our solo efforts, is as such in this simple way. You live at 95, treated to the ripest fruits of writing and craft, while meddling in and taming the works of film and development; as a group though, you may be riding 75 with 5 others, the result being work that isn’t great but more abundant, allowing for consistent contributions to be made; moreso, does this body of work encourage that principle of substance, solidifying the current efforts into something sturdy and inviting, wherein other projects and craft become more accessible, as well as furthering the draw of other workers and patrons. "As in finance, is it easier to add five dollars to ten, than it is to one."
        <br>&emsp;The concerns here are in both of two ways. On the first example, you have the issue of substance, as you are solely you; on the second is the concern of strength in your work. I will discuss the former. Being mature matches the peak of your time with the quality of work; its design and care amounts to something original and pure, satisfying too. However the substance does not accrue and shine in such an obvious way. One reason is that the path of maturity, initially at least, does not see you out and about in a social way; generally, you are at home and within yourself, and this does not put your effort clearly on display. Secondly, is the nature by which you would work, and what could be shared and shown; considering the abundance of group work, the particular efforts of solo work may seem smaller in size, and to hand crafted to be set for a wide display. The issue lies in the demand of your attention, and how the niche and smaller things have less room for complete dedication — compared to the baser things in writing, for example. In effect, the great things you do as a mature person are in the nature of inquiry and development, compared to something grand and obvious of which requires equal dedication but the room in which someone on their own may be lacking. Consequently, those who seek a more sound and rooted life, can struggle with the mingling of proper generosity, in the good in it wholeheartedly, alongside the place where it is actually seen and found. The mature person holds himself to the strongest of efforts despite these concerns, consistent through greatness and reflection, able and hopeful to reach a point where more wood is added to the fire: “he is merely kindling though.”
        <br>&emsp;On the second of those former issues, is in regards to the vector of joy. Joy, is simply the metric for living. It is not truly life when actions are restricted, rather when they are open and accepted. This why for example, virtue in character conquers all of time, for even in dire states, courage and fortitude (to name a few), take misfortune and make it acceptable and deliberate; in cultivating the proper response to our condition, we can helm ourselves prominently, trusting that we can but, equally and to the point, that we should. In that case at least, would our response be welcomed — as we were positive to its necessity. Anyway, when it comes to the way we spend our time, it is best spent in a way where, on mass, the joy(so to speak) is the highest possible. In my estimation then, this requires the stance of us and the aim of things which draw us to be involved, and thus with joy. No one seeks trouble, but if we truly wish to live lavishly and flourishly, then our interests and aim ought be for activities that truly are positive, in that we can throw ourselves into them without much effort or fuss — for they are the ones which draw us the most.
        <br>&emsp;The distinction then of maturity and group efforts is in the demand of those working. On maturity, this stance sets itself on the strength required to partake in the bedrock of things: the inquiry of god and matter, reflections of death and our lives. These interests permeate throughout other cares, but are helmed and initiated only by your heart and ability. In comparison, a group levels the way, allowing for general interest to be the craft: photography, performance, discussion, analysis. These efforts are for those fortunate enough to do them, for they are personally done amidst the pillars of work past done — in which these particular efforts can rest. It is worth noting strictly, that the limit of being alone or being in a group, is not bent in a way that either explicitly holds to. It is merely the case that one who is alone, will rely on and repair themselves moreso than is required in the group, and those in the group will have less need or demand to be so helmed. The consequence is seen in contrast of the two: to those mature, their work will be baser and less substantial(and thus more difficult to share), whereas the group will do more things, interesting ones at that, but be less refined and pure than those who are great.
        <br>&emsp;The point then, is that neither the individual or the group need lack the cares of each other. A mature man can still ready their craft, in a way in which it is substantial; moreso, can they make sturdy ground besides this, seeking harmony with provision and their rooted cares, and, in addition and continuously, keep active and open to the interests of other individuals, allowing for the potential to form a trio or pair. In a similar way, the group can still hold themselves to a higher standard, being more individual about their fortuned efforts. If they truly cared about being generous, then the bedrock of things plus the reverence for inquiry, can see truer and sounder impressions and aims for their efforts, born out and demonstrated through their fortune of the group — and thus their substance.
        <br>&emsp;I feel as though, to bring this all together, that a balance and care for each side of the coin is what’s worth regarding. Your comfort zone and fallibility in the quest for maturity should not heed you from any attention towards furthering the engines and working hands. Hold yourself to the highest standard, and relish the void of an unexamined life, but don’t hesitate to encourage and align yourself with select others — who opportunely may feel the same. Moreso, to actually cherish the route you’ve chosen in the first place and trust those aims and their kind of way; doing so will make you more available to others, as you are still in fact producing by yourself. Even if this steady state is your place, and you are in fact on your own, those prior reasons ought to keep promises in front of you — which will hopefully remove the discouragement of lackluster fortune. Be reminded though, that a fearful response to this is not correct. “Do not be looking for professional or traditional appeasement, if artistry, industry, and maturity pulls your gaze.” If being helmed through maturity and her gain is what you look towards, and is where your constitution is kept, merely stay confident about the rewards that will come, through being yourself and in response from others. “Running away to more comforting pastures, will only see you fail at both.” Building on that in regards to the group, I would say that it is enough if you see what the mature man does, only that you are separate in the wares that you have to materialize the interest. It is the case that those who find themselves in companies and teams, may not have the aim of joy and well being; I don’t suspect though that their efforts will bring them to any other place, seeing as good living eventually refines rough edges. In more ways than not then, a member or the whole team, can bring themselves further by simply recognizing that they have good fortune: wherein the point in which it is for will become more clear, and consequently draw one and all's attention to that.
        </div>
        <div id="prominence">
        I will add something to the aim of maturity. Simply said(as I am reiterating), maturity is the expression of a helmed self. The root of this is the awareness of that self, along with the resolve to care and treat it. Being the unit and vector for measurement, our mind and its mixtures turn in on themselves, noticing whether they are well fitted or not. "It is the very act of being conscious, that paves the eventual way for recognition that one is, and thus, bearing one's self as if that were the medium." The world does act on us, but its treatment is discerned, conditioned, and responded through the conscious. It is merely an internally bound system. Beyond further complexities of this motion, we can purely say that the proper helming of this address is the mark of maturity. "To carry one’s self, as a proper one through the world, regular and reverent."
        <br>&emsp;Now, I bring this up for the concern of this way and what it brings. It is through this summary of the mind, that an agent is the measure. The quality and state of the being is impressed on and altered by the world to the point of 'you as the measure, not the world'. Following this, with the image of a single man let's say, you could describe his state as being well and rounded, narrow or of width, plump with satisfaction or boring and stiff. This state of the unit is what I would like to expound on. It is the case of maturity, that the agent is incessant to their nature. They deal with that wholeheartedly and through, caring little for how others are, or the world to. The reason, is that their interaction is spent generously in an expressive state; all they can do that interferes with others is all that comes from them; knowing this, they treat themselves with the utmost attention and care, so an offer of purity and abundance can be made.
        <br>&emsp;Accepting this, we must consider the position of one who is mature. The life of doing so is a sort of industry in its own right. As the automotive or service industries have their own customs and ambition, so will the mature man have. Not only will he trust in his make, but he will also address the fact that he has come from not. In retrospect, an understanding of the universe as his lineage may seep deep enough into him so he can see that there is no need for concession or reticence - or rather a fear of missing out from opposing gains. In reaching that point though(where all is known) the man who we could describe as 'maturing', will increasingly reflect on the claims that he's made, but admit the fragility in which they are held. Only when a completely sound mantra(so to speak) is known, can he relax his attention; only when he can carry himself by his own weight, will we say his nature is rounded and set: Until then, his nature must be tended. The progress in reaching this becomes unquestionably easier. As you proceed, you shed your rust and ambition, settling into a proper coat that is bathed in congruence and adjustment. This arrangement is an easy one at its core, despite any initial misgivings - as you may have bolted skin to shed that needs doing so. "Who though, would falter or hide from the gains of simply being themselves? and where is the real difficulty in working for that?"
        <br>&emsp;Reaching the stage in which you are mature then is definitively a state of prominence, rather than one which is absolute. A nature of something reflects what it does. In our case at least, those actions are rooted in the response we have to the environment. The nature of one who is beyond recognition is strictly the place of complete maturity. "Your place in the world, when met without ease or care, yet a gain of smooth and consistent experience is regular, then you can say that you are beyond a nature: you purely be."
        </div>
        <div id="ambition">
        I am being generous thoroughly but my effort is ill-prepared. I would describe this as one who is lacking occupation and aims for some setting ahead. Compared to that, you would normally be congruent to work's demands, appreciative of any time in waiting. In addition, I would say that a feeling of indifference to how that mean time is spent is common, for your interests are relative to the work ahead. Going home or taking a break is neutral in the precedent of this free time; working time and your profession are what require your attention, while the rest can be of comfort or in bed. It seems simply put, that your time has no bearing outside your primary venture, and thus, you are satisfied with doing nothing. In contrast to this, is one who lives immediately, but sees little far ahead. By this, I mean one who is mature and bound, seeking a prudent as well as industrious life. Here, they are reciprocal to all things, treating them in response to their own interest and craft. This way of life is different from those of occupation, in that they seek no stronger position or place, whereas those who are professional seek things of a more open and comforting kind. Effectively, the former lives as if they are already made, hearing and seeing the world in front of themselves and tributing it now. The latter however, put their head down, suspend wholesome ambition, and settle onto the track of future gain. This course though is not one that eventually prevails into a greater kind of maturity and its reward; instead, they're treated to the promise of more things, the ease from aligning and succeeding in their development, and the satisfaction when wealth comes. The issue with this latter is that it involves very little doing. It is ironic that the path here is suspectedly more enjoyable than the place they reach, and moreso do they wish there was still somewhere else to go once they have reached there - for upon reaching that end, they are unsettled by their new lack of ambition.
        <br>&emsp;The resolve here is one that lacks maturity in the success of their aim, but rests similarly to those who are mature, in that each is really focused on what they are doing. To this one who is occupied, their interest and care is spent actively and pleasingly; the difference is that it is driven by wealth and future gains. The ignorance is purely the fact that once those motivations are met, more will need to take its place. Nothing is ever worth the promise besides the draw it places on you, helming you to act substantially, of which is the truest gain. The mature person sees this, reverently. They poise themselves into this kind of conduct, ignoring the faulty promises, but actually addressing and confiding in the prominence of good there is in actual living. They define what this means as joy, measures the stretch of experiencing it as being generous, and deliberately aims for the abundance of this claim so that by their end a good amount of full living will have been gained. "Which they can reflect on happily, in knowing that they've lived."
        </div>
        <div id="onwork">
        I have made a grand distinction, though, I may not be able to define it. It starts a like this. Work is meant to seep provisions. These are proceeds towards your claim, the gain of which is in how you spend your time. The metric of that use is joy; we’ll say merely, that this reflects where you live the most. Joy then, is the demand for those who are living; moreso does it presume that your wish is to do so well.
        <br>&emsp;Something I truly believe and have fully experienced is that this desire needs very little to proceed; not only do the demands of effort require little more than the wisdom of your choices, but, moreso and my point, that the vessel and case for things that draw you to aspire -in your industry and production- are not only abundant but limited in what you really need. What we are doing, is simply creating something from nothing by throwing ourselves in -to something thought of and designed. “Where we are inspired is through all that surrounds us. That world and its glory is what we see and define; this fashions a mold for our tribute, wherein we earn the reward of full engagement.” The sum of this accounts for how much we’ve lived.
        <br>&emsp;Life pulls us though and regularly brings us out of line with this sort of path. Especially, is this the case through misfortune. “As those in peril have little room to consider their wellness.” For example though, I say quite confidently that even if you were in a dungeon, dripping with blood, dread and grit, still could you mend this by your nature to inquire. For you could address that there still sat goodness around, or simply the fact that by these more horrid means or not, you were still mortal. By remedying ourselves against those scenarios, or contrary traits for that matter, so to can we remain with our heads up high and placed towards the gain of living. “Or least can we remember the beauty elsewhere in the world, which serves even those who are now blinded.” As it stands, our aim of joy and abundance will come as long as we can act on the good that we see. In terms of what we have, this is what can be corroded, by those troubles or ignorant stupidity. If we are well kept, and otherwise placed away from the latter, then so too will our aims be set towards that vibrancy and color. And remember, that in any place you can conspire against the forces of nature, to see her as beauty and love. “No matter the trouble she throws at us, so to can we be true to what she is in the way of.” In keeping that direction in mind, can we persevere past her bindings, or avoid them by setting ourselves outside more common troubles. Still, we must find a basic agreement with her, as to align ourselves to be congruent and efficient amidst the tempests of her darker side. “It is the ill wisdom of folks which drowns them amidst nature and her task, as they are ignorant to both her ways, and thus what she asks. Consequently, we bear neither any confidence of right approach, or the actual claim.” If our choice is otherwise effective, then so will our industry and creativity flourish. “Wherein life and joy is our gain.”
        </div>
        <div id="joy">
        Let us clarify our life position; it goes as follows. We are trying to live well, and this means being generous. This is best described as involvement in activity and craft, prolifically and industriously. On the former, this we'll regard as an abundance in your effort; to the latter, an ingenuity in the way you spend your time. The reason these attributes are in line with living well is in the bedrock of contribution. Being generous, or rather the stream of contribution, merely reflects the act of enjoyment.
        <br>&emsp;Joy is the measure of your involvement, rooted in the ease and relishment of the experience. Enjoyment is the sum of a duration, and in effect, is generous when the effort is aimed at 'some' thing and through 'some' craft. "The things that draw us the most are those which interest us, pulling us with ease, to which we happily contribute." Living well then, is defined as the amount of generosity, or enjoyment, that is stacked throughout your life.
        <br>&emsp;My feeling is that in doing so, you will have lived the right life, for it was one set and deliberate towards the aim of living. This aim then, is fully met when you are consistent in the experience that increases the sum of joy. In that, it is the regularity of your contribution that marks the riches of this time.
        <br>&emsp;That contribution is best spent and largely so, when it is prolific and industrious. For example, if you love to paint, then the abundance of strokes and creative employment marks the prolific trait within the activity. If you love literature and are keen on making a reference, then the ingenious and resourceful design in arranging and conveying the bounty of information that has your eye, reflects the industry in your effort.
        <br>&emsp;It is also worth noting the frequency and thus gain of these kinds of efforts. If contribution is marked in size through the abundance of expression, and creativity in design, this we'll say is the highest measure. Similar though, to a marathon run once in a while, the effects of generosity eventually wain as your contribution fails. "It does not matter how much income you make if your spending remains and the additions fail." Your life is forever when it comes to you. The demand then for this life to be living is in the consistency of the gains that fill it. It is true that if you have a wonderful stretch of time, even a lacking will be held up from the radiance that followed. That light will begin to fade though, as will the consequences of non-living come into place. However, seeing as this sort of color isn't too appealing, our natural draw from the prior state of saturation will surely call out as a point to return to. "If the lacking prevails otherwise, so will your time feel the same."

        <div id="generosity">
        The paramount line of our life is contribution. I strictly mean where you are generous with your time: there you are living. "living the most then can be regarded as the reach of your generosity." Being generous can be tough though. A dilemma is caused though on whether or not this should be the case. On one hand, you can be successful and leveled in your way, allowing you to work more. On the other hand, you may gain little in terms of stability from your efforts, relying on the satisfaction your generosity gives in order to make provisional efforts worthwhile. I think that something should be clarified in order to understand this dynamic. Simply, your work is not meant to produce anything more than the joy and room to do so. There's this crass integrity which says that audiences and impact make the effort worthwhile - for it generates more satisfaction. I find this is folly. If we really are interested in being generous, then we will seek the rewards that give us that.
        <br>&emsp;Something to distinguish then is the nature of the work you do and what warrants it. It is the case that a personal vocation rests in all of us, of which we can privately and happily do. We may have alternative interests and crafts that draw us outside this but feel warranted only by the collaboration and exposure to others. Photography is a great example for me. At its core, it isn't something I would be satisfied in doing personally; perhaps by its purely visual nature it is something that gravitates towards sharing, but it simply isn't something I would do on my own. I would like to do it however, but here our point is contained. Everyone who wishes to be industrious and prolific seeks a reason to do so. Whether it is the involvement of others who will see or simple freedoms that you have gained, allowing you to be irreverent to the impact. This line is what we are trying to understand. As an artist, my vocation is writing, design, and study. These molds us through the world as me: no one knows though. I don't seek their attention for my own need - I am very satisfied currently. It is merely the confusion between things I would do if I had the time, and my expectation that what I do and who I am, primarily, will earn me that necessarily.
        <br>&emsp;Something to clarify is the notion of good things and their expectations. It isn't the case that appreciation and subsidy ought not to be sought from your efforts; it's just the case that your great developments don't demand or guarantee a spotlight and reward. This is the problem and thing to extinguish. Our effort is not barred from its substance, but the reward is not a centering on you. It is quite possible, acceptable at least, that the greatest thing earns little notoriety. My resolve though is to recognize what being notable is for. I wish to be generous and industrious. On the latter, this describes efforts that are rooted in collaboration and being prolific. The freedom required to do so is where the notoriety is mixed in, as if it will provide. And it is not as if it wouldn't, but is it so easy to acquire? I would say no. Moreso, I would call it unnecessary. Pointedly, the line is from us. The production along this way is barred simply by the limit of our substance, preventing us from adding more. My question then is where you would have enough to add something considerable. It may not be the means in which you seek, but rather the results of steady use from a stronger team, or self. If there were a group contributing, then it could reach a size where its foundation was worth solidifying, wherein you could add to it. I think this is the way, compared to starlight intentions.
        <br>&emsp;I concede proudly to the little I need to proceed to a lot, but I sink a little in my composure at the notion of further solitude. I have some trust in the proliferation of our efforts to meet that threshold, along with the natural draw of others to join our trajectory and add to the construction - be it from online exposure or personal invitation(from work let's say). I simply am trying to understand the place for my ambition in producing something spectacular, but avoiding the concern and draw of a profit or reward. At heart, I believe the motivation lies in the softness of your core, in which you shift around a little too awkwardly and see the road as a struggle because it is personal, and you feel off. "As I am beginning to find, being steady with this will make lift your hopes and please you, in the spot your in right now; as such engagement usually amounts to adding more steps. And is that not what is satisfying?"
        </div>
        <div id="positivity">
        If being happy is truly the meaning of our lives, what does it exactly mean? The reason I ask is that aspiration can dread one into feeling like their current happiness, or sought-after satisfaction is not enough. I would say definitively that things don’t make the mold; they are what fit the measure. Moreso, would I relish that metric, and say it was to be a flourishing, regularly. Reaching for that then fully and to its heart permits the removal of remission from its settlement and victory. “Insisting on something other to be sought is not necessary.”
        <br>&emsp;I really don’t think we have much more than the time on our hand and its interests to enjoy. Nourishing that, as to draw yourself into and towards those things which compel you to contribute, prompts the question of whether these things are not enough for living to be claimed. The question for a mature one, is to the nature of these interests, and their presence within the strength of your craft; if you are able to contribute more, and into trails of higher interest, should more base ones which are exciting and tumultuous be regretful outside of their obtainment? I think harshly not. If the measure truly is a worthwhile experience, then we must rest on the laurels of things having their place and time with respect to those wholesome ways.
        <br>&emsp;If our values are of a kind, then the real question is whether or not they are misplaced - or mistaken rather. Where I begin with that consideration, is the principle of positivity; it says that ‘regardless of one’s claim, be it from theology, sadism, industry, drunkenness or fame, the goal and thus aim, is at least the gain of a measure which is positive’. My feeling is that the real question for reason and philosophy is what then is most positive. On one side, whatever it is would in fact command us to act in an appropriately astute way. This gives merit to the fact that stealing, for example, is no good in itself, and is thus not a demand of any good aim. The difficulty though is in determining why it is deemed poor before we have the end in mind. “As I have discovered, those criteria, or determinants of good rather, must come from assessing who we are and what we wish to be. Then, all actions and goals can administer themselves with respect to that.”
        </div>
        <div id="demands">
        The world cries out in response to my prompt, to be treated in a certain way or kind. What I receive is the price. Considering what the request is that I place, the demands by that which giveth is relatively small. So much so, that I have begun to describe each and nearly every post as 'accommodations'. Clearly speaking, I say provisions (and your needs thus) are meant for you to live. The offer then of what provides is simply to do that: to give the ground for you to enjoy. I regard those efforts as accommodative, as however varied they are, their mean is toward a living which is universal. "From thievery or business, I seek freedom and joy."
        <br>&emsp;I seek joy and gratitude, consistently and true. This is the aim of all posts: and they are all equal at giving so. That living though is what is hard to define. Through the theory of hunch, only so much can be known; yet I imagine that regardless of our uncertainty to how things are, we can at least grapple with and parse what there is - whether or not we know what it means. I see at some point a total understanding of our very reflection as we become more aware of who we are and thus where we are set to be. We were born out of something very small, into a world that has solidified, bearing us. Our very nature to inquire leads to the address of us, and what that suggests we're congenial towards. The problem is that from the path of simpler times, these complicated times feel less integrated, and consequently, I feel like we're fighting our baser ambitions, thwarting them against our base of reason. The two feel contradictory. I must further confess to the irreverence I have to others' folly, but the shame I have placed in their ignorant requests. They have built their impression and resolve - and thus lovingly give such advice - on the basis of those base ambitions; there is no respect or embellishment of our truest and greatest selves; there is no gain from or make to that. And I reason that the very cause of this is in a lack of insight itself. "It is only from the recognition I have of being an agent, that I see the lineage and time thats lead to this point, where that tendency and care was absent."
        <br>&emsp;I am unsure what to do, even if I have seen the righteousness of our gain. The conflict and stress rises from the embers of past ambitions, mixing with the stabilities gained from personal attention and care. I feel so much more comfortable and staunch since I started taking care of myself and settling in. Maybe that thing we were interested in before can be worked towards, with this new strength. I say this then as I have said before now, that the fielty to our aim banishes the rust from that bedrock, to those who would seek proper alignment and the consequently sought rewards; this is what must be done for us to put out the fire. For if we do not act from outside the memory of lust, then that attention will be as turned around towards such vice, and vanity will be our only gain.

        More and more do the tides run clearer, showing me their way, treating me with insight to the nature of the the shore; In that, they show me; to it though, I see our path and claim
        <br>&emsp;If I were to have a little, I could still be alot. With only a slight something though, that being is uncomfortable and, in that respect, restrained. It does not stop me though; I have seen the way in which we'd prosper from this simpler time; in being so though, I feel less clear on the route to its success, and thus remain in our gentle mind. I like it there, am pleased by it - for it is wholesome, - but I do see that a richer and more robust kind of experience, sits outside my door. "I fear not the sword, or the animals. Rather, I am ill proposed to foolish joys or ambition, and I do not quite know where I'd like to go, where if I could not return or stray to another, in that I would not appose." whichever that place is though, and whatever is rooted and sprout from its way, is coming. We are in this place which once held grit and flame; now we are trying to roast an existence on this fire, one which is more regualar and of nourishment. For some time, I felt as though our natural path would take us away, to a place in which we were valuable and seen; It is merely extending the walls though; I am still not outside.

        <div id="freedom">
        If we were free, it would be to write, train, practice and inquire. Around this, there swims a plethora of opportunity for further support and interest. The core of us though is bound through our stake. Philosophy suggests the world's kind, and proposes that we entrench ourselves in the proper resolve. Doing so brings me to fear, for why is there so much yet I feel so not? My suspicion is that you are not treating the aim of your inquiry with the reverence and effect that equals the truth you found. Furthermore, I will add this point of free time, and our consideration of that and its worth. Normally, I find that my efforts to discover and explore are pure and abundant. "Little is left over but rest". What's worth noting though, is the nature of our youth and adolescence. Is it not the case that working enough to provide your time yields the rest for the industrious and or explorative use of it? It may feel as though those grander claims are overfilling (the bottle, so to speak), but is this not the way and period for those cultivating themselves; would the maturing and realization of that offer, be the point in which the ground was wider and solid? isn't it acceptable to reach a fortune of that kind then?
        <br>&emsp;Moreso, would I say that the reticence to work and progress is folly when it comes to having a friendship, increasing room for contributions, efficiency in work or the prosperous and or fortune to travel and be seen: are these not the means to more kinds of generous effort? Is the goal here, not to reach a point where things of a kind are on offer for you to entrench in? If so, then respecting that more youthful and developing stage, cherish the rooted and heartfelt interests and desires of one who has just seen the light; obviously much more has been seen, and old tempers and inclinations remain, but the shoot and seekings of this uplifted man, are they not worth the embellishment and firmness to treat? I'll end on the note and distinction, that it isn't that those future and fortuned gains of interest and craft are not worthwhile, or better yet worth seeking because they are not fundamental; what I would say strictly, is that their worth is only unique in the kind that they are. As vessels and grounds to be generous, their place is equal and of the same, as those purer interests; what must be said and concerned about with those, is equal to these of a fortuned kind. Our place then in valuing so is right and set for a current and immediate address, for it is the kindness of all that meet and base themselves in being a room to tribute, then this is the proper and welcomed way to be.

        <div id="thearchitect">
        To quote Montaigne, “my ambition here is not to tell you the measure of things, rather my view of them.” What I seek is a tremendous expression of the material under that lens; by our industry and creative approach, ‘I mean to express the impression truly found in me’.
        <br>&emsp;The world and its stage can be described amidst the universe - its saga known to. Our place in all of this has the lens of inquiry to consider it all. Applicable to these grounds are principles, narratives of worldly events -like the Russian revolution, or the fall of Rome- summaries of great people and insights of people’s fruitful workings. “Things I have happily grown to hold.” Simply, I wish to place my time and care onto these things. Then, I wish to paint that world as I see it, in the most abundant and personal way. “I see the workings of philosophy, the firmness of the greats, the heritage and sequence of our planet and time, but it is my own tribute that bears a pursuit of expression and design.”
        <br>&emsp;In another light, my attempts here are not to ft the foot to the shoe, or mistake the trees for the forest; I am simply trying to make a garden, an orchard. And I have chosen the fruitings and seeds that will make the color and beauty of those greens and these pastures as lively and heartfelt as I seek. The world is what draws me; in response, I treat it with reverence, generosity and care. I merely wish to arrange the bits that intrigue me onto the canvas in a way in which my craftmanship seeks and settles into. In treating things in a way in which I am wishful and free in the highest of ways to be, is where I am fully living. The route for my love of wisdom, matter and Ryan, is found through this draw that I have to such beauty in the world, and richness to. The gifts of an Architect, are such that they would treat their reverence with such formative abundance. “Wherein the towers we made as tribute could not reach high enough.”

        What satisfies me the most is the knowledge that whatever the circumstance, our aim remains. In our current state, I feel quite dull and apprehensive; our make for stability within our present scenario is progressing with positivity, but only initially, as it then holds me in suspense as time goes on. I know however, that if and when the tide turns our way, or even it is removed or simply delayed, that my gain and claim from such stability does not change, and thus I will rest and settle in, as if our time now and then is the same.
        $Happyand Free
        <br>&emsp;I must clarify on top of that, to attributes that are given any sort of claim. My point before is that regardless of claim, it should at least be consistent in the result you seek; moreso, should it be reliable and substantial in the reward. These traits seem acceptable to our stake. Whether it is cruelty, faith, industry or fame, the positive gain is absolutely best when it is regular and sound. That being said, we can use reason to discern the space around, and see its nature with respect to me. The desire for pain or pleasure is not cut and clear, but that something is pleasant, or that it hurts, is generally objective. Whatever it is that we truly seek, it is safe to say that at the very least, if it is frequent in its offer, and positive in what you seek, then we will say that is good.
        <br>&emsp;It just seems to me though, that certain things better fit the bill, as reason can sharply disclose. For example, sex, drugs, glory and treats, these things are satisfying; you may like this or desire that, but in what manner can they be obtained? It seems that for things in these cases, only the things themselves can prompt satiety; when they are gone so is that feeling, and they return to being sought. Compare that to reading a short essay and the foundedness that sticks throughout you, even when the piece no longer remains.
        <br>&emsp;This sort of thinking is what reason provides, for it tells and clears the way for things to be known in and of themselves. As ones who are thinking, those impressions are likely with respect to us, though still, the result for us is merely a relation to the rooted nature of the thing we are dealing with; case in point, hot water causes burns, but also causes steam to rise from cooler waters; what reason does, is assess and determine the nature of water; as a faculty though, its mix amongst other things melds it into the consensus of that nature being a certain way, as it is with relation to us. Put another way, our determination of something poisonous may be that it holds properties and parts that give it a certain expression; our impression though may be onto this foremost nature, saying what it is effectively to us, in that it is toxic - whereas to rock it may not be, but the substance’s essence and makeup remain.
        <br>&emsp;To return to our heading point, the aim of those wishing to live well can be described best in things that they are doing; at least, we can say that some ‘thing’ is being done, be it of art, entertainment or pure nothingness. Any experience of sorts. What I would say with finality, is that onto a particular thing, one experience will be more positive. I say this based on the nature of things and the nature of the subject; it is likely that a harmony can exist, and thus should be worked towards, for there the best experience is claimed. Referencing our previous points, the nature of ourselves is found through the same means as those of things around us; reason can say what a thing is and what a thing does; in that, we can say and clarify what it is and who we are, and thus, consider and assess what will fit this lane. I feel then, however rumbled my explanation has been, that an objective truth can be discerned about the way one ought to be. Moreover, would I say that any impossibility in knowing one or another’s essence, or being somewhat ineffective in our capable assessment, simply means that the objectivity is not well rounded; it is crisp and jagged though of the soundness shape. “In that I see, that the figure and seems of man, is pure in heart and green.”
        </div>
        <div id="clear">
        If your generosity and care truly marks the measure of expression and joy, then the amount and sincerity in which you materialize this accounts for the soundness way. Be it in family or trades, the world or some craft, our life is so when we are involved in it, throwing ourselves in. "This is where our hearts and minds are rich and bold." We must be resolute to this condition, that if it was to be in lack for some reason, then our defense and installment of success towards the issue had our roots of attention and resolve. Firmly and true, is that rot of living found in ill-defined notions and ways of where it is settled. If we know not where to look, then we will have no sound or effective reach for it, and instead we'll have wasted our time. If living truly is our claim, then the means to that reflects the most necessary condition that is worth and in demand of our respect. If living is what means and draws us the most, then the reason for its success is what is foremost in the value of its development; equally and in contrast, would the ways and efforts that bound us outside of this, be as worthwhile to avoid.
        <br>&emsp;That being said, if we are clear and set to the statement that 'life is lived most and well when we are placed and met in the actual living' has any claim of truth, then the proceeds should continue as follows. If we are to participate, then we should be completely able to -for we will otherwise not do so well. If the reason to participate is constant in its demands so that our aim is met, then so to should our actual interest be held on to. This is because without a target, then no attempt will be made. Instead, if we mold ourselves towards some favorable end, then so to can our actions align. "If the root and trunk of us is clear and set onto what we really seek, then both the means of doing so and our actual success in reaching it, will be higher and subsequent, flourishing to -and would that not be and satisfy us as the furthest gain."
        $TheAim of Living
        <br>&emsp;As I say, we are making something from nothing. The good times that are treating us now are only relevant as you make use of them. No longer and no more do I or will I set myself towards the ease and offerings dealt to us as if glory and praise will surely come. It is true fortune that we have been given, for it is out of the blue and uncommon. Assumed as it may be, or as expected, believing so with surety will not hold true, for even if it were all yours and made for you to hold as a definite claim, you still would not be living the most. “And that recognition that we are so well off but making no use of it, is what feels both alarming and dreadful.”
        <br>&emsp;The most boring notion - as it is the first point of wisdom, and thus for children - is that gifts and sharp offerings are but mere contributions to the true and necessary craft and development for that which yields the greatest claim. These good times are set for you to demonstrate and hone yourself, as to reach and find the sprouting pasture that holds the key to your flourishing way. It is that labor and consistency that will treat you to the soundest offerings, as you are given the room and means to particiapte - which the gain of living requires. That freedom that you have is so that you can and are encouraged to be and embellish your truest self. It cannot be forgotten though, that the way here is no shorter of effort than is required for what is aimed at pleasures and fame; rather, it is a course set on you grandly and happily participating, be it in your craft, your roles and duties, or the reflections and treats in and from your mind. These processes and development are born from and nourished by a stance and resolve that is resolute to the constance and integrity demanded by the maker of a regular flourishing. “That chest is the world and its grandeur; it is its beauty our ability and sense to treat it that draws us to throw ourselves in and marry its tasks, thus making it our stake; in doing so, we are bound and committed to the industry and assemblance of the routine expedition and relishment that requires us so we can maintain the key, and forever feast on the offer behind the door.” Very simply, will that entrance slam shut to those who lack the firmness and strength to turn the lock, and bolt it tight for later - so nothing good slips outside. The crafted and rigorous life is this one where we live the most, ‘for our greatest gain is the one from our living’. It is the treatment we give to the world, when generous and rich with abundance, that our heart and soul feels as imminent and large as would be the case for those being the most. “It is that great and magnificent capacity that describes and boldens us to be: we must simply hold the stake, or aim of this rather.”
        </div>
        <div id="care">
        Considerably, I would inquire to the ends of your time, as did reflect that nature that you supposed. If it were so, would the limit of your nature not suggest that it would come to an end? And if so, how would any action be considered sound and congruent, if this were truly the case yet you did not know? My criticisms are not bound here on your poor choices or use of time. I am merely declaring that because you lack thought into what you are doing, then you lack any reason for doing so - because without any thorough consideration, then no measure for why could be made. "And lacking such insight does not generally fair well for this who would otherwise wish to meet a target."
        <br>&emsp;As one who spends their time alone, my effort is barred within the lines of stable living. In other words, my fortunes rise little but sink little as well; their place around me is minor, as my position is nestled between the utmost simplicity - so I can be myself. In contrast to this, is a common way; in this manner, one's time is more variable, with respect to family, work and friends. This way of living has more stability through its sustenance - as work and relationships provide- whereas the personal path offers little in the plains ahead. On that latter though, do the times remain firm and consistent, moving as a continued stretch into future plots of duration; the former in contrast, has much more that is seen ahead, but pulls you away from being set and at ease within a single place. Moreover, does living in an outwardly way, regardless of how much, take you out of living immediately and for yourself; on the flip side, being completely on your own beckons a lack of insight to the future and what it will bring - for no effort there is being made. Moreso, do you lack the support to and comfort to consider it. "You are merely well and kept in yourself; but in this way you are at best happy with the present, rather than looking ahead." What I find though, is that in each case, the good on offer is similar. Whereas the single way is narrow yet firm, and the invested life bears more of a stretch, both can treat you to an equal amount of gains. "In that, does reaching a place where there is more fortune and friends appease me not, as it ends up treating me the same; moreover, do I not grieve our lacking of it nor our present case of solitude: for in that I am merely set within the greens of ourself." And personally, I find those fruits more whole and lasting.
        </div>
        <div id="solid">
        I am fortunate when things are well. Principally, I overcome things that do not go our way. In other words, I relish and greet posativity, and rise above negativity: This describes and defines the nature of our way. Its target though is beyond the state of the ground. In this land, our generous participation will yeild an active joy; if it is regular and abundant, then we will have a flourishing on our hands. The vessels and crafts which hold these means to tribute vary in applicability for our offer, for two reasons: One is simply having something to give; when we do, our ability to give more accumulates, and the standard by which things draw is more level - compared to the lofty heights of some who require the sun to spin and dance, or at the very least swoon them away. I on the other hand, as a man ripe with interest, can be tributive and pleased to our own very nature - the many things and beings in the world no less. In addition, will the buffet and openeness for our selection, reflect our prosperity. Put another way, if we have more than ourselves to contribute, then we will have more substantiall means to be generous. "It is no less meaningfull to reflect and attest to your nature and time when compared to extravegence and beauty, but the latter offers more room neccessarily, along with being more accepting of any sorts of effort. You on the other hand, will have a more dense and developing state by which your sights can materialze. Moreso, will they bank on the ability and strenght gained from everyday decisions; rollercosters and thrills merely ask that you show up."
        </div>
        <div id="strenght">
        All I have is our sense and those things which I see. In doing so, my place is met and made in the ways of one who knows only what they can, and are as such satisfied with the proper workings of that. "To all else that I do not know, my interest bears no claim. For that which is in my sight or grasp, the arrangement fairs me well when congruence is rooted deep in that." When I lose, I fall back on our aim. From our unsure bearings and consequent haze, those things which I do have hold me nicely. My friends and family, my strength, obligations that bear fortune as well as the ease which I am provided for through congenial roles, these are pleasing and comforting in times of stress or the unknown. "For at least they are there."
        <br>&emsp;What I have though is marked in place which seems unsure. Whether it is enough or is truly admittable in contrast to our struggles around, sees me beyond appreciation. As a response, I have begun to treat myself to the courage of seeking our own self, whereby we settle into our most positive response. Only there we are, and thus can gain, wherein we were made, onto those things no longer with me; then I fall back onto our aim, bringing me to that place where anything lesser merely pulls me from a point where it is known, that none but I am O.K - and only there have I the absolute claim.
        <br>&emsp;Simply put, when I, my aims, my fortunes and trust are enough, no part of me can be taken or slain, nor will the world and its good, or evil, earn anything from me other than my interest and admiration. "For that, I am ok."
        $Theedge of worry lies in the remission from concern; its shadow remains though as you still try to explain and relieve the previous despair. In other words, you improve, finding yourself better off and more happily set; but the issues that were previous still linger, like an attack that promises to strike again. It is the impression of that stalking, that has you reassuring yourself to the good in this moment. The issue arises and is prominent, in the joy and rest in which your new position actually has. It may be the case that past concerns are no longer a threat due to your new fortune, but the worry is only what derails: the problem is still of concern, and you are merely relieved to be outside of its way. The point in which I would advise is that you engender yourself with reason and rationality, as to remove and avoid the actual presence of problems; foremostly, will this allow your care and strength be able to be turned and tuned to more freeing and liberal ways; moreso and with caution, do I suspect that if the problem still prevails, then the worry will soon follow. In your current stead, the issue is present but dealt with. Being out of range of this threat does not remove the lions from Africa though, and when the time arrives in which you are not so set, the worry and fear will bubble up, stressing you out like a wolf's howl in the distance.
        <br>&emsp;It is the removal of assumptions and filling of your mind with true reason and care, that the threats that would otherwise keep you shed off into a more applicable realm. You as a man or woman need regard for the limits within your life, and how you spend your time; it is not the case that true concerns are without any need of regard, but holding onto yourself and possessions is separate from the most rooted concerns. Whichever problem one actually has, let us know that they are simple and small. We are not under threat from bears and sharks, merely the idleness and greed from ourselves. It is not the case that things will not be stolen, or that we will remain forever with fortune and our lives; but we must know that this is understandable and that we can trust ourselves to be formidable. By removing the notion of what is unnecessary, we will not be distraught or with disdain in the presence or expectation that things and fortune will be taken; if that notion is rid of, then we will only have fear and worry about how we use and treat ourselves. Secondly, will the removal of these faulty claims and aspirations settle us into the possibility of more positive and rewarding interests.
        <br>&emsp;As ones who are limited, our time is naturally spent as to fully and consistently express and realize the best we have within ourselves. Our role is not to rule and gain as if we will live and be forever: we are mortal, and simply to that is where, and in what we should be. By assessing ourselves, we can be strong and spry; efficiently and sound from that, can we apply ourselves, wherein joy and cheer are earned from our generosity and interest. From these actions, will we reach the end having lived and dealt with our condition posatively. What this requires, as a seel to this hatch, is the reverence and care to know this is true, and thus hold ourselves foremost and forwardly, wherein we can prosper and fair.

        <div id="withouttrouble">
        As ones then who are well set, but still unsure what to do, my advice is to straighten up and firm the foresight onto what we passively know. If death is what we internally see, then I would remedy the risks of leaving the clarity of it unchecked; in other words, if you don't define and prescribe the notion of how you should be until death, then that baser experience of sensing present threats will not be able to settle, missing out on the advantage it has on truly sitting beside the risk of anything happening at all. Simply said, if the mind which can sense danger does not have a rounded aim of what it knows is guaranteed, and thus expected, then the lack of danger will still see that you know not what to do. Effectively then, the free time you have is not fully spent.
        <br>&emsp;Because the grip you have that is born from the shaft of your mind is lacking, angst and trepidation will follow. This is because without any presence of actual threats, the inability to proceed with respect to the world when positive reflects the fact that you do not know what to do. That knowledge is carried foremost by the marbling of an ultimate threat, from death, that you know is coming as a guarantee -just not now. The mind surely does not know what to do if this were not the case: its nature developed to avoid that which is coming, only it was raised in a way in which this avoidance was imminent and rooted in quick reactions - rather than acceptance of a final promise.
        <br>&emsp;It is easy and known how to respond to a present threat: you run, jump or hide, quickly and with haste. If there is no risk to our scenario, how then should we proceed? I think that perhaps the point must be intuited, by the example of that which wastes our time is known obviously and anxiously felt, yet we are not clear on how and why we are mortal. It may be the case that if time were long lasting and forever, gluttony and tears would be permissible; I say though with respect to our initial suggestion, that this point be drawn sharply, however imperfect the shape in which we'd draw is. For we know for certain that we will die, and that knowing this is the revelation which yields us the truth, in that we can then know where and how to go, since we are familiar and thus able to express that our time is limited. "Proceeding from that, we must gracefully and sincerely sip from the stream."
        </div>
        <div id="mind">
        Clarity of statement is the finest thing for it gives bearing to your judgment, and thus acts as a means for better assessment. I will relate something if I can. In a pre-sifted aim, I see the world ahead through the eyes and mind of one stripped of ambition; as a forward creature who uses reason to explore and define, and bears a nature and compulsion that motivates the gain, I am sure of the uncertainty and partial brittleness to the attempt. The reason, as follows, runs the line of a process, in which one has begun to replace old ambitions with new ones, and is furthering those aims instead. The demonstration of this more rounded and worthwhile way sees the leveling of effort required, for the gains were brought by nature and congruence; the subtle alignments and complexion that changed in order to bring these offerings, were simple and pure, allowing for a smooth obtainment; moreso, when you do reach this claim from maturity, you not only sit with it, easily and with rest, but you see unobstructed interests and gains beyond and further ahead. The area in which I'd inquire is to the gaze that is set, and which horizon you truly see; if your aims are born from stronger roots, then the ambitions will surely follow; my notice though has been to the nature of these views, and whether they are ambition; I find that without the removal of uncertainty, or the upheaving of feeling less than all, than any aim of fortune or venture is minute. "The aim of those inside maturity is a continued reach and gain from being themselves." Searching inward, I relish this mixing of aims by the recognition and embellishment of the world's positivity, that from a point in which all sought is born and found through me, that I am steadfast and secure based on the sensibility and firmness of that. "If I, cannot be moved, then none who would move me have any claim to my response and treatment of the world, and thus her gain."
        <br>&emsp;Sometimes though, I impede myself; this state is not permanent, or consistent even, but I do notice its arrival from time to time, and however much I do see the remnants of the old riches outweighing the current toxicities, my aim and forwardness bears towards certainty and being all. What I believe and resolve from this particular experience, is that the state of goodness and ease brings on itself without strictness and heft; furthermore, and to the point, is the nature of one who is mature realizes that 'they' are maturing; the remedy of this is to materialize and cherish the fidelity for this evolving process, and hearing its model of impermanence and shakiness; "what I have seen is that if my aim is not one of gurantees, then the means by which I generate a development, need not be for so, and thus it to can nestle in and set itself towards the state of development: It takes the day off naturally when I am flourishing, for it as reason has done its job, and I can regularly and perpetually carry my way; she merely showed me how."
        </div>
        <div id="memories">
        Memories play a strong role in remedying stress. Looking back on the past, I see how the future seems bright moving forward; foremost is the notion that previous mistakes are no longer being made and, moreso, do current fortunes and prominences of satisfaction feel more substantial. In this, you can reap the rewards of your own trajectory. Forewardly, the aims of the past have materialized into the claims of the present; in seeing that, one can be reassured that more will come which is good, and less will appear which is bad. Particularly and to my point, when you have reflected on what trail you have left, will you be shown the improving steps that have come from the steps before. From that, memory is profitably known.
        <br>&emsp;Generally speaking, this kind of inquiry leads me to a place in which certainty is unpacked and I look for a route forward based on strength. Here, however, I see the nature of our class, wherein its set is rooted in the essence of being one who inquires, and thus my clarity and rest is well founded through the strength I have in demonstrating this way. Better said, as one who thinks and inquires, leaving the inspection of what that means and, equally, what I would venture to propose, becomes less necessary when I am more congenial to the medium of thinking. In a similar way to one who achieves a victory or reward, the foundedness and feeling of being set, seeps in and takes me naturally, as I have met my way. Understandably then, if thinking well is the virtue within my expression, then doing so well will be evident equal to my awareness of the task. In other words, as much of a grasp as I have of being a thinker, or rather one of the intellect, then the use of this well will reveal itself as a measure of congruence within the demands marked by the nature of the medium; moreso and to my point, will rich and proper thought seem prominently good and truthfully meritable with respect to the sharp use and embellishment of our foremost way. Case in point, would my use of attention and care be less satisfactory if it were spent towards gluttony and deceit; these things may be fine, but evidently, at least, feel in contrast and thus opposed by the strong and rational mind. On that latter, be it the true foundation, or at least the thing which seems worthwhile to seek, then the gains of that will equally be met when the treatment of our time and energy is made from the tribute and demonstration of it.
        <br>&emsp;As one who is rational and clear, the actions and time spent from this lane (so to speak) will be most rewarding. As a thief whose profitable and at home through connivery, or a priest who is sound through his charity and faith, the work and admittance of rational actions and deeds, is what will please and ingratiate the mind that is rational, and thus earn you an experience filled with generosity and ease. "As one who is born and with nature to inquire."
        </div>
        <div id="thegrey">
        When I am older, I will die. This is principally because I am limited, am a living thing, and have known all others alike, to reach and meet the same. How I know this for sure, is that my certainty lacks only the knowledge of the absolute. I believe it follows that if my limits were not in place, then to each and all I could know. The very fact though that there is and seems to be a place and grain for inquiry, suggests that I am not full and complete. It is the attempt then, and our fielty in being able and tasked with doing so, that draws us forth wholeheartedly and staked towards the end of one who is as such(limited). Having a resolve then is tricky, as I am not completely sure what to base it on. If my actions give repercussions after death for example, my efforts may be placed regarding this, whereas if they are not and I am merely subject to nature and here way, then my aims will orient themselves with that in mind.
        <br>&emsp;The Philosopher is one who makes additions to our understanding of what rests outside the mold. Moreover, does a man take what he has, and bring himself from the ground up, reaching at least to some sort of height -however unknown the end may be. To that, I have found that both sentiments are co-operatively demonstrated over the course of each of their uses. Put another way, as you mature by addressing your actions and time, the question and worry of what lies further beyond becomes more prominent. "It's as if by becoming so sound and pronounced, that your gaze sets further ahead; the haze and mist blurs the far off destination though: that is the Grey."
        <br>&emsp;In that case, the Man will proceed with confidence; necessarily, this is the case because he is unsure -and in some primal way afraid. Moreso, he is in need -and astute consequently- for demonstrating courage and strength 'as he makes forward, towards a place unknown'. Additionally though, will this person of attention and care, also set his pretensions about what is unknown into an orderly and reputable fashion. "As mentioned, the Man will not know everything, but he can at least know this and admit it without feeling scarcity." It is easy to feel safe and sound when nothing is there(or suspected) that merits any alarm. What happens when you see and are treated to the world in all its fullness; better yet, the whole and vastness of existence and entirety? There are surely things in there that are uncommon and legitimate in making us scared or afraid: the Man is simply one who bears the load, and pushes forth despite the worry. "Here, he is carried by courage and strength, not certainty and remission of the concern."
        <br>&emsp;Anyways, the point I wished to illustrate is that although the Man can proceed into the fray, and moreso can he admit that his treatment will be unknown, he can still employ his ability to consider and inquire. In other words, if he can see the path ahead but not what lies around the corner, then his regard can at least be towards something which seems most likely, if not probable. "A fear of ghouls and dragons is no fair claim, for even if nothing expected is known, we can at least be sure that what occurs will be in the realm of what's possible." It is from the base of that notion, that simple reflection and care can be placed by the man onto the common happenings of the world; moreso, can he reflect on other people's experience through first hand storytelling, or impressions left by books or some other form of craft. "The David tells so much; someone made this, suggesting their nature to do so. The complexity and figure of the make reflect the persistence and interest of the sculptor, furthering our base understanding of what the environment must have been around -It cannot be the case that this or any great piece of art was built in combat, or with the support and aims of foolishness or war. Moreso, can we see who the worker was of, in kind that is. In clearly seeing such things in this way, so to can we find comfort in the whole -for we see the scope of its nicer elements. "
        <br>&emsp;These impressions from others, or the simple experience you have been dealt with first hand, make way for what the world is in the commons. When you see that there is so much that has been offered, can you really be afraid of anyone built and made of a similar kind? And besides that, can we at least say that the vicious environment has little effect? Some people have obviously been subject to turbulent winds, violent floods or blazing flame; but it seems minor. Unless you have experienced this first hand -moreso could you reflect on anyone else who had- can you really say that this is a likely worthwhile concern? "Don't burn down your house, and if tornadoes have you worried then don't move to Kansas, but what is the expectation of it happening eventually based on?" It seems that if we measured ourselves on what occurs most common and often, we would see and be pleased by the notion that it is not that bad. Moreover, could we address our own decisions and use of our time, and how that made the bulk of our days more pleasant and kind. The Man then(we could say), is one who has these expectations. He doesn't affirm that nothing bad will happen, rather he sets himself into his own time and business. In using that well, the world seems tame and lighter; moreover, can he rest on the notion that his concerns are of things that are inevitable -and it is the recognition and acceptance of that being his nature, that has him satisfied that it is not a slight to take this fortune, wherein he can resolve himself to treat it openly, and carry himself towards it well.
        <br>&emsp;People are afraid of what they don't know will happen. The mature man is not so afraid. His past time has been grasped and thus the future feels more common -for it bears more expectation of treating him the same. In addition to his strength that curbs all concern, it is his regard and care for himself that sets those unknowns in order. "However much and cruelly unscripted, can we be at least sure to the thing which it likely is." In bearing that strength towards what seems probable, the simplicity in our life can bind itself into the meaning of that end, that if it were understandably equal and as much, then it would be no problem. And if so, and this were our way, then our greatest earnings and claim would be in the way in which we were resolute, and how we demonstrated ourselves with respect this end; whereby if we believed and held it thoroughly to be true, then our aims and contribution would seep the congruence and embellishment into and from the roots of that. If our way truly has a palpable end, then our meeting of it shall be held with laughter and cheer, reminiscing how we got here by the notion that our greetings would be without regret and remission, rather treating us to a time which was well founded, generous, kind, industrious, positively flourishing and true. "In that, we say, that our claim is such, and we make for this gain."
        </div>
        <div id="peace">
        The world seems amiss sometimes. My place in to is not always much but clever, but our time in it is not so happily bad. The truth, as it seems, is unclear. My sight on it though is fairly founded: I just can't round its edge. The lack of solidity that follows sees me without great fortune - for the right way has dangled her more gentle aims slightly out of reach. I do look around and see where there are common opportunities, but I am generally left seeking those higher claims.
        <br>&emsp;My goal then is to simply be. Doing so well is equal in its soundness, 'for I would otherwise be struck, or waiting'. My nature is one, and overall I have continued to learn what it means. Fogged in front of me though is the grey, of which my answer seems unseen and unknown. Wherever other people sit and lie, it is not elsewhere in idleness and stress; even if these describe their place, they are not permanently settled - everyone strives for comfort and aims in some sort or fashion.
        <br>&emsp;What differs though, is what is then worth seeking? Where I have often and currently stand, is in trekking through the woodlands of uncertainty, whereby a search for more profitable knowledge is in the make. "When I was younger, this approach saw our travels as the gain of our way; as I have matured, I have rounded myself to rest and be pleased with the land that you have so far discovered." What differs though is in the far off promise, whereby my venture strives for and seeks. Seeing so much more in the distant land, my only resolve is to then be an adventurer, an explorer at least. Like any good pilgrim, we wouldn't pack for a short days ride; moreover would we not expect to get there in finality any time soon. Our course seems best then when it has some destination, even if that is simply a direction - so we can hold forth with bearing, looking for and claiming what we find. Stopping along the way though to make camp and clear out the present piece of land, seems proper with respect to the scope of our journey. Resting along the way and taking what little there is in, will not only keep your spirits high but configure the far off target in and towards the strongest reward. "If something good is not enough, then its shortcomings will reveal what would be even more substantial. Additionally, will the qualities that you actually seek become more clear and engrained, yielding a wider and purer scale for things to be measured."
        <br>&emsp;It seems that the journey of man is set on finding the best and greatest thing; and onto this part, there may only be ideals and dreams to define it. What I believe though, is that by being attentive and tuned to what you currently have as well as the nature of your present place, will a sharper and well fit use of that accurate measure develop; herein will those values we target will be more full and congenial in their make and claim. Knowing what we seek to be true, and considering that the best and most positive thing is where that aim is deemed, will give the necessary mark for things that fit this highest measure. Onto our actions and fortune, will congruence have a mold that's set - and if it is onto whatever bears the utmost and greatest, will this bear our search through excellence a success that is worthwhile and foremost as our gain.
        </div>
        <div id="happy">
        If we are happy, it is because our situation and use of it is tight and pleasantly met. How my time here is spent though, determines and reflects our forward experience; in other words, if we are fortunate and free, then it is the use and stake through this way that garners a joyful prominence: when this is consistent, we are flourishing. What the world is, is simply a state of circumstances, in which those who could and can use them, do so more and more to their success. "It seems acceptable that actions done merit the set of one who is made to improve upon subsequent uses. In doing so, it can only be said, that by cultural transmission, or individual experience, that one's time will be furthered in congruence and thus harmony, in whichever scenarios their made." My point is that solidity and fortune will gradually improve, at least, for you are one who is consistently asked, and thus obliged and lucky to be regular in your action - warranting developments and an advance.
        <br>&emsp;It seems that as this way is brought to fruition, you will be proper and rooted. Being so though, your time will not necessarily be the best. It may follow that one who was able to hone themselves to this line of congruence would be equally thoughtful and able to treat it well, but that is beyond the point. For all in good times or bad, the state and measure of your time reflects the reason that the effort was worthwhile at all. "Even if your time at work or within some duty or task was satisfying and enjoyable, this merely marks the fact: if you are pleased and enriched through the participation and act of living, then your life can be said to be achieved and experienced well." My note however, is that for one who is leveled in their challenge and obligations, then the time spent on top of this is not so obvious and clear. People make the mistake of thinking that their responsibilities are there to serve their time of interest, rather than their actual goal of providing stable ground for better living. Moreover, if your tasks and roles are met, and you are left wondering what to do or waiting for the next stretch of effort, then going out for drinks and fun will not produce further provisions. "It's as if we think that the week is over so we should go out and eat wings and do drugs; what about tomorrow though, or the week ahead? How much will you be enthused beyond relief from the drudgery of the work ahead, when this next week is over?"
        <br>&emsp;In short, if our responsibility is the bedrock of our ability and means to live, then our use of what this offers should primarily avoid the removal of such ability. In other words, let's say that the time that is offered from meeting these obligations with success is just if it is positive towards the nourishment and support that granted it. Therein, if the weekend comes around, the partying and fun we seek is not overtly bad, rather it is incongruent and thus unjust to the tasks ahead. As mentioned, this negativity will weigh down the work to come, draining the future of other bouts of recklessness and their satisfaction; more importantly, though, is that it is in contrast to the better kind of living itself.
        <br>&emsp;That stronger and well founded experience is not only well placed and set to continue its support and use, but is staked in purer and sounder measures. For example, the tits and tats of beer and fun are principally limited to the presence of the object; furthermore and the foremost point, is their involvement is fundamentally gluttonous and spiritually constricted. What is higher than this brief moment of indulgence and relief from the previous effort is a time and way which is solid yet round, rich yet gentle, wherein the grooves of your mind are equally and as robustly sparked as the warm and tender parts of your heart and bones. The body we seek is one that rests easy and settles in, whereby activities of greatness and cheer are emplaced and engaged substantially and frequently; throughout the hour, and over the weeks and days ought this be our reward. This briskness and love is best when it flows strongly yet simply throughout your muscles and mind: and onto that which it would dream of and lift, marks the finest objective that holds our aim above.
        </div>
        <div id="grace">
        Work is a struggle because there is weight: we can bear it though. That it would be smooth, or rather how much of a load there is, is in some parts determined by the reason for its press; or in other words, if the duty laid upon you was legitimate, then an unwarranted trouble it would not seem. Consequently, the willingness and reason to partake in it would open you up to treat it freely and with reverence. It is at that point that the actual demands of the role are in place. They are not bound in criticism and regret though. And seeing then what it is they are truly meant to be, gives me a firm and ready grip onto them. Foremost then is the weight acceptable. Not only as we have said does this reduce the perceived and thus responded to demands, but your alignment and composure in treating what there is amounts to more itself, wherein you generate more power and strength to carry this reasonable load -which consequently feels less heavy.
        <br>&emsp;What we have reached is a gracious point of reason. Better said, onto those points and composition born from deliberation and care are aims that are materializing as our foremost stake. Moreso, have these begun to take sway -wherein we are no longer trying to re-route ourselves away from tradition and towards purity. In our case, our youth was deemed hostile in what it asked and offered us; consequently, we took more time to deal with ourselves and solidify new values. Understandably, if one was set for those traditions, then their place in youth would have a point to build up; or, in other words, when they were at the starting line of the next stage of their life, the efforts and promise of proceeding were justified and set. In our situation, the values that were in place felt hollow and assuming. The point I am trying to illustrate is that when we discerned new values, our position to proceed towards them was different than those previous moments -which were more accepting to the (then) present lane. Initially, those new values were not fully understood as to their promise; moreover did I not even know. Where I found myself often was in a state of hopefulness and confidence, 'that my success would be similar to those in the previous lane, only in our case it would be achieved through these newly founded reasons and character'. Additionally, the time and place to make for the objective that reflected those values was not as prominent or present. "Whereas upon graduation I was expected to and encouraged to go to school and make use of all the resources and time, my place later and especially now, has less openness and room to proceed; moreso, is there less value to impart due to the expended efforts so far."
        <br>&emsp;The consequence which I wish to draw is that in rooting myself in those newer values, their objective was ill defined; my actions thus had no target to follow and very little success was made. I think the best example to describe this is as follows. You are a carpenter, and that has needs. Not only do you wish to build and ripen the skill to do so, but you also have base interests that reflect what holds the carpentry: the fact that you are a man. Now, if you build things successfully, but find yourself without much compensation, then your natural stance as the carpenter may be the only thing that bears fruition. The basic needs must be provided elsewhere, causing friction for those more genuine efforts. However, the point worth drawing is that even though you have not rooted yourself as a carpenter into the world, you are still one due to your personal creation. The idea of an objective then, is one that reflects a sounder measure of what you would do as a carpenter, and in turn have more accessibility to the world. This is because if your skillset can demonstrate itself in an impressionable way then the opportunities present will become more available as your own prominence becomes more outwardly suitable.
        <br>&emsp;This notion reflects the friction between the real world and your inner nature. In that case, its opposite would be a strict focus on what the world needs: but a consequent ignorance of who you truly are. The goal of Man seems to be a formidable expression of his truest self, wherein the response is one that reflects his fitting, and he is equally and soundly set because the impression is from that truest self. The story goes that we are raised and told how to live by those who have personally failed. Whether they have achieved outward success, or offer only regretful and resentful lessons, the message still outwardly remains. No one ever told us why or how to be ourselves: it's as if they never knew. We are animals though, of a reasonable kind and this means that our foremost state is within the use of that reason. Within that state of thinking and inquiry, the short of it lies in accurately assessing what there is, and what you ought to do. What we were told and given was a posturing account of the world; moreover, were those aims of 'success and stability' promised through the poorest form of effort. What I mean to say is that who you are must be dug out of the ground and given some roots and legs so that you can properly bloom. The resistance though, is that growing a tree takes time, and in contrast to the tree you have already risen, there will be difficulties for these new accomplishments - as people are limited in their ability to understand. But were there. And I don't know how but it seems irrelevant. What stands before me is the true field of opportunity and present gains. Onto the way forward, the treatment is equal in the parameters found in those of traditional interest: the only thing that differs is what we're striving for - and my aim there reflects the rise of me. "Thus where we will build from: and I need not their approval, for what they wished for of me, I have already claimed."
        </div>
        <div id="offer">
        I have done it: I am ready to make my proposal. As it goes we are natural. The reason is unclear but the steps towards it are as follows: we are limited because we have to inquire. On one front this is evidently because we can, but equally if not moreso, onto the furthest and greatest claims, the anwser we dont know: and this need then for inquiry reflects our limited composition. Ontologically this seems sound. We are addressing this case through cognitive action, and cementing the findings as the root of our make. The action though suggests we have a nature: which fortells that we have a stake. This is so because to ones who are natured, it is reasonable to suggest that per their kind, they are inclined to be a certain way. "If there are many kinds of nature, then the action that suitably follows will be regarded as our personal tendency. Consequently, will the medium in which we are placed bear things which are congenigal to those inclings; the congruence by us towards those things which naturally fit our way, is the means to a truly rich and abundant experience: of which is a natures foremost claim."
        </div>
        <div id="wherefore">
        I'm ready to make a real proposition. It follows like this. I have many things and have seen many more; they are not mine though. In treating my experience of people, interests and care with clear attention, I can see that we are separate. What I propose, however, justly follows. What I would say is that what I have is rooted in what I've defined. There is much as I said that I have seen, but it is mere minnows swimming in the pond. Regarding what I have actually thought upon and assimilated within me, this creation is truly what we'll say is mine. "And I stand on it nicely, fittingly and tall."
        <br>&emsp;The amount in this case though, seems hollow. It is not from a lack of opportunity to incorporate; on that there is a wide selection of things viable and interesting. What it is, is within the limits of what the west has referred to as the Logos. Effectively, the sounder measure where the aim of this approach is placed is prior and thus a mere precedent to our actual use of the answer found. Or in other words, from our inspection of the world, be it accurate or not, acting upon the results forewards us into what we are meant to be.
        <br>&emsp;I believe the problem is two fold. On one hand you have the sense that your impression is incomplete, and your action is thus without a proper case to follow. Following this sentiment though, we can see that a reverence for purer insight wagers us against the proceeds that need to follow. Where we limit ourselves in this regard is in remedying the concern for certainty, but searching for meaning instead. Better said, do we wonder what our findings are meant for us to entail; or in other words, what is the measure that reflects the proper use of knowledge. Interestingly, it appears that our theological tendencies were bent towards this concern whereas our more scrupulous past saw more attention paid onto better defining those things in which our values meet.
        <br>&emsp;Briefly, I think that clarifying that notion of figures and resolve would go a long way toward furthering our proposal. To the former, I mean our impression of what a thing is; the latter reflects the scale that determines what these things mean, or in regards to them what we should do. My suspicion is that the exact need for either is the effect of each being too emphasized, while the other is given too little regard. Plainly speaking, it seems that our means for investigation and our inquiry into our personal values balance eachother out in being significant in our own circumstances. "The problem with religion and philosophy is that they seek to reach a point of complete understanding; both in terms of how things are and how we should be." Principally, I find this wrong through our ontology of inquiry and its limits proposed. Moreover, does the real reflection of who we are bring a forefront line wherein a relevant and effective guide can offer the answers we seek to gain.
        <br>&emsp;It is in the mere fact that our fundamental interests are rooted in our own desire. Questioning whether our aim is just is worthwhile: that there is one though and what this means, seems to clarify and proclaim where it is our effort should be. Moreover, does the presence of any kind of desire, suggest that there is an accomplishment worth achieving; moreover could we say that there is one that is appropriate -as much as we have something uniquely congenial." This latter point reflects my forward sentiment. At heart, this example illustrates a piece of our humanity. That we are ones seems definite; of what kind and in what mannered way, this is the question. What I would propose is that we solidify ourselves under the notion of the things we are. Regardless of the kind and manner, can our ability to adjust and inquire bring us to a point in which the optimal way to be is discovered. What my point rests on though is this presumption, that of men and reason, we are. Of which type or variety, the particular kind will be considered good if it is positive.Of which and what kind I do not know. My principle confession merely rests that there is one to be had -because we are so. Our industry and strength is simply best if it is applied to uncovering what that is. My suggestions are strictly onto what that resolve should be if our aim is one that offers an experience of prosperous ability and joy. My imperative though, and of which my proposal's objective is set to request, is that we base our actions and interest on the principle that there is an experience to be sought for at all. "And to that, there is puzzlingly set the mystery of personal definement, and the dynamics cultivating what it hopes to fair.
        <br>&emsp;Personally, I am satisfied with this quest due to the implication of what this inquiry means to me. Ontologically, it suggests I exist. Because it is deliberate, it suggests that we have a nature, for we are actionable, and possessing at least some portion of it which is of a prominent kind. That our scope would have some weight regarding an aim, then seems well founded and true. Foremost from the fact that our experience -in deliberate inquiry- suggests a result which is better than some; moreover that this suitable kind of being would be more elaborate and substantial due to the presence of prominence within our expression (I suspect). That this grandest and purest experience is our aim, is marked by the inspection of our own ability to inquire; the resolve and aim to act accordingly seems consequently worthwhile and legitimate. To my end in rest, from the road of joy until then, I say forwardly that this is enough for me, and consequently proclaim that we set our minds around this, and affirm tremendously to ourselves that it is where we intend to go: and is thus our stake and aim, the seems and lining of which I propose we sow.

        <div id="aproposal">
        It is hard to make proposals. “What about this my lord?” they howl; I reply “I am not your king.” They shout back “then why are you telling us what to do!” I merely say “I am only asking you to agree.” They respond then with “and what if we do?” Therein I stand firm and forth, venerating the proper course of conduct wherein I say “ladies and gentlemen, I am Ryan. I am not your king nor your ruler: I simply have a proposal to make. What it is based on is lengthy and substantial; what it personally amounts to though is short and sparse: for I fear too much to say a lot when only a little of it is known.” I stammered, but kept on. “I have arrived at something I am confident in though, and am thus assured in making it my claim. It is an offer, of which you can repeal and or spite. I do believe it has merits however, and to each of you I recommend that you heed its sentiment and consider to you, whether it is or is not true. If it seems so, then you may assent; if it does not, then you can descend from here, and in addition oppose.” One man who stood took the crowd to new lengths of which they had never known. He said, “what is it you mean to say, be quick about it!” I stood even more firm, beginning to settle as I was already clear on where I needed to go. In that spot, I made my claim.”I propose that we live our greatest way. That is, we should live appropriately with respect to our kind, so that our experience is rich in its gain. That this is good and true is what I mean to propose: I am merely resting on the fact that you are all rooted in a kind of which we are made the same. What I see then is that what you see as promising, of which you might refer to as positive and or profitable, would mark your regard in assent and resolve -as would be the case for that appropriate action and aim for which your nature is made.” The crowd shuffled, unassured yet equally unassuming. I furthered, “that this is the way I do not know: for I cannot. This is principally the case as my deepest inspection has revealed to me. What this suggests and henceforth where my attention goes, is how this limit reflects the nature in me, and thus where I am best to go. You see friends, having a nature or kind means that there will be particular interests and needs which optimally correspond. What is then congenial to us, will reward our state of congruence and solidity.” I cleared my breath for the following would be my greatest set, “and it is that joy, that flourishing, prosperously and in abundance that we would gain, that I wish for us to strive for and meet. It will be easy I promise: we are merely lining ourselves to the world as to reflect our proper make. All this requires is the inspection of what that is that we truly are; if we can know the world in an equally detailed manner, then fitting the two will be a breeze. Working through this way together is in short what I propose.”
        <br>&emsp;The crowd seemed to be coming in and out of attention. The facts were not dismissable, but the reflection within our suggestion bore them little stake: eventually though, I gave more particular application. “Simply put my friends, I am tired. Too long has it been since my kindred effort and ways had a friend, and the time is right and now for the aim of freedom and industry to win. This is the mold for the spot that marks and houses the objective we seek: what I wish for and where I am ordained to propose, that these interests be embellished through community and conviction. I am no longer going to go towards the greens we seek on my own, for as I’d strictly claim, the pasture here is for all. What I am is simply a man, not your ruler and king. It is from my own inquiry that I have been treated: what I wish is for us to act the same, and share a bigger bounty. Someone shouted from the crowd, with others by their side, “why should we listen to you, your barely past a boy!” I was not struck or shaken. “I don’t give you these thoughts as some form of judgment or demand; I simply wish to offer you insight into what I see; and if you, being so old and mature seemingly, could offer the time and care to listen, then do so willingly; as I would be most pleased as to share my interest in making this opportunity a collaborative one. I cannot say whether we will succeed or fail; but through my own years of tremendous thought and care can I say to you forwardly and true, that there is green and warmer seas near and on the horizon. That is where I wish to go: but I believe that you will be suited for it to.
        <br>&emsp;As it were, they were slipping; so I stood and spoke directly and forth. “What I propose is that we hold this aim. In tending to the land together, will earn us all the greatest claim. The only power that I would wish to have is in offering you the opportunity to reach these profits: for it is within your generous actions and industrious ways that the rewards from care and contribution will be met -and onto those claims, I mean to widen the road. If this place is one in which we’d truly prosper, then it will be for one and all. If we choose to be alone, then we will be at most happy in dark -as I have been. I want to be out in the world with all its riches and abundance, and effortlessly offer my own time and treatment. Does the prosperous joy and gain of that not reflect what all of us seek: are we not of a kind which can work towards and make this happen? I want more of this true abundance in my experience: but I have only been so alone and inside. With a friend or a group, for humanity, will our collaboration and effort earn us this greatest gain -and all the wins from the achievement that follows. What I simply propose is that we stake this in deep as our objective, and arrange ourselves with a resolve to work towards and reach this way. The steps towards it seem only common and natural as our previous ventures have revealed: we split the atom to end the war, and have made the world that’s followed more leveled and free. Let’s use it openly, we can. The way in which is only limited by our own proposal, that doing so is the worthwhile claim. By selecting ourselves to be reverent and set towards this stake can our resolve bring us to the target we seek.” “Is that it,” they said, howling with brutish despair. A conclusion was all I could make. “Where I stand is on these sides of life that feel most promising: my command though onto this end, if I could only in short say, is that we furnish ourselves and sharpen our desires, to mold in and make it an aim. For in that, I am proposing a way, in which together, we could all achieve this gain.” To those who listened, they at least headed; some went forth, and others around, but at least their respective paths were somewhat profitable -by virtue of their deliberation. Those who knew so well otherwise, well they ran away and fought eachother; for what they sought had nothing by meatless bone -which made competition only more likely, as no one could win.
        <br>&emsp;And I alone, sat on my throne, of our own, amongst the world and men. Only, as a man though, were they all friends to me, as I to myself. “And in that, was I set and present to a lasting aim -of which the collaboration would seemingly further, and thus what I proposed.”
        </div>
        <div id="makinguse">
        Very simply, my mind has left itself from being contrast to an objective. Prior, I felt very firmly that I would be treated and rewarded for who I am; the work I would do did seem great, but the emphasis was motivated by the need and assertion that I would be granted a profited response. What seems obvious now, is that good things will happen because they were aimed at. The repercussions will grant the relevant rewards, but the goods must be made. My resolve then is to remove ambition and develop an aim. More to the point, would I say that my objective fields and houses our efforts, as to employ and demand we participate in an oriented and founded way; here, we can then offer ourselves and contribute, whereby the means to do so are furthered through the effort and reached upon our aim of flourishing generosity and joy.
        <br>&emsp;I see so much that has gone by wherein I was waiting, expecting, striking my pose with victory seemingly on the horizon. The bedrock though was less of what would warrant me to be champion." Releasing myself from the demands of discipline and focus, I instead leapt into the planes and eye of glory and infamy." I've lost friends, spoilt roommates, squandered time and energy that was previously set for the right kind of care. Moreover, have I yet solidified myself into something which is actually true to me. "It's as if all these years have gone by, and I am only just now realizing that there is someone to be."
        <br>&emsp;My remission is a struggle, for the effects of reaching this point aside from truth and her congruency sees me thin in my objective and cold onto what I freely declare. It seems that this realization is minutely obvious, as we try harder to be separate from our previous impotence, we still turn back towards the glory and fame - merely from higher above. Being here with status though, morally, still sees me shot with poor assurance; moreover, am I reticent to take on or be alive in the hopes and pursuit of our human riches. A girlfriend, quicker earnings, means to greatness, or simply the breath and fairs of a friendship, equally slip my time. As I said, we are in the bunker, selling ourselves short of what would actually be a sound exchange.
        <br>&emsp;But our energy and care has not always been here though, and moreover is our place now not so easily amended. "As I say, happiness is the beginning, whereby the ground is open and free for you to work for and contribute into what you seek the most." The problem though is that in our current state, this reassembly was made whereby our circumstances barred youthful and naive optimism. We have to be sound and sharp onto what we actually need, for no one else is providing. Moreso, is this not a place to find out what it is we really seek: for that is what the previous time was for. Whether we are in good times or bad, our aim is now rooted in the objective that sprouts it, regularly and through. What our goal is then, is to nourish and support the means of progress and development in this case. "It is our end though, and all but we are gone."
        </div>
        <div id="adolescence">
        I was born to be made, yet my interests were lined with tradition and unclear aims. As a youth I rebelled, reaching a point of adolescence later on -where my reverence and respect demanded I comply. I did so for some time without sparse willingness, ending up near the ground below. Better said, I resisted and denied the values that seemed so necessary, and I tried to find something that suited me, with positivity, and exponentially more. Moreover, in those more base and common states, did I see no need for ambition to rid me of their stiffness; instead, I leaned inwards and solidified my own heart and bone. In doing so, the predicament became more leveled and manageable, 'whereby things we alright as they were, because I was now better'.
        <br>&emsp;The years that followed this however, are best described as one who still sees those further claims outside their current position. The reason being that in that personal solid state, my interests and values changed. Rooted in this inward stability and strength, the aims I had were much more involved with my own creative and studious efforts. Moreso, did my circumstantial needs wain as what I sought was pure effort -which required nothing more than me to gain. Our scenario still asked me to provide for it though and this upset me. Those values and aims which were more industrious and personal bore the true and worthwhile target: I did not know why I should or otherwise had to provide. Consequently, I took advantage of times when nothing but those efforts were supported. I would live at home, or be more costly in my spending -because I had no future monetary intentions. The rot under the tree though, is that I always sought to remove the need for that situational stability. Even if I was living at home, the promise of future roles and tasks held me back from making better use of that freer time. " Its as if I knew I would eventually return to those rugged grounds."
        <br>&emsp;This bore two things consequently. Within our green estate -which I spent reoccurring years and time- my efforts were never set or consistent. If I ultimately spent 8 months there, I never did so under that notion; even if I knew I would be there for a long time, my foresight was still shadowed by expectations; my purer efforts were thus dealt with more immediately -and this prevented any lasting stretch of work, as it felt like it needed to be done now. "And nothing great, like Rome, can be built in a day." On top of that(as our second point) sits the fact that this hesitance developed a desire for those purer aims to be provisional to themselves. In other words, my true and rooted claim was the joy and feeling from writing; unable to do so consistently because I saw the responsibilities ahead, I sought that the writing would make me a success -all so I could write! This sentiment put my interests up on a pedestal, whereby their value became rounded in their potential; moreso did I see myself as more impressive for having such ambitions from these great works. The repercussions of this were a long developed anticipation of being treated fortunately and with praise, because of who I was personally, and from the works that followed. In bringing it out, the early stages of it could not support its own effort, so our dreams turned towards how and when that could be. In those goods we did not grow, and neither it as our prospect nor our most sought effort, developed any way far and further -by which there was no innate fortuned gain.
        </div>
        <div id="olddays">
        Similar to our stake in Ontology, it would be wise to rest on and proceed from the soundest principle. Foremost it would seem is to remove and relish the fact that we have: our vanity. As previously stated, we've come from tradition and youthful grounds, whereby our aims and interests were embellished through the motivation of achievements valued during the times before; moreover, are the means to those not as strictly accessible towards are newly developed claim for success. Considering the partial difficulties of moving forward from this place, I recommend we remove the false interests and expectations of that time before. Seeing as we are set to something further and large, our aim of it must be clear as can be: and those anticipations and regard for ones self that sprouted during our juvenile stage, have neither a claim in our current objective nor any means to support it. Additionally, as a remedy and better means to what we can find, are things that better fit the place of our current ambition. In other words, we should remove the rust and brevity of our previous days, and fill them up with equal consideration for these newly founded objectives. In short, we shall and have removed our vain demands and given our new goals more chances of success -appropriate to them that is. "As if our goods and character are to be rewarded and praised for what they are, rather than the treatment through the value that they provide."
        </div>
        <div id="constance">
        It is clear that work is required. It pumps you up and keeps you limber and accepting of fuel, which supports your industry and make. These efforts require recovery though. If the means to generosity and concentration are found in fitness and physical stature, maintance of that engine is paramount - equal to the worth of the aims it provides. I've noticed however, that being in that industrious state, keeps me active and thus prevents rest from happening. It does sort me out though and generally contributes little in the wake of fatigue, but it seems to prevent decompression and re-establishment of those inner cogs.
        <br>&emsp;Being active is not contrary to our success; it is what provision is for. My experience in being imperfect has shown me though, that poor choices render the dullness in the consequent rest, to be similarly poor. When I train and recover, it is best when it fits the line of being restorative. Otherwise, if I am idol and stiff, I tend to be the same. Our active stake can be helpful here, tending our meantime to be more hospitable and congruent to easier movements and simple rest.
        <br>&emsp;It seems as though our aim is a plea where I seek and look to return. The actions that bring about this have my intentions in being regular to that; they're behind us though. Our imperfection brings us to seek a better past, where decisions and lack had not yet been made. Moving forward then sees only knowledge of how and what was lost, defining it in the way you proceed so as not to make it again. My answer to each question when it comes to resolves, is by addressing the means by which that past was garnered. Assuredly it was done by precedent decisions. Had those actions not been tampered with and your bearings changed, you would be equal if not more, and remain thus satisfied.
        <br>&emsp;We must trust our actions to void us of harm and earn a preferable way; as far as we stray we'll discover that which is incongruent; equally, what is pleasurable and sought will reinforce similar actions, bearing us the knowledge of the truth of how we bring that way. Our responsibility and decisions then should stem from the ease of continuation, progress towards things that seem evident to contribute more, and, adjusting away from those things which cause such stray, bearing us back towards the good in our core.
        </div>
        <div id="character">
        As a preface, I will say this promptly: if you are a sound person, it is because your character and ground is rooted in truth and strong principles. The man though, is revealed and abundant through their demonstration of these principles, wherein they apply them in and towards particular things. A common but good example is fitness. If your aim is centered on vanity, or relief from shame, then your actions will follow with these as the targets. If however your interest is the means to a sounder and fuller use of your time, then that robustness that you seek will serve as an equal target. Now, whether or not either of these is more founded and true, requires a great deal of clarity. Simply though, we could foreshadow that the reason we’d employ as to find what bore more truth, would surely treat us to a way of being which was rooted in regularity and substance. Therein, the man is one who does the thing which yields a more amendable and consistent profit, and thus he is more set and awarded towards the relevant means through demonstration. If that offer on his part is as such, then we can say that his orientation is sound. In other words, the proper way to be, or rather the richer values to have, are those which bear the most substantial and consistent gain.
        <br>&emsp;The real question though, is what things and activities bring out these interests? If robustness for example is the sounder aim, then the particular things which yield robustness are of equal claim -as the things which are congenial to our interest. Simply, if we thought about those values, and furthered our insight into the routes in which we could bring them out, then it ought to be as simple to inspect particular actions and measure their own natures and profit, then simply align those which fit the groove of our principles and aims. If we see then, that robustness is reached through smooth and plump training, as well as being done so consistently -as to be regular in reaching the target- then we might find that pushups are more wholesome and thus worthwhile (by their light yet sturdy nature) whereas benchpress, machines or closed chain weights, are more stiff and brittle, and thus offer less when it comes to ‘the open and tender efforts that robustness seeks’. Moreover then, could we say(in this case), that if pushups were congruent in the kind of action our interest needs, then the equal regularity required to maintain and keep those rewards, similarly makes that proper activity acceptable to be done regularly. The mark here of a man is that he was deliberate and well founded in his aim, sharp in his assessment of what was congenial, and prolific and true in his resolve to bring out the pairing. “Those are his roots.” The consequence of doing this across the board of the many aspects relevant to our lives, is a common place in which these things exist within the man, properly and true.
        <br>&emsp;A point worth drawing though, is in regard to the assessments. If our values are well placed and strong, then our grooves will be set for the best things. The things that fit well however, must be explored and explained themselves so that the auditions (so to speak) are made with accuracy. In other words, if our values are oriented in any given way, then their demands should be sharply met with proper and sound definitions of the viable suiters. “So we can find those who will treat our interests truly the best.” Thinking on these, is rooted in a request. Here, you are pleaing and inviting all those who are applicable and able to contribute. The greatest thing in the world is in the abundance of this congruence, whereby the widest set of values are tightly met and expressed. The wider our search then, to what is amiable and set to play the roles and meet our demanded parts, will allow for a more effective and substantial cast. Our goal then as a man -who is trying to bring himself foremost- is to conduct the most interviews, inquires, illustrations, assessments, remedies and smoothing of judgment, the removal of presumptions and assumptions, and the conduction of surveys, reflections, auditions, castings and or selections. From that, we will have seen and heard the world, and thus be further able to sensibly and steadily contribute the best ingredients into our recipe. “Wherein we can constantly bake the biggest, ripest, sharpest, freshest, greatest, beneficial and wonderful array and assortments of cakes, cookies and cream.” Here, we will be tasting the fullest and worthwhile treats.
        </div>
        <div id="direction">
        It feels here, that there is some poorly defined notion of what health needs. Your resolve to orient yourself around the demands -as to reach health - is commendable, but lacking something. Point in case, we can agree that your actions will have the final regard. If so, then our ends will vary based on the actions we place. Unless there is simply a measure of health -or any short number of things- then it may not be worth it to care. My feeling though is that even in the particular case of health, that the additional notion of longevity, feelings of robustness and strength etc., add considerable complexity and roundedness to your aim. "It is not that health should not be sought; moreover am I not saying that it should not simply be enough for you: but did you decide on it? Was it thought about with clarity and non-assumptions, then affirmed as a deliberate aim, or were you simply running away from misfeelings and grievance back onto what you thought you already knew."
        <br>&emsp;In other words, if we wish to feel robust regularly and well, then the actions that bring this out must be aimed at and adhered. Case in point though, only as much as we demonstrate these means to our interest, will our interest be brought out. Therein, will a lack of clarity to our aim, mean little consistency to what would actually offer us what we truly seek; moreso, will we be irregular in any demonstration at all. That irregularity rests simply on the case that despite even the shortest and base ambition, a sharp and clear aim for it will see a persistent target. If that aim -or more complex ones- lose their place as our interest, then our motivation and means for activity will flounder - and we will be left with none.
        <br>&emsp;My case and guidance then settles on the point of deliberation. What this amounts to, is merely being forward and concise about what you really seek, wherein the target and claim are both accurately pictured, and thus more prominently set for our active regard. So long as the consideration is active itself, can we say that we had a worthwhile and integrated target, for we thought of one, developed its intricacies, and choose it for ourselves. Furthermore, if the assignment for these gains is made for our effort to seek, then the draw will not only be placed onto something encouraging and swell, but wholeheartedly placed too -as we have an aim at all.
        </div>
        <div id="thetimes">
        I have wondered for some time why the things we think to be true are so with reason, or merit, and whether or not the workings beneath our assumptions and proposals are merely unaccounted for. More specifically, I wonder why it is for example, that being objective and elaborate within our intentions is proper when it comes to being ourselves. It does seem correct that if you are industrious, then your aim and figure of being so is best when it is formed thoroughly and with care. My question though is what does that entail in turns of our own action? In other words, "why does laying a stake that is congenial to us, offer a response that we will oblige? Why is it that simply being thoughtful and deliberate will produce a binding between intention and aims?" I think a reasonable point is that if our nature is a certain way, then our being so is likely common; in the same way that an energetic child bounces all around regardless of the scenario, our own benefit might be acquired in the same way as theirs. In that case, they would be better off if their energy was focused on things more productive and useful; in our own case, our industry would be improved if its application was onto something that A) merited and drew it prominently, and B) that the figure and form of this mold was one that allowed for a consistent amount of substantial offering. In other words, if the post which we'd place is aimed at us being more generous and contributive -in whichever natural regard- then it ought to be one that is more than a momentary thing. Even if the quality of a scenario or objective is ripe in its promise, the regularity in which we could participate marks the purer kind of success. When it comes to our energetic kid then, if we gave them something to do with the aim of honing their focus, but it was limited in both the amount they could actually offer, and moreso that its place as an objective was short in its lasting, then this would not solidify(for them), any form of lasting success. "Is that not what each of us desires, and hopes to accept -that our effort was thus proper, with a reward that was consequently one we were happy to acquire?"
        <br>&emsp;One of the things I believe is happening is that through the strength in our discoures, our ability to be actionable and placed where it is set, is more abundant and effective. The repercussion of this though is when you reach a point where you have expanded upon and furthered your goal and objective, you find yourself unsure of what is coming next. The cause of this seems to be remission from outside material, wherein a fumbling of your current expression leads to the fear that it will not improve: for the stresses from the world prod you to surpass them. This is a fairly rudimentary sentiment, as our real ability is baked in the constance of our achievements; here, the progress we make overlaps with previous efforts 'and we never find ourselves having finished, but withing nothing left that we wish to or are able to do'.
        <br>&emsp;As with most things, the center is hard to find. The initial point seems to always flank us from the rear, but infront I think there's good inline. At this place beyond, sits the world of potential. The unease and laxity I feel is in not knowing where we'll go, as well as a stiffness in proceeding because of that fear of idleness. What I actually suggest is a practice that is more malleable and set for you to comfortably proceed. At heart, much work has been done. Moreso, have these efforts been well founded and placed, as their demonstration was that of previous set intentions. What our goal now should be, is a layering of new objectives, wherein we properly set ourselves to add to those previous developments. Within this process is the reflection of what you have achieved so far, but this is merely sifting through and firming the present gains: the current objective is in seeing where they will be furthered towards, and in that is where we'll make for and aim.
        </div>
        <div id="life">
        Our circumstances can be engendered with rationality, as to make them more hospitable and better placed amongst the things which we actually seek. If the ground is more approved and leveled then the ability to do better things will be more clear and prominent - thus we are more open to that which we can imagine ourselves doing. From this, the aim can be our treat, and our circumstances can be valued for their means to these gains. Moreover, can we engage with those circumstances in a way in which they are in the realm of satisfaction, equaled by the claims in which they offer; from that, we are not only willing to oblige the tasks, but see them as acceptable points of contribution themselves.
        <br>&emsp;On our scenario and the many aspects that make its kind, are several things that make the mold: the state of yourself, and moreso your family and friends; your financial situation from investment and fortune, and equally, your place within basic income -and the role that follows. Additionally, are your prospects and ambition, wherein that scenario draws you out to improve the position, and thus the applicable motives that you seek. Lastly, and in similar heart to the most former(of yourself), is your training and readiness, or in other words, the state of your ground, in body and mind, words and nourishment; in contrast to that former, it has more weight on your feelings of contentment, or lack there off; this position, or aspect, is moreso in regards to your habits and practices -similar to a basic income, only from yourself and within.
        <br>&emsp;There are many of those scenarios within my life which worth discussing with respect to those parameters. When I was a child, in elementary school no less, compared to my intermediate years -before I had moved and family tension had risen. My secondary years from beginning to end, focusing foremost on the years later on -when drama and changes had also risen. The time that followed had little besides me, and the developments there were equal as such; however, these moments progressed into an honest exposure and expression from me into the common world, whereby I gained a great deal of maturity and confidence, although my ambitions and desires did not prevail -on which is worth reflecting on. Not lastly but most recently completed, are the more recent years and their root in responsibly developing; compared to our current state of being deliberate and generous, that previous stretch saw me shedding the past notions of necessary success, and personal aims based on my own prowess, and the feeling that I would be treated with a courteous response. From that time on, I had shed any ambition of being rewarded simply for who I am; now, as I am just that, I have learned why I should apply myself, for generosity and thus joy's sake. In that, I have seen the little that is required for me to be and flourish as myself - onto which I now venture and explore.
        <br>&emsp;All of these moments reflect periods of my life in which dramatic things were happening across the board. As I grew up and my character and knowledge was roughly put to the test, the nature of the world became more familiar, and I grew a continued insight into my lackings, and interest from being inside of it. Still to this day, do I not know, despite being well rested and rooted ahead. This current place of mine sees equal positions of uncertainty, as I make for my needs and satisfaction, amidst the similar experience of remission from duty, and gain of comfort as to ease my way. "I don't fear what is ahead, but I do repent at the fact that even though we have noteworthy and solid ambition, our place still isn't stilled and relishable, that we have no such notion."
        <br>&emsp;I think that in being myself, I see the means to do so even more and more. The developments and commission here though are very progressive, and outside the desires of those who merely wish to be more set; our place is in contrast to all who seek separation, and something exciting or new. I am not bogged down by much, and our contributions rise higher than the simple duties tasked onto me; moreso, do those duties provide the simple means to make such efforts, whereby I treat and offer my time wholeheartedly and with abundance - in and for myself. "It just seems like there's much more to go, and what this requires of me still remains a pressing burden."

        Plutarch remarks the fact that farmers seek shoots of corn which have begun to tip over, signifying that they are beginning to ripen and firm. He uses this notion to demonstrate the difference between students early on in their goal of philosophy, in that their ears and minds spring up as if drawn to the light from a dark abyss below; what he compares them to, are those of a more experienced and profitable kind, who have taken the light(so to speak) and dressed themselves in its brightness, wherein they themselves shine -as opposed to those who are eagerly drawn and perplexed. In other words, the firm and ready nature of a soul which has matured and solidified, is similar to the corn head that dips down under its own weight, whereas a light and air filled one sits thinly up.
        <br>&emsp;Regarding a scenario in which I find myself, is a contention I find with one of my neighbors, whereby their head is similarly light and sprung up, but lacking any of that weight or substance. For the sake of example, I would illustrate the difference between him and I, whereby the height of each of us reflects our stature and stability. Additionally though, I would add the trunk of the stock, wherein the point in which it crowns up or tips over, does so from the peaks of a varying height. For detail’s sake, I would say that my stalk is equal if not higher than my compatriot. The issue arises though, in that my crop is much firmer and sound, wherein my essence nestles itself below the tip of my foundedness. I like this and enjoy it. It reflects the fact that we have come and reached far, but are able to let it sink in, and actually give me the merriment and cheer I sought to gain. Contrasting this to my neighbor, his stalk is not so high; it is sound, and has some strength in its own right, but is explicitly the same(in its peak), if not lower. The disparity arrives when I consider that my crop -however dipped from its profit- still remains at the height of his own thinned peak. Consequently, I feel sometimes that even though I am more reticent and composed, that my power and embellishment still stretches further than his towering expression -or better said his perkiest one. In other words, at his strict and firm best, my solidified and rooted nature is still more prominent. “In other words, as I stand gently within myself, so too do we still meet eye to eye, in which he stands his tallest.”
        <br>&emsp;The contention arises in that my humblest and purest thoughts and claims have more prowess than his smug attitude. “He says very little, and cares little for inquiries -or to mine, a response.” He is not mean, but full of air, whereby an issue or judgment made on my part, is treated as though an obvious answer was present, of which he knew. “Its as if he believes he is already made, but does not act accordingly -for why would one so well off be so hidden yet smug?” My feeling is he is more satisfied with himself, as opposed to having any fidelity in what he actually does. “In that would there be actual conversation.” The reason is in his fortune and sophistry, rather than a cheered reverence, or integrity to and towards aims based through rationality. This is all judgment outside my care to refute -for I mean not to penalize or be critical, as his nature is not my business. My simple regard for the matter rests merely on the fact that we struggle with getting along. Nothing is hostile between us, and despite any stillness in our relationship, a friendly acceptance of the other is present. I wish there was more though, but he seeks so little. I, who seeks and resolve to much, can find more peace and happiness in assessing stations more accurately. I don’t say or sound too much in times which were better set to be brief and little; or, if I have something personal to share, or some interest or experience that I could relate to him about and ask, then I do so when it is appropriate and fair -whereby a heartier discussion would be more relevant and acceptable. “I guess it is just hard to sink in and actually incorporate the richness of your rational gain, yet still be yourself amongst those who sit high and hollow.” Because the former is most preferable, as well as being right in it’s favor, then against that friction and corresponding isolation, will I affirm the better. “For I can then keep to that.”

        That is not what I think any longer. Instead, I believe our roots have changed to what they would have been before the uprising of our current culture: and onto that marks the fact that we are set for a better claim. What this means is that our interests and worries are not made from the front of our present line. In that case, civilization has been developing and our values within it have advanced correspondingly. I see much that has resulted poorly, in that we are no longer deliberate, but moreso is the simple fact that what we wish for and hope to avoid is wrong. We have not personally changed, and the medium that dictates the things offering has explicitly remained. What I intend is to accomplish a bevy of industrious and philosophical results through the means of deliberation, reverence and care. No more will I rest outside and dangle my hopes that something good will happen from me being so. It is in that composure of greatness, that my active embrace and expression of it is demanded and helmed by me. To those though who are already present, can I say that my aim is not to directly provide, but be myself. Therein, my place as a member amongst people shines a light from me being a great one of the kind: in that, will those of the group be treated from my own gains.
        <br>&emsp;It is simply the case that those who do poorly in this world A) do so at their own fallibility, and B) make little use of the success they have. In that, even those at the top of the rubble still fall down. This is because there is no thoughtfulness or care onto what we seek and require, as well as how we hold ourselves through and upon the results. The lock to the door then is out of order, 'and we are bent towards a poor experience regardless of our wellness within our values'. In other words, even if we do well, our profits will swell because we poorly use them. Forewardly then would I say that onto all results that they require some aspect of reason and virtue.
        <br>&emsp;However, what this suggests is that if all of our results our only made proper within the presence of those qualities, then the effect of those attributes being part of our own composure has its own primary effects. Put another way, the necessity of reason is onto the use of our gains -of all kinds that is. Furthermore, would we say that the strength and constant abundance of reason would allow the good we get to persist: in that case, there is a forever need for reason so long as we wish to be more genuinely well. The effect rooted in the nature of this claim is that the presence of reason will also determine the results -alongside helping us make use of them. "It is as if our profits were reasonably set and equally gained. Wherein the former reflects the way and stake of our obtainment, and the latter reflects the incorporation and settlement from achievement -of which the process is advanced continually."
        <br>&emsp;In short, the need for a result to be truly good is that it is made an actual accomplishment: therein, would winning the lottery and wasting all the money not earn you that much, whereas being given a little that you make a great use of reflect a sound reward. It is reason which achieves the latter. The stock within reason then -for the sake of accomplishment- consequently alters our gaze. If this is truly so, then our need to case our gains within the reason also demands (as I suppose, and mean to propose) that the marker that is set also be forged from a similar kind of care. In other words, the thoughtfulness and attention required to proceed from a point of accomplishment, suggests that that point be reached from an equal kind of gaze; moreover, does this bear strength in that our wish to accomplish more be rooted from the purity of our achievements thus far: and onto those gains which were made genuine through reason, would the advance from there not include the present disposition? Or in more simple terms, if reason is the demand for us to truly win, then is it not comparably bound for us to set the objective, as well as plan the attack? "Should we not live within reason if our results are only made sound within its use? I would say then that better aims could be met and genuinely accomplished using a similar sentiment of care. And with respect to our culture then, will these kinds of effort and resolve contrast its own ill deliberate and assuming process"

        <div id="ofentirety">
        I could be better off to write this, but the notion is too ripe to wait. Or, rather, it is so pure and true what I wish to suggest, that it would retain merit and strength within my drunken treatment. What that sentiment reflects is the core theory of humanity thus far -at least that which has till this point been proposed. In ancient Greece, the renowned philosopher Plato -who is the hallmark, though to my knowledge less so than Aristotle- put forth the Allegory of the Cave. Within this depiction, he illustrated a scene wherein a light cast a shadow from behind those who would see it, whereby the impression was taken from the images flickering on the wall infront. What his point was is not strictly the place I mean to attend. For the sake of argument, we can summarize it as Man not knowing what true reality is -in some way respecting the later developed idealism of the 18th century. This may be true and, consequently, has prolonged itself as the figure that best reflects our intellect (and its limits). I have my own proposal though: and it is from my place outside of the cave.
        <br>&emsp;The stretch between these two depictions is not my concern to strictly define, at least in this situation. What I would venture to put forth is the nature of the lands outside of this cavern of ignorance. In this area, the air is open and we are truly free. The weight of it though does shoulder you with an overwhelming sense of both the frailness of things and our limits in being present. That last point perhaps provides the difference, in that those who are ignorant have no sense that they are, whereas those who are out in the open at least realize that their impressions are muddied. What I wish to say though more prominently is about our time and being in this open space. Here, we are imbued with the utmost expressions of the world and all of entirety. “It is the fact that the cave, being a metaphor so to speak, manifests itself in reality within the measure of your openness and ability to acquire the unbridled experience that reflects the nature of reality. In other words, if you are seeing it all, then you are not in the cave.”
        <br>&emsp;That being said, our time in this vast expanse can be paralyzing. Initially, at least, it can be unsettling to know how big things are and, relatively speaking, how little we are in comparison. Moreso, does the cause and reason for these things operating as they do, and moreso to our purpose and need to treat them burden us with indecisiveness and the fear that follows. There is a resolve though, and I wish to and mean to profess it. My feeling however is that our place in this very moment may not be sharp enough or able to illustrate and assess the proper thinking that reflects the weight of this situation. Moreso, would the principle which I stand on suggest that our advocacy be based purely on strength; and, equally then, do I and would I suppose that this means that our claim sits outside of the certainty that those in shock fearfully request. “It may simply be the case that unless I can elaborate onto the figure of this sentiment in the roundest way, and then further examine and assess the particular things relevant to us and how they should be treated (from this figure of values), may beckon me to be weary onto our offerings, as well as our own expectations of what this foremost place of thinking provides -considering our shrillness to work boldly yet tenderly within our limits.”
        <br>&emsp;What this is remarks the fact, again, that we are limited. What it entails though is that we are at best going to look up at the stars, and that this should suffice within the claims of the stair. It is in that impression wherein we are drawn out to feel and see, that we hold ourselves higher than we would if the floor had our gaze. In that upward turn we rise, building ourselves up through our industrious inspection. “That’s what being an Architect means. Whereas a civil engineer aims at the clearest and straightest cut for his development, the man of reverence and care strikes bold and higher, wishing to reach the stars through his momentous production. In that, he is simply that one who is in the world and earns his part: in that, he is limited, but happily declared to his mere ability to then appreciate and tribute.”

        <div id="thetree">
        Up on the hill there sits a tree. On this bank of ours, we have toiled the soil as to be rich and nourishing, wherein the roots can dig and hold deep, allowing the trunk to grow strong and firm. As well, that pillar supports itself through the sap it produces, ‘as if the pores from our solidity break out of the mold and harden the edge’. At the bottom of the rise, flows a stream. On and on it will go, though our limits suggest its presence will be temporary when it comes to us. Making haste, we labor the steps and stones, to bring back the means for nourishment and drink. In doing so, the tree becomes well founded and tall. As it grows higher and true, it takes in more of the sun’s rays, ‘whereby the development process is cemented, and it is set to continue being and becoming strong’.
        <br>&emsp;The light on offer gives an impression, of all that is green and gold. This interest and draw brings us out of our casing, whereby the tree blooms towards the sun and her ways. Moreover, if we are stably treated to this creation of ours, then we can take the little we need from it, and re-invest for more future gains. This contribution proceeds into the addition of branches, as extensions; here, more room for fruit and leaves are available for that rigor coming in and the roots beneath to flourish and generate something great and wonderful.
        <br>&emsp;As we take the fruit and bloom of these offerings, several things happen. The value in supporting the system becomes meritable and worthwhile, whereby the access to the stream becomes ripe for industry and effective development; moreso, will you as a person and agent become kind and amenable to what those means take. As an agent who has a limit, your regard can sprout from these grounds, wherein they mold themselves to the path rooted in this way; here, the offer is forever and light, whilst the lesser weight allows you to further contribute as well as personally being more. It is that most latter that reflects the purest ambition. As someone, being well ordered and tuned is a principle cause and demand; in doing so well, the need for its doing becomes proficiently met, ‘and the way is leveled’. In this space of grace and stability, you may offer yourself to things more liberal and of study. Beyond the point of the green in your pasture, is the expression and bound of one who has improved from its nectar. In other words, the goods you have received from the forest and the stream, allow you to be actionable onto things and activities in and for themselves. “It is of the greatest claim in which a mind and body has the most prolific and joyous experience.”
        <br>&emsp;Regularly and round, will the reach and make for these ends of your development treat you to a place that bears prominence in its offering. “Whereby the flourishing and blooming state of your heart and soul dances and sings as far and high as you can push it.” From this, your experience will relate to the congruency and fecundity of the tree. In that case, the ground holds the offer, wherein the roots and trunk stake themselves deep within; the leaves and the canopy flutter ever more to the top as the base becomes better set below. “Thus you are given the sturdy grounds for your own personal offering.”
        <br>&emsp;More than the additions and tribute to the tree and stream, your real take from this stability is that your interest and aims can set themselves to be infinitely higher. Whereas the trunk sits firmly on the grounds of the earth -wherein it can hold the nourishment that other things need- you can take its treatment and apply it forwardly, onto and for yourself. In that, the peaks will be ever more prominent, ‘as the sky and your dreams carry you as high and far as you can treat them, whereby you pillow and bloom, like the cloud’. In that, I will illustrate the difference. Whereas the tree will bloom outwards and with solidity as it gains permanence and care, you will shoot upwards and far, growing lightly and tremendous the more you put in. “Whereas one is bolted into and smothering the ground as it grows, your mind and achievement fills up and covers the open air, whereby the cloud of joy and feeling ease expands and balloons equal to and as much as you throw in.” In that last case, we are measuring ourselves through prominence, rather than completion.

        <div id="natured">
        I have explicitly realized that our goal is not to reach further fortunes, or even find more riches and green in our pasture: it is simply and merely the case that we must clarify, expound and expand, decipher and decide, strictly and wholeheartedly explain all the means of our time in being, wherein we deliberately and forewardly define our home and aim. To the former, I mean the overview and assessment of the world and what it needs from me. We are industrious and rational creatures of course, and our actions as animals will be to respond and oblige to what seems posative; delivering a more accurate picture that illustrates the spots and holes in which we must and or should place our effort, marks the truth in our base foundation: on that, our house is both sturdily and comfortably built. I bring up that latter aspect because of the discontent one can have on wishing for something they cannot obtain; the feelings of failure and remission here can be removed and reinstated with more warmth and delight instead by seeing what the world and our place in it truly means, wherein the clarity of what is sound in our expectations becomes more prominent; consequently, we are not hopefull for things which have no real bearing and are not dissapointed without their possesion. In other words, bringing ourselves inline to an accurate portrayal of the world, will give us the means to a better end. Our goal then when it comes to this ground and its furnishings, is to be well placed in our assessments so that our actions are congengial to the truth: the congruency of which will then yeild the strongest claim. For reality is the utmost and thus our alignment and reverence to it will bear the furthest offer -for it is able to give the most, and equally then of value to treat.
        <br>&emsp;Why are we building this house though, or tending to this land? Ontologically we are ones set to have an experience; here, a point can be drawn that this production and toil can and does yeild a measure of that; is it the ripest and well met way though? My suspicion is not. Foremost, is the regard for that measure and what it would be best to yeild. As ones who live and are actionable [at this point we will say regardless of kind], then, ideally speaking, the ripest and most explicitly posative form is where the metric lives. Effecitvely, this reflects one who is totally invested, whereby their draw to fundamentals, or study, craft and other applied fields, is so high that they willingly and happily through themselves in. This rich and active participation means joy in the moment; across a stretch or period of time, we are said to be flourishing; when the solidity of our means and engagment is levelled as to enable us to be involved in this way in a consistent and prolific matter, then we can be regarded as propserous. This configuration marks the highest make, and in other words the fruits of one who is fully intouch and expereincing their rooted selves. The question though for man is beyond the admittance of his possession of a nature, or whether it is congruency which should then be met for that reason of flourishing, prosperity and joy. Mans troubles and problems are beyond this: for one who is in reality natured, is always working this way. It is merely the fact that what he thinks is time intended to improve something outside his core nature, is really a markedly false and error filled approach sprouting from his true essence." Admittedly though, that is hard to explain.
        <br>&emsp;It is the effort of man when it is not aimed at congruence to truth and his real ability to do so, that muddies his profits and result."To be ignorant of your nature is most false when your nature is the mould of reason and inquiry."
        <br>&emsp;Plainly said, it is how man uses and ordains his effort and care that solidifes and realizes the gains and use of his time; doing so then reflects the utmost need, for as ones with natures and, moreso, reasons to treat them, the specifics and pecularities of that mark our only regard -for this is where the dance between the world and our behaviours live. And onto that is where propiety and congeniality lie -whom of which guard and rule our means to a life of tranquil serenity.
        <br>&emsp;Adding to that, could 'a figure' help us illustrte the point of clarity within our foreward intentions. Given the congruence of reality and our nature, the active essence of this needs a mold; here, the generous effort which our congeniality is demonstrated in, has a place to go. Strictly put, the regard of one who is trying to live well through respecting their rooted inclinations, will deliver and sculpt the figure and form of the thing and place that they mean to and intend to express. Therein, the agent will have both a canvas rooted in ontology and ethics, but equally the scriblings of possible production and design. "Its quite simple you see; if ones personal tendency was to write, then writing well would encompass the sharp abundance of their efforts: to do so though is not merely achieved." I believe the case in point is in the whole idea itself. If the thing which will offer us the most posative expereince is defined by that which houses our largest effort, then the means for those efforts to be demonstrated and produced is the thing of our highest regard. The borders of our land are in our thoughtfullness, wherein our base needs are moulded and set to a proper view of the enivronment; additionally, is our spiritual and reverent guide born from the forefront of this -where we discover and learn what it means to flourish and thrive. Following this though, we can say that worry and regret is only onto the foremost thing, and that is our regard for what and how we will be onto the greatest end -and this reflects the need to mark the target and kind, wherein the attention we place is born from our nature and intracies.
        </div>
        <div id="prominence">
        Some time ago I mentioned the fact that those maturing would lose their nature upon maturity. The reason being, that once they were in line and set within the world, their actions would become congruently engrained, 'asking nothing from you'. What I said, was that if you were to thrive and prosper, then you must be deliberate and stout, whereby the constancy of doing so would leave the proper being to perpetually carry itself. I think that the word nature suggests a tendency, as if you were made to do it but effectively propped somewhere else. What I mean currently, is that having a nature calls on you to treat it well so that your actions are rewarding and soundly made. Foremost, must you recognize and consider all of your many intricacies, and treat them as if they are your priority. The mention of maturity before, is merely made on the grounds that this process is removed when the actions are no longer led down this course, and are instead housed there already.
        <br>&emsp;Practically speaking, can we say that as a being, you are in one of two states. The completed sense reflects that fact, whereby you are forever set and made -wherein the proper actions and congeniality have been dug out and bolted in. Secondly is our developing state. This situation marks the common norm, for we are in most cases less than who we fully are. The reason for this dialogue is to promote this fact, that we are ones with peculiarities and need of proper treatment. If we have squeezed out all but who we are within our behaviors and mind, then the mode we are in will continue soundly and with subsequence. If our nature is still present, then we must order ourselves and maintain our effort and time through that.
        <br>&emsp;I would like to speak to what that means, but I will propose something first. As animals, we are set in a relevant way; this set is limited, even as we are as men with tools and tech. "We all will at this point die. " The strength to the remnant of our need to then be responsible is fashioned in this natured manner; here, the resting point is that so long as our nature remains, so will our need to beckon; or, otherwise, if we grow out of it, it will be reasonable to suppose that this was from the prior steps wherein the nature was treated, 'whereby it is now fully entrenched and engrained and then offering a more furnished and complete set of which the previous developments were procuring'. In that, my point is that with the nature that we have now, will our use and treatment of that merely grow into a point of solidity, rather than removing the need for being natured at all. To reiterate, a nature is a bearing, a root of kinds and related tendencies; we say the one who is owning this and making it true, is mature and developing, and we say that one who has completed their quest and confirmed their essence with reality thick and through, will be regarded as mature and complete. For example, one with a talent for woodwork, will not lose their skills and use of them upon the point of mastery. In some sense, the steps of improvement are then no longer made, and you purely exist as one who is fully able to be.
        <br>&emsp;I must think on this and clarify the terms even more, but I can say that my target is the solidity of our nature's continuity. We can say that our bodies can forever remain; moreover is it feasible to suggest that our minds will keep going forever to. But what concerns me, is that even though all challenge and distress can be parlayed, so will our natures remain. The need for my focus here is to complete the sentiment from the ground up, giving regard for contentions and noncrucial aspects. What I can say however, and where the strength in this notion lies, is that for positivity to be claimed, then our existence as ones who are immortal and powerfully tuned, will our experience and time still be sensitive to our participation in it: Foremost then, must we uncover and decide, that if our nature will always be as one and remain, then the teller of good living and positive experience. will require and be made in our proper treatment of that. "Conclusively, does it then seem like our state will at best be one of prominence, however perpetual: for in all our greatest fortunes and maturity, ought we still be, or live that is?
        </div>
        <div id="existence">
        Underneath all of me there rests what I would through inquiry discern as existence, by the phrase ontology. My firmness and strength would reflect the development of my measure to be rooted and in accord with what that reality is, and our view and advance forward(with this accuracy) marks the presence of ethics. Moreover, as you bring yourself out into the world with this sounder scale, your disposition becomes more sharply molded to the world as it really is. On the flipside, are the wears and tears of one who did not but hopes to live this way. Growing up, if you have not been either thoughtful in making an objective, or successful and achieving the one you actually had, then your retreat into rational sobriety is barred with a natural impasse. Foremost is the fact that your aim has no bearing for it has not been developed at all; moreso, have your previous gains led you to a place in which you'd like to return, and this does not imply a state in which you are in the best position to newly define and then resolve to achieve. In other words, the strain and stress of common living cause friction towards a sounder objective and its advancement. Personally, I have never lived in a targeted space whereby outward and thoughtless aims were the objective set. My internal aims however and the goals that followed, were not completely whole in their intention, and having reached a place where the excess fat(so to speak) has been rendered off, my trajectory is still not as solid and firm. As one who is trying to be more deliberate and considerate, my advice is to take the shortest route and make for this lane with consistency and haste -for it in some sense is your new objective. Equally, as I would reflect on the way in which my purer place can be further embellished and sharpened, you can use a similar approach within your early progress as a more mature and promising form and technique. How one returns to a place of good and nature is preliminary by definition. "What I am looking for is how to hold the edge and sprout from here."
        <br>&emsp;From the ground up, the first principle is in owning the fact that you have a nature. Ontologically this is so if you can think and inquire -reflecting the fact that you are limited, and with somewhere to go - and theologically, means your end will be equal to the rest, as a tranquil and calming experience -like a deep sleep. Moreover, does having a nature reflect the need for proper aims and disposition. The principle here is twofold and holds our ethic. First, is regarding the fact that having a nature means that there is a congenial way rooted in how it is set, and is thus a harmony which is prime for you to flourish in being congruent to that. Secondly, is removing vanity(as learned or immaturely developed); this means that your expectations and interest are rooted in the actual demonstration of your effort and production, as well as the value made and provided. Vanity in contrast, is foremost when you anticipate a profit or reward based on what you have done or who you simply are; in other words, you imagine that things will positively happen before the activity is actually done, or based on an expected view born from self-importance. Simply put, if we as creatures of industry and abundance seek to obtain the means and rewards from doing so, then we must root ourselves in the hopes and ambition of meeting so, through actually doing so, rather than because we can.
        <br>&emsp;Shielding all of this is the real world. Underneath our purest reflections are those insights of reality and existence, and the knowledge gained which helps us develop stronger and opportune values and interests. Outside of this though is that real world. Only, that in front of us it rests in a malleable state, whereby our new instruments of interest and measure can be put to the test, or better yet used as material for our fuel as a sculptor. In doing so, our access to knowledge and inspection will be further made available, updating and improving our past notions of who we are and what we should seek, as well as existence's more accurate hold and housing, and all that this is set to expect and demand from me. Here, we can further our resolve, becoming more congruent with what actually fits our needs and treatment.

        There is so much to say. I felt before that we were open and free, and set only with a resolve to consider and mend in and towards the truth. That understanding seems less important now. For example, I have attested to a grand piece of work, of which always seemed placed in front of less important work -as though it were the peak from those previous efforts. Now, since we are tasked with obligations and duties immediately, it feels as though our reason for meeting them should be sought and taken equally. In other words, instead of the past notions of letting things develop naturally, our way now is better set on a more firm and founded experience. In doing so, we can apply the reason and strength in which we have become composed.
        <br>&emsp;Foremost, is the clarity and development of our goals into aims. On this, I simply mean the smoothing out of rough edges, and deepening of our intentions and gaze. Put another way, the thing we truly wish to do should be dealt with clarity and unravelment, as to be more prominent in our reasoning for supporting the means to do at all. In that case, our duties will not be so draining, for a larger and well-rounded claim is clearly seen. Compared to a wider yet lighter approach, wherein the ease of life is tended to -and those activities and aims that follow- our position now is one that invites more firm and deliberate time and attention. In doing so, the tasks and demands placed far in front of us will have a truer and sounder gain to keep us going through. Moreover, will our despair of having to be responsible and dutied be more agreeable -for the reason of congruence is better said and explained.
        <br>&emsp;The mere mention of all and any aim seriously expands and embellishes the very means which support it. "Those which offer such, and in other words provide, make the overall harmony of asks and claims congenial to one another, and thus more easily amended." The advice I would give is to see the floor as if it were properly swept. The space is still what it is, and your request to be a participant is no lesser, but your view of the lane is more kept and tidy -if the condition is positively arranged. In seeing the way as it is in a sharpened condition, you can be accurately oriented. In seeing the place in which you are set, the groove for its offering is ripe and ready for development and contribution. That sentiment is truly the one in which reasonable happiness and effortless joy follow. In seeping yourself in it wholeheartedly, the aims and interest that you really seek will employ and incentivize you to provide and nourish them through the duties and responsibilities that are there for this end.

        <div id="kingsgame">
        Objective truth is the hardest thing to come by. Having not known, I can at least say that my interest is in reflecting on and defining myself as a man. Not a dog or a fish, or a god or something high and absolute; merely one who can reflect, and admires oneself and roots their reverence as such, as one who is seemingly born yet explicitly made for thinking and inquiry -for it is what I am doing right now.
        <br>&emsp;The problem lies in trajectory. Actions, need a value for their prevalence to have any real stake, and declaring what that is fairs us a very tricky task. Moreso, am I unsure what it is we even need. "The adage goes that a king will ignore his council's plea, as well as his citizens suffering because no problem is in the way of what he seeks: he is already king." How I improve upon this though, is by deflecting the repercussions of that decision. In other words, by seeing it for what it really is, we can say that this direction for the king will ultimately prove to be unfavorable and bad. My motivation however in revealing the cracks in the pillar is rooted in the experience I have had that is beyond what the King is arrogantly seeing as good. From the ground up, we could use a different example of one who enjoys to drink and dine; reflecting on their satisfaction shows us that the consequences seen through wisdom are understandably shadowed by the wall of pleasures currently around. More concisely, the king in his case, is relishing his power and post -and all that brings. Wisdom suggests that the realm will at one time revolt -and those happenings are not so pleasant, of which our wisdom pleas to suggest. I do not stand firmly here though. My insight is similar to those who would see the natural consequence ahead, but I see something more promising elsewhere.
        <br>&emsp;Simply put, my position is struck in the place of the foremost experience. In that, my pleas against the King(if I had the time to be positively suggestive) is that before his naivety lands him in revolt and despair, that he ask himself whether the fortunes and desires he would otherwise fair -and subsequently cause that clout of mind- are worth it themselves, regardless of the consequence or not. In other words, the proposition of further gains is rooted in the purity of achievement. Moreover, is that success found in a greener pasture, 'whereby you relish and experience the strength and solidity of your heart and soul'. The specifics are to be applied after this discernment, but onto that latter we can boldly say (to the king) that the best and greatest times and feelings that you have, are higher and bolted above, wherein your own decency and effort bring you to flourish and flow with joy.
        <br>&emsp;My only point then, is that to this retched man who sits drunk and clueless, that rather than meet the unduly consequences, or tame yourself as to be more reticent and wise, that you hold yourself to something further and positive, whereby the risk of conflict and trouble are equally removed. "Nor will you have to be boring and wise: simply live for something higher and more."
        </div>
        <div id="thephilosopher">
        The reason is with respect to the gain of our progress. When we settle into ourselves, it is generally because the goods we seek are found personally, rather than from something outside. It is not that those things offer little, no; rather, the claims which bear us the most are of the kinds which are fuller and well founded, regular and abundant. “Those things which truly enrich our soul and hearts.” Things like sex, wealth and fame, these things are rewarding in the same way as medicines are helpful: they are specific in their effects based on the kind employed, and despite being substantial in what they particularly offer, only their presence can bear it so, and otherwise seeps the contribution if they no longer remain. These goods are at heart inconsistent and narrow, however high.
        <br>&emsp;In contrast, are those goods of reason. These aims come from things that are more rounded, as they come from and stay with you. For example, the respect and cheer brought from the world and her mold, burrows itself into you forever, for she is always there; moreso, the essence and workings of your mind are ripe for inquiry and appeal in any sort of place, be it of beauty or of horror. Moreover and ultimately, the contemplation and regard for the sameness and ease by which we reach and experience death, soothes any with a relevant nature to that. “In which they’d necessarily care.”
        <br>&emsp;The point I am trying to make is that the goods we seek, come from the congruence to the proper mold. Those completely within themselves are not doing this; they are removing the intrigue and grip from their senses as to be without the world and instead within. This is fine, preferable in some ways even, but besides the path of the rational animal. “The real way is one in which our mind and bearings are set towards the clarity and definitions set by it. Ought there be action though?” We are not trying to be clear as not to think, moreover are we not trying to be clear as to acquire the gains of our previous dullness; we are merely twisting our gaze as to be more congenial and set, so that we may bring ourselves more steadily and fair, whereby the treats of the world and our own generous posture can act and receive the contributions from the other. From there, there is a bliss harmony, for each is heard and treated.
        <br>&emsp;In summary, the ways of those foolish is too inconsistent and tough for me to have their aim; the ways of those without their senses, however removed from those foolish joys and ambition, have but merely rest: they are not living. “Is it not actions which we mean when we try and describe our lives.” My aim is one where I am contributing and thus living the most. This cannot be done to women, missions and or glorious claims, no; it is in art, literature, industry and me. “It is the forge of my soul and its strike from the brain that bears the widest and fullest path, wherein I am flourishing and robust, regularly until I drift away.” The point therein which I’d reach is what guides me, for it is the root of all concerns regarding this medium. As the agent and maker of strength in our time, it is my pleasure and friend to know such ends, for it means then that the means can proceed uninhibited, for we are unafraid and thus able to positively be. “Ought we step forward and firm though? Being still no matter the ease nor the ill founded bounds ahead seem to meet that standard. Let it be in actions bound towards our expected death, but happily, fully and well: for we are neither afraid or lacking wholesome ability."
        </div>
        <div id="truth">
        Our idea of things may be absolute, in that it is founded well and all-encompassing, but at the same time, be rugged and half cooked. For example, if we know how everything is, and in what way it proceeds, our impression and grasp on this may only be part way; in that, our view and stance on what is foremost is partial, even though it is of the utmost. In contrast, we may have a solid grasp on something, but it is of something smaller and less encompassing. In other words, we may have a lighter view of the world and our aims but be well entrenched and settled into its resolve. What we must regard then, is whether it pays to be forward but bare, or smaller yet firm; my feeling is that each state will become the other, as a point ahead which appeared to have more of an offer, will sooner or later become the place in which we strive from; moreso then, will the point in which we'd we reach if we were absolute, rest on a simpler point in which it is approached from. To all of that, we should be inclined to set forth, and move with height in our aims and stake, but relish the path easily, as we sit on the steps before the ones seen ahead.
        </div>
        <div id="inquiry">
        The fundamental point of inquiry is to whether the nature of your impression ought to be sifted through the lens of one who is or has inquired. Put another way, if you are making progress within your knowledge of the world, would the imperfection that correlates also render the proceeding results somewhat impure? In other words, if your knowledge is incomplete, will that alter the assessments ahead? Prominently, the nature of inquiry suggests that our register is not complete; if it were, there would be no inquiry, or need rather.
        <br>&emsp;That being said, if it is the case that our developments are made from points of lesser status, then the regard we have for those progressing, should be done with respect to that. There seems to be a necessary hunch based on our essence of not yet knowing; you could imagine that if everything was understood and known, then the truest and fullest assessment and judgment could be made. I feel though, as in most things, that this presumption rests on the pretension that we already know, and are just trying to find it as if we already contained the mark. The whole point of these distinctions, is that the mark is not ultimately known, for you have not reached the point in which you could. In other words, the aim of all things cannot be known until you have reached it; this is not to say that retrospect is required, but familiarity with something specifically, does suggest that you already know what it is - by virtue of knowing it with exactness.
        <br>&emsp;The question then is how we should be. My feeling is that this needs a more robust understanding and cleanse of our own nature of inquiry. Simply put, were are complexes of smaller things, by which we see other complexes; these impressions treat us to an understanding based on the essence of our senses: Our impression of the world is with respect to the figure we see of the things and their expression. It is the thing that hears and feels that heeds those around, grounding itself as the thing which we are rooted in, as to be our own personal vessel and mold of the world. In theory, there is a necessary hunch to this - as we are merely constructing a better image. At heart though, the point of understanding this is to help pasteurize our pretensions that we were made for something more. "Why is painting enough? Would our natures and thus actions remain, even if we had all things sculpted down to the tiniest bits of clay? Sure it may be useful to have some grasp, but won't it always reach a receding point based on what is useful for us?"
        <br>&emsp;It is as if the presence of inquiry entails that there is something we do not yet know; it seems that this inclination materializes in the need to know it. Hunch Theory is effectively the notion that if you know enough, you would not need to know at all. Effectively, if you knew that the correct way was likely, then bending yourself to the nature of that conclusion would yield the proper course. I believe our nature as progressive inquirers, leads us to a point where we can trust what we believe the most to be true; it is however the case, that this solution does not lead to more worry and concern, for I believe that the truth in this path is helmed through maturity; moreso, does its resolve relieve us of any ultimate need, as it soundly suggests that our being is explicitly temporary. "Since the well founded response is to merely meet this, as the end is known and being actionable is all we can do, treats us pleasingly and without remission. "For is there any need to then question what we should do? If so, would proceeding gently and expressively not reflect at least a kind of favorable way? Why ought there be more though?"
        </div>
        <div id="advancment">
        The issue we are facing, like all inquirers, is developing experience with something, and thus deriving its merits and claim from reflection. Here, values are developed as we consider what it is we like, as it had been and what we are interested in moving toward; from that, it is the most important factor that we engage in things and derive our constance through the result. On the flipside, we may look forward from the starting point of what would be good -in a theoretical sense. In these cases, some aim or value is tributed as being whole and founded, and thus the kind of result we should seek. The issue foremost, is that this does not consist of any clear road of what things will offer in this way. It is possible to discern that great riches will be profitable in the desired aspects, but this presumes to know what great riches are. If we had great riches already, then we could say which aspects of their nature were worth avoiding and seeking. "Yet how would we otherwise not assume that being King was what this amounted to? For is that not what great riches are?" In our previous case though, someone has a view of things based on expectations placed from their starting position; moving from there, they may reach that point, but find out that it did not hold the gains they were seeking. That is the heart of the problem, 'for seeking the crown may otherwise be foolish'.
        <br>&emsp;The issue is that they had a deliberate gaze, and were seeking what would constitute a good life; in that resolve, they pursued things with respect to that but were ignorant to the nature of those things as they were when viewed from that point of successful experience. Put another way, if we straighten up and become wiser in what we seek, then we must also suspend our judgment of what things mean until we reach the point in which a stronger ground for assessment can be made; in other words, if your idea of gold and fear is born out of a view based on your current scenario, then the aim of those things will be based on an assessment that is rooted from a lesser place -in that is was prior. It is wise to be set in the kind of life you want to be, but it is folly, naive at least, to assume what things and ambitions are with respect to our bias and foresight.
        <br>&emsp;The reason for saying this is to remedy this mistake of presuming that things will fall in accord with our beliefs of them. Instead, we should acknowledge what we know already and let that be the mechanism that guides us further. That is, if we reflect upon our experience thus far, then tailor an insight into how we want to be. "Knowing this will thus give us a personal criteria for where we want to be." For example, if we realized that we were full of ill prudence and regret, then our goal should be to mend ourselves, seeing then what the world seemed with respect to that. Simply, we could look at someone drunk and the lens of their inquiry being all murky; it would not be foolish to sober up and pursue better things, but any impression you had of things in that previous state would not be legitimate as an aim. Our natural progression is headed straight forward, and thus the meaning of things can be more sound as their relation is to a constant path. Compare this to our initial route, wherein we were bound to turn around: the definition of things from that path, are not well founded -or likely round- as they were based on a lens which was poorly oriented.
        <br>&emsp;The advice I would give then is to orient yourself when it comes to the core of your actions and aims. Removing rusty interests and ambition, settle into yourself and find the possibility of a sounder claim. Taking steps from there will see all things that come your way be sifted through a stronger measure, allowing for more substantial profits. In mending your own being as to be congruent and set, then your development will hold things with a proper hand, as they are held and needed to reach a sounder target, born from your newly founded aim.
        </div>
        <div id="reproach">
        As for the most prominent and ill-found question, is how we should spend our time. If we truly could know, then this would be the highest claim within our ability to reach anything at all. To what that measure can bring, here is how it is found. Rooted in our nature is a lineage of not yet having known; more and more do we acquire, but we are never fully grown. “Not till we knew it all could we say what all is, and thus our assertions and claims are partially ill-founded, for we have not yet reached a point whereby we could stand firm onto absolute gains.” From this, we will presume our nature. As our first principle, we can easily address the proper route, and thus response -wherein our highest claim is reached. This is simply the case, whereby our knowledge of what is, becomes so much that we are confident in knowing what it is like to be besides all, and with not. In contrast to knowing all and thus making an absolute claim, we can at least be well founded in our place with nothing. “Only those who will be all should and can reach a point where this point is known. For those who will return to lesser points, our goal should be the remedy of striving to live as if we were otherwise, but remove the fear of being unknown instead, and thus rest merely on the notion that all will be fine, for the ground floor of nothing bears our only claim.”
        <br>&emsp;My resolve that is from this is simply to confess the ignorance we have, of not yet knowing how much it is we do not know. “Firmly, my place is one where ‘nothing’ has the aim: for I am set apart from all things other.” Otherwise, we will be restled in acquiring more, and resolve ourselves into the means of reaching full enlightenment. People like this are issued an all too founded find, and consequently have little strength in the position that they seek. Instead, my resolve as from and to matruity’s treat is to bring that stake closer to ourselves; in doing so, the firmness and shape can be solid and rounded, smoothing itself out towards a finer claim: that purer gain is the root of our target. Knowing enough, we are then aware of our ability to even know so little. Upon our understanding of that, will our eye retreat towards the grass and pastures of our soul, happily accepting its place as one who is meant to simply graze. Moreso does this point treat those who are made for it, with a grand and oathfull flourishing, for this is congruent to them if their nature be as such, and thus they are treated to the blooming of one stout and true within their appropriately founded claim.
        <br>&emsp;That is our path as ones who are limited, to be insightful and allow it to seep heartily and lightly into our heart and bones. This is not the case for gods and men, merely Man. He knows this is true, for it is his limit of sight when used, that buries him deep into his own nature, wherein he senses and sees his own and common path; hereby the treats of the utmost good and grandeur are there for him if and when he signs his pact.
        <br>&emsp;Since our kind is well when we do what is rightly so, then we can say that we are sound in that alignment if the fruits of congruence are prominent. When this is the case we will know, for we will see that our nature is properly set and that the well faired happiness of being sound and round is acceptable to be deemed positive and worth our oblige. Through that offer, of our use and way, will the time and prospects of the steps ahead be revealed, in which we can see the mold and size of what it is that is our actual treat. “It is the nature of that gain then, that professes the necessary reflection onto those who have not yet seen it.” What must be remembered is that those points ahead are set within a situation beneath us. That is, if our time is bent towards a sleeping end, then so ought our actions bring us there appropriatley. In that, should our current wonderment of the living abyss ahead, be reproached upon for a humble limitedess, wherein we settle ourselves into a life which respects the fact that it will end. For in that, will our time be pleasent and easy; moreso will it be happy and abundant, as it fears little of losing something. “Death is our permanent claim, and so to our amendment for it.”
        </div>
        <div id="mindfull">
        It is clear, that when nothing is known, all will we see, for in that not, we are set and bound to the root of all things, as, like us, they are bound and made from the same. I propose that we conclude that our action and intent be set and revered on its resolve to meet this point in the greatest way, trusting that finality treats us all the same. Knowing this is true, we can marshall our nature as to be congruent to the world and her nature with respect to this. If, for example, our actions spurred reprecussions after death, then this would be a concern; seeing as they do not, our considerations need not align.
        <br>&emsp;The great question of our inquiries though, is how then should we be. Naturally, we see the world as best we can; through vision, smell, taste, sound and touch, an image is made. If one of these were gone, then we could not expect to respond as if their takes were part of the impression. That being said, I would say that beyond this figure that we design, it is reason and our intellect that marry us towards the proper thing to do. However, it must be said that in contrast to this, are more basic and primal compulsions, whereby reason is lacking. In that infant state, the impression of things is equal to those of a higher mind; the difference though is that where they are drawn to is rooted in pleasure and desires, whereas in the realm of reason, our response is more deliberate and thought out. Forewardly I'd state, that the very nature of our inquiry suggests that our stance in it suggests the need for clarity and strength in this kind of measure, that is, towards a reasonable response. Comparing this to those baser inclinations, a considered and well set thought is not required, for the essence of that way is based outside of such qualities. "It is only in the realm and use of reason that sensibility and assumptious defense is worthwhile or necessary, as these mark the nature of this way." In practice, defining and sharpening our view of the world with respect to its relevance within the use of reason allows for our actions to accordingly follow; otherwise, our mind will have nothing to sensibly grip onto -and baser impulse will be our guide instead.
        <br>&emsp;This point is what's worth addressing. Similar to one's notion of a figure born of the basic senses, the response we have to those is equal to that which we would have to reason; if a rational response is one of thought and care, then we must also be clear -as we would be to the construct of some thing, reflecting its make as seen through our eyes for example- to the workings and nature of time, mortality, order and aim. Without these as rational scaffoldings, our treatment through reason will be equal to those who see a rounded object, but assess it as being square. Note, that this does not affirm how the response should be made, but rather the quality of the impression -so that it would at least be sound. To clarify, our intention and use of the mind must see things that are based on things more than constructs; in that case, the base senses make the figure; in the case of our minds, expectations, consequences, short and long-term effects etc. are being concerned with, surpassing merely the shape and trunk of objects and things; instead, we are centering on and defining them more elaborately with respect to what they actually do. In other words, we need a means to see things with respect to how they would appear within our effective use of reason.
        <br>&emsp;That being said, we should add the proceeding point about how you determine what you should actually do. We have clarified that the composition and figure of an object, plus the workings of it and what it means over time, meld together to be a well sensed and thoughtful depiction. Considering that our assessment is strong, what should our resolve be? As a base example, you might say that something which is sweet -overly for the sake of argument- will exert pleasure and grogginess. Onto our senses, we may only see and thus respond to the former, whereas reason can see the consequences and bar you to oblige. Our question is strictly to say 'how should I treat this?' If the heart of the answer reflects the treatment of senses and desire, this we could say is irrational, whereas if the treatment was done so based on the ends and consideration born from reason and care, this could be concluded as being rational. The foremost question then of this inquiry, is whether or not we should treat things with compulsion or soundness. It seems that the nature of the former will be initially pleasing but followed by a lack of what you had before. The latter however, despite seeing less frequent spikes of pleasure and treats, may find more consistency within a broader range of situations. On top of that, I would add that this kind of being relishes itself as being so, based on the notion that such consistency is on our side; consequently are we are pleased with ourselves for being well administered and tuned; moreso, do we take confidence by virtue of the expectations which we have accounted for. Compared to those prior treats, one might say that their good is lacking; as with any thought or stout marshaling, would they appear as only bad. "Even an ape, or a fool of a mind for that matter, would at least lean towards the criteria of that. Only the latter rarely sees it until he is submitted past the point of true favor."
        </div>
        <div id="imperative">
        So what should we do? Be within the limits and stake your place beneath the king as the pawn. Simple. Know that it is a reduction though, of humility that is, rather than presuming yourself inferior to things higher than you could know. In other words, the limit of one is reflected in their ability and need to inquire; the reflection on this does not prescribe that we employ ourselves to be moved outside of this condition. Ontology suggests that something absolute will never be less, and will thus never be anything short of all things now lesser - necessitating that you will always be beneath its hind. That you are reaching then reflects the continuity of your way: and it is in that make that your nature is established, guaranteeing that there is a suitable case to be. "It is in the state of being that one's particular(of being) will have a certain fit which bears a better experience[the reel of being]."
        <br>&emsp;The distinction for man is in the remedy of whether our nature began -and if so of what kind- and whether then it will end -and then onto what we should define. It feels outside of this there would be no regard. It feels simply that because our consideration is present in this reflection, that the implications of having 'a' regard are in place: and that seems to be the condition of one beneath an absolute limit. What a nature means then gives us a palatable line, wherein the roots and seems of that are able to be strictly and thus profitably defined. Here, the effort and time for us is markedly set and placed; and its strength in being so is principally due to our resolve being the congruence of one who gives(and is showing) regard.
        </div>
        <div id="tendencies">
        This seems very simple yet applies very well. Foremost is because it grounds itself in the distinction of our base and behavioral dispositions and conveys the difference in the kind of result when each are done rightly and well. Effectively though, there is something that is lacking for us to bank the highest return. On the back side, we can be said to look for accurate measures of the world so that both foolish expectations and rightful opportunities are better explained. Moreover, would it be common and wise to reflect on our composition as it is relevant to that; therein, we could scrutinize and define the base needs we have in a more elaborate and deepened way. In doing so, we would remove the hopelessness of luxury and faulty success, as well as improve and further our knowledge and orientation around those fruitful scenarios that require our constance to achieve. Or, in other words, those things which require more consistency benefit from us knowing what it is they truly offer, so the benefit remains a target to be sought, rooting in a thorough amiability in order to bring out the claim. With this aim and means of our base nature better explained, I am unsure whether our intricate and expressive nature has been given equal care. Comparing the two sides, we would want to define what those particular aspects of us were, then elaborate on the world in which they would partake in. My feeling is that the keystone of this forefront sentiment lacks any place, and thus the body of it is given no regard at all. That is the fact that even if our personal understanding and place was well known, it would not entirely or effectively describe what we can do. For example, considering that we are industrious and that doing so is best done abundantly and prolific, then we could see how a wide and open amount of effort ought to be applied where it can; we may see then that the active nature of this concern means that activities that draw us the most will fit the measure best, those being various kinds of crafts, studies of literature and our own creation, dialogues and analysis of great works including essays, games, shows and film. Moreover, could our own training in strength and recovery be given equal attention and treatment. This seems like a sound casing for our active interest.
        <br>&emsp;The problem lies within the heart of the difference between our possessive needs, and our expressive ones. On the former, the results are mere possessions. The effort required is temporary, as the achievement of it hits the mark of success. In contrast, our active interests need consistent tending to, as if their reward were similar to the kind found in a garden. “So long as we tailor and toil as to make the effort flourish and bloom, then our interest will return to us the goods of proper treatment: it is from a successful state though.” Success is generic in our use here, but we might distinguish its application to those used in matters of acquisition and those of congeniality. For means of better fortune, success will be reached upon the arrival and gain of property, and its maintenance and continuity will be furthered by the upheaval of rights and deeds -like income to pay renewals from a lease for example [the rite to it though is cut and dry in what it requires to remain]. Our personal effort though is aimed at consistent and abundant joy. Success here, is found through the congruency of activities and interests that house the engagement of our particular nature and way. The result though differs from a physical asset in that the reward is a state of existence, whereby its heights are of a blooming state, rather than a final position. Effectively, only as long as we will ourselves towards congeniality, and abstain from being ill sought and composed, will the measure spark anything significant. Between living well and being well off, the difference is in the metric. Thus, although fortune provides rest and stability, so to does natural congruency offer tranquility and joy. “And for me, the latter feels more a like fruit, whereas the former is more like sturdier bark on the tree: one is sweet, while the other is supportive.”

        Firmly and strictly put, the most important thing for one who intends to and is thus fortuned to be able to use their time, is in how they are going to spend it. "Life is short and quickly lived; death however comes far and away: we should make sure to use the former with haste, as the latter is necessarily eventual." This sentiment has given me the notion of a figure; here, the subject is given, from inspective virtue, the most detail and care. The reason why reflects our active abilities, but our base use of them onto what we see: and onto that we ought to be sharp and accurate. What the many figurines share in common, is their need of this proper description, but equally, our congruent resolve.
        <br>&emsp;In plain terms, our view of the world marks the way in which we will engage with it. The measure for our success then will be if the efforts we placed are well founded and true -for in that the real world will be properly reflected, making our congruence to it promising and sound. From this there is a method; within this, there are two proper regards, one being the world and it's ways, as well as what we ask for, and thus what it requires to oblige. The former ought to be discerned through scrupulous assessment, so the environment is accurately known, but so too should our own intricacies and proclivities be discovered. For in their case, we'll have a personal and well fitted measure, or scale rather, in which things can be judged against. Those that fit the bill and agree with our truest selves, will earn our consent as proper objectives and treatment. "These things feel like they ought to be known."
        <br>&emsp;The question I have though is whether or not the format we develop -of insight into who we are- is rooted in a fundamental way towards the fact that we can consider at all. In other words, "is this more deliberate approach a mark that is to be reflected in the results determined?" It seems for one thing, that determination will be the case; at least, we seem to be able to and benefit the most when doing so -and this ability to do so well does suggest that it is in part a function(of us).
        <br>&emsp;Partially, the struggle is that our thinking reflects a state of unknown; thus it is hard not to believe that such an action is not the paramount thing about us. "For, if we knew everything, then we would not need to think at all. If we didnt though, then what else would be of value then reaching that point; and seeing as we are moe like the latter, does suggest the according conclusion -of valuing the thinking contained."

        The definition of virtue is the excellency of what it is you are formed to do. A clear example is the blade of a saw, and how its sharpness reflects a virtuous state in that its goal is to cut." In that sense, our consideration of how we should live might be a prominent suiter for assignment. In other words, if our aim is to provide insight into our function, and moreover then to provide the material to use it -wherein the activity is of virtue and thus harmonious- then is there any strength in supposing that our ability to inquire is a forefront to our nature? Or rather, does that core ability within us, suggest both the vessel were best to use, and thus what things are good based on their appropriate place within the use of that? Effectively, this discernment gives a mere stability and wholeness to the casing around our mold. Personally, and as it would likely be for one in any case, the things which deserve and or command our attention and effort is in some ways obvious. Through a simple inspection of who we are and what we genuinely seek, can we level the ground with clear and solid intentions. In doing so, you can produce an objective that is formed and figured with respect to your particular nature.

        <div id="kinds">
        A crow and eagle are equally birds: only the latter though is a bird of prey. Of a kind then, we are, as animals, rational. That we would be so efficably reflects our nature being prominent - wherein the roots of our kind have matured and developed. Just as an eagle who cannot catch his prey or fly very well still is a bird of prey, its integrity as one - to which we would refer to as a solid member of the kind [who displays their nature well] - is limited and ill advanced. This does not change what it is though. Tendencies, aims, desires and worry are all set to be a certain way within a certain kind. Not all kinds will have this - like a rock - but to those who do, the question is beyond the mere prescence of these things, and rather how they are in particular to the ones of a kind. "What are the right objectives of one, or poor ones? What should one of these be worried about, or look foreward to? Moreso, what should they aim for and avoid?" These are all prospects of how a thing should be. Having, for example, an objective, is too general to say that you are a kind that has one - you might be better of relating yourself to those with a nature to breath. It is of what kind of objective and interests, or needs and worries, that reflect the personal mould that fits us properly. The personal nature that calls this though , reflects the peculiar ascpects of a member within the kind: the acting of which makes them unique within their rooted assembly. The bread and butter of this is that our own congeniality is that which reflects those things particular to us: they are brought to us though throw the lense of that shared commonality: therein, we may have our own edges, but they are the details of a similar form. For example, we may all be industrious, and rational in our expression of it, but what we build will be varied and different. What decides this is a specific point to the discussion. The overall heart of the sentiment though is that whether it is short buildings or high towers, that these are mere emphasises of a shared composure and its expression.Therein, the personal production is one that reflects our own motives, tendencies and interests, but they are helmed out of the complex of which we and other members share. "We are rational animals, and onto that rationality we are born to share. That we would be rational then suggests our rooted place as the group of humanity: our own expression then, however varied, is shouldered by the casing from those who are in their core the same. And onto those actions that are personal and unique, they are bent and settled within the nature that reflects our fuller kind - wherein our own experience operates in, where we are individuals, but as ones of a kind."

        <div id="therationalanimal">
        <br>&emsp;It would not be self indulgent of me to explain why a man ought to know how to live. Moreover, would I remove the need to explain that he is one. In other words, if man is the rational animal, and rationality is the means and care to extract another’s nature, and make it relevant to oneself, then I would simply compare someone who could do this and who could not, by the mere difference that the one with reason is deliberate and actionable -while the other is less interested and able to perceive and proceed. That nature to understand then, suggests to me that the very heart of doing so reflects the root of one in such position. What does that mean though for that person, or thing rather? “If you have a mind, or more fundamentally are just able to regard, won’t it become true that this sense in some way turns in on itself? Furthermore, would your very ability to have actions and the means to choose them, justify the need for reasons which are more substantial than others? To that, I would clarify that our very nature to ask and inquire reflects our benefit and gain from doing so greatly, and onto(and thus from) which can be regarded and charitable in the foremost.” To this latter notion, could we briefly and commonly describe our quest and plea as the mere intrigue and conquest to know and understand ‘what is the meaning of life’. In other words, what is the strongest reason that holds me to do everything I do, or rather what thing will surmount all other decisions and guide us, or at least treat us to the most grounded and earthware lane? “By which all other actions can act through and towards, wherein we can then effortlessly and prosperously be.”
        <br>&emsp;How then shall we proceed? I would say that foremost, our regard and inspection settle itself into the nooks and crannies of our nature’s regard. In other words, if our nature is to ask and think, then our very essence of doing so should onto itself as one who is of the kind. Effectively, our ability to ask implies that our resolve be tuned to the answer we found. We have already detailed that the primary quest for reason entails a resolve to the truth discovered; our concern then is what that furthest response to our inquiry is, and what our path to treat and revere it ought to be.
        <br>&emsp;To the crux of our inkling, is the fact that we are limited.This is explicitly so for we know not all, and are thus less than absolute. “How could we need to question or be unsure, if we were all in total? Moreover, if we were total, would questions even be achievable at all?” To that, I say that our very ability to ask, as well as our inability to give complete answers (to fundamental things), suggests that we are limited. Put another way, our place as inquirers is truly equal and the same as those who do not know, for at most we as the inquirers sit afront the line, whereby we need to and can ask. “That domain though fairs us all a limit.”
        <br>&emsp;What is it for, I find myself asking. I am one who will die, but I am only sure of this from a valid deduction. The place and use of logic though is steeled into our uncertain minds. I cannot say this one way or the other for sure, even if my hunch and queries are based on regular happenings. The issue I believe is that for ones who know a great deal, we still have little regard for the fact that we know little at all. We generalize of course, and can attribute our kind of happenings as being similar across other relatable groups, but were encompassing, rather than being with them. Moreover, are the fundamental questions of death, finality and karma(so to speak) unknown in the strictest way. Consequently, as a game which had no known end, our resolve to be in the game and play a certain way is absolutely unfirm, and lacking anything but the utmost strength. In other words, we cannot know, or at least we do not know, and thus our resolve and steps forward are at best, rooted in what is likely -and thus a development that is strong, rather than surely true.
        <br>&emsp;The issue lies in those who can think regarding themselves as thinkers, rather than beings with thought. More specifically, I mean that we are animals with the ability to reflect and inquire. Our senses are still the same, and our bodies are still their old sort of meat, nerves and bone. These have come together though in a way in which the sounds that we once made -similar to other animals- have sharpened and straightened up, to the point where complex and subtle meanings can be expressed. Moreso, can we derive the greetings of these words and phrases, assimilating them in -as if we had our own sophisticated registry. From the ground up, it might be useful to simply consider our industry, humility, collaborations and mind, as traits and or qualities. In other words, our ability to speak well and think highly, are mere behaviors and abilities based on natural development. What this entails, is the reverence and care of one who can peer in and regulate themselves. As a being though, we are doing this; the flipside, gazing at the far front, is that imagination, resting and caring for things other than its house: it has become the manor. “And that is the paramount distinction.”
        <br>&emsp;If the mind which treats itself cannot reach full fruition, then are we to believe that this is the soundness way? In contrast, if the rational animal could fully be and live unto their purest way, would that not mark the place to be? This rests on the assumption that the right way to be and envelop is the one with the proper gain. In other words, some things might be objectively better than others, but if you are set for something other, then measuring yourself to be congruent and greeted by that has more warrant as the way. It is sure to think that love from men, or thought from their minded being, has more abundance and cheer than the simple harmony from the swimmings of a fish, or flight of a bird. The question then, is it better for the bird to reach higher living through more intricate and rich facilities, or is it better of doing what it is better set and born to do -whereby its heights are met by the winds of the sky, rather than the soaring gullies within our mind. At heart, this sentiment describes the nature one has as being the truest aim and reward from being demonstrated. And there is strength to this, and whether most applicable or not, it at least is solid to stand near the front of our regard as a model which is worth admitting. The question though, is how do we know. If we cannot and do not, how is there anything we can properly say that has any bearing? “When you play soccer, your position is moved and set by the confines of the rules and of the game; keep the ball within the lines, push up and play for the aim of scoring. In life though, how could you tell whether you should play soccer or not -despite knowing its own rules. For what does the game of life require?”
        <br>&emsp;My concern here, is on the two likely suppositions. We are the mind and reaching ever on through it, so that we know the most and develop it further; or, we are men who have the abilities of the mind, but merely turn inwards and use it as a better means of harnessing and materializing our truer selves. “The remark made by Epictetus has some fair here. He says simply that talent, for example, is well known by its suiter. The example of a Bull is given, where it knows it can and must stand and fend off incoming lions and threats; a small child on the other hand may know that they have a knack for and wish to proceed through some common craft.” What I suspect, is that our intention and adherence to the minds developed offerings is mistaken for the way in which we proceed -as opposed to resolving to treat and place ourselves in the things we discovered. In other words, our ability to think has given us the impression that our place and time is set and pillared on the advancement of thinking. Similar to the talents of someone, those skills are onto a thing, of which they are personally not: it is something they have.
        <br>&emsp;The reason I struggle here, is that if we accept our place as one who thoughtfully proceeds, then I see and am barred by a host of presumptions and assumptions -foremost as to why we are doing this at all( the unknown hyperbole). Not only can I reduce things through a well rested nature of my own, as to see clearly what my place and kind is, it merely serves me better to address myself as the thing which bears both the qualities of reason, but the thing served by them upon their gain. From that, it is much easier to acquire true and abundant meaning. Forwardly, it is the interest I have and orderliness of the instrument of extraction, that reflects the fact that this is what is meritable in its importance to me. In other words, my very interest to ask, along with my excitement and care to make use of the answer, suggests what reason is used for in me, and thus what I should do. “For I am then a thing, a being, an animal, who is acting confidently and just, onto and from reason, of which my make and gain is truly and soundly made.” That is the rational animal.

        <div id="judgement">
            To do with our assessments and there relevance to us, the most prominent distinction, when it comes to us, is the fact that we are conscious. If we were not, what judgments could be made? It seems as though, if right and wrong(or value in general) is attempted to be defined, the very nature of you being able to ask and inquire, somehow impacts the scale for those things and their measure.
            <br>&emsp;In contrast, things without the ability to think, naturally go their way, drifting like seaweed over the ocean tide; we are not this way. We are rooted with similar intent, though, our faculties have some grip for us to steer, being deliberate as we please. "To see things for what they really are, including us and our way, draws on us to be accurate and kept, so we may peer with precision. Without this, we are similarly floating, for our sense bore no stay."
            <br>&emsp;There is an orderliness to the common life, for it knows not that it will die, or end. As light becomes clear, and sound and noise become pronounce, the orphace that holds impressions becomes aware of itself, that 'we' are hearing and seeing; focused attempts can thus be made. My feeling though is that as much as we are aware, by our simple senses, to which animals share, the concentration that covers the basics sees that the end is coming, and that if we do not direct ourselves with clarity and intent, it will unknowingly pass away. This is why we care, and wriggle when doing nothing; we know were wasting our time, that we are withering away. "Only in life, in living, do we forget that this will end. In our rest though, we are wise and tenable, to reflect and appreciate that this is both our way and blessing, having lived and seeing that, although temporary, we are free and plentiful in our ability to support and relish the experience of being." When we ignore that, our idleness springs an alert, for we feel like nothing; as if we are unable to live. It is best to die and be dead than be alive but feel little so. This is why our conscious forbitity is worth regarding; it tells us that reason guides the way; only, that which passes the test has done so with those respects, for living had our aim. Vice and insolence are rooted in that common living - being passive seems thus the wrong way to go, by its corollaries, of poor action. Being aware draws us to treat ourselves with care, for we know there is a limit in our way. Without strength and aim within our attention, no gain is made, for congruence is lacking. "There is no mold to furnish our gains." Let us value the ability to do so and be mature enough to see that being conscious is the real claim; as it guides us to live, and holds our worthwhile claims. Like a soldier and his sword, we are inseparable. The battle is won by those who try, for in victory and defeat they remain in their condition, and thus keep at rest, tranquil and blessed, in living and death.

         <div id="deliberation">
            Perhaps, simply, the very question bars an answer. If you are asking a question, and your faculty to do so brings further inspection onto 'the one who is addressing', then you might say that the uncertainty of what 'you' should do, is clarified by addressing the nature of the very one which is inquiring. If I were a rock, I would just be, without apprehension or activity. As a man though, I have direction; my ability to be as such engaged, comes either because(or alongside) of our very ability to ask, or at least make an impression. That intake, of the world, surely draws us to be a certain way. By the means of discernment, that faculty (in response) desires harmony and thus asks the whereabouts of these impressions - as that would seemingly give guidance to our way. What are senses do is simply let us know what the world is and how it responds to us, that it takes cold and brings warmth, bears hunger but also yields satiety. "By my nature to ask, in many ways suggests what the answer should be, can be, and whether or not it would be favorable or not: for will I not ask further questions? And if so, ought the profit of those results be in line as to support that?"
            <br>&emsp;This planet of mine is born through geology, rooted in the dust clouds dispersed amongst the remnants of previously formed stars. From the chaos that geographically ensued, life and its preceding constituents emerged, forming further complexities defined by a response to the environment. It is said and consistently shown, that all things(in this case) are what they are through developments inherited and that those traits (themselves) promulgate due to the stresses placed on them by the environment. Our own species comes from Mammalia, which, compared to reptiles and birds, naturally has more intelligence. An Elephant picks things up with its trunk, Dolphins jump for joy as they spritz through the water, as do mice have a sophisticated taste for cheese. We are different though. As a result of our industry and construction onto the world, our faculties have concentrated. Sticks have a nature, as do rocks, and experimentally - when rubbed together - yield both spark and flame. The very development of this brings our primary concerns into simpler congruence, as our hunger and thirst(fundamentally) can be easier met. As in the stability and state of those amongst the islands and shores across the Aegen and it's seas, the lineage of humanity has come from comparable simplicities - with further insights and development being the subsequent consequence and reward. Beyond what is known, it is clear that our faculties and capacities have substantially changed; what they are employed for though, in many ways this remains.
            <br>&emsp;My overall inquiry is not to clarify the needs that need mending. Instead, I am looking to see the way things are so that I may demonstrate and apply myself toward what seems the right way to prosper and be. The greatest things fit a mold of good fortune and joy; in which spot they are placed is based on their essence and our judgment. The question at the end of the day roots itself, deeply, towards the concern and regard for the basis of that judgment. Judgment it would seem brings us to decide what and how we should do something and, thus, in general live. Things are as they are, becoming new through transition but remaining equal as members of the roster of things; as such, all have an essence and invites us to evaluate. Our interest in benefit will see that we do so with precision. Since we are the ones inquiring, and that we are aware that this is our rooted address, will see that our curiosities and inspections are given proper treatment and regard. In doing so, will our rational attempts be more full and rounded, and consequently more promising and fertile "So that our natures may be expressed well, and be then rewarded in a congenial way. In that, we've truly gained."

         <div id="assessment">
            Consciousness is best described by the stream of your moment, stacking concurrently from past to present. Our thoughts though, on the manner, reflect an imprecise measure of how this comes and 'streams' to be. One of the issues I suggest is that we have little regard for what absolute thought is, especially, when it comes to the sprout of our thinking. Most definitely then, should the ultimate thing be revered and assessed through the strongest approach. "Or in other words, if our aims are high, yet we are small, then we ought to be sound and well-founded in our attempt to proceed." Since this means something thorough, we must first come to grips with and define the constituents rooted in the assessment. The rule, in summary, goes as follows. Propositions are queries for success; they are made by those and only to whom would make use of them, making them rooted (in essence) to a means of reflection; moreso and to the point, that which you propose is a prompt for direction, that a certain choice or action would be taken for reasons that merit the claim being proposed. If we adhere to this invitation, then we have decided(as much as we are true to inquiry) that the premises are both sound in their use and valid in granting the proposal. I would describe our minds proceedings then, that it is not one, or 'a', rather so, being a state which proceeds, like a stream that merrily goes. 'That' current then is what we are regarding. With respect to the humanities, we would say that this clarity of what and how we are, as thinkers, works for our interest in making actual claims. The insight into the flow of and fruit of this inquiry merely boldens and satisfies the proper use and resolve of reason, where good choices can be truly made.
            <br>&emsp;With your permission, I will elaborate on the constituent parts. The gem of this is our value. Here, parameters are employed as a scale for things to be properly measured, then judged. We're looking for things that make us happy; regarding food, for example, this means something nourishing and fresh. What merits the claim of whatever houses these aims, is in things like robustness and strength, which earn their place as elements of our judgment, as our evaluation is bent toward us achieving those things. "Consequently, we can define our judgment through the criteria which gives the scale for approval." The care for how we wish to be, generally, molds the requirement for your advance. Things are inspected when it comes to that resolve, becoming what they are in how they relate to us and our aim. A pen is a writing tool; its composition is not relevant for the pure sake of scripture and thus bears no concern outside of its parts that are of interest to us.
            <br>&emsp;One of the struggles I personally face is that besides pure definition, the outputs of the function(so to speak) are helmed foremost to everyday decisions that I try and make. I am not a creator who is addressing the proper way for things to stabily proceed; I am a thing reflecting on the bones of that creation, concerned with my own decision so that my rooted interests are met; I am motivated by reason to be so congruent so that our own happiness and freedoms are met. "My values then are best defined in terms of what actions would be concluded as effective. Moreso, am I obliged to define this personally, and in the simplest of ways." I don't see anything traditional or divine in entirety; mine, along with many others, observe a nature to things and trust that they persist normally, remaining consistent with what we see. My place amongst those things is simply one who can impress, treated by the very things that float around me. Things which are further or of a grander sort - of an abstract kind too - are merely elements beyond my register; they are important, and almost necessarily elements which are prepped for our minds, but we are not them nor are they us. We are derived from them at best, but our impressions and resolve should be centered on us. Not them. "We are a fish in a sholl, bent by the ocean, home in the sea; I care not for Poseidon though, for I think not that he holds shrimp in far-off bays depending on my devotion; rather, he's set it aside for me already, and every other thing to. In that, I am simply concerned with air in my gills, and plankton to chew on." The point being that these are things which I desire and am thus ordained towards. My value thus follows, rather than being misarranged towards the one who gives. "My judgment is based on that which I've already received. Hence the graciousness."
            <br>&emsp;It is clear quite simply, that we are products of our environment. That our industry and directedness have become so prominent suggests efficiency within the system. What I would regard most highly though is that this structure remains. As a basic nothing wherein things proceed or the very mixture in which we are all held, there is a community of objects working amidst one another, networked and co-developing. The nature of consciousness then is a measure for this flowing state, noticing and amending to each and every changing moment, be it fully subsequent or proceeding. Our own regard for this comes from nature, as we are aware of her in ourselves - in that we are things that realize their own role in the game. Perhaps, in summary, of our attempt to conclude, we can say that our definite description is not single in its substance, and thus hard to know. "I feel though, the right to remain individual, resting on our judgment being as good as 'we' can get it." It is true that a better understanding can be reached, yet I suspect that it is our attempt to contain the 'whole' within an explicit description, that bars us from being more thoughtful and progressive. Put another way, our wish to make absolute claims keep us from making stronger ones, as our place within the former has our views being small amidst that ultimate reality; to me, there is more fare in a larger view, but of strength, or suggestion rather. We are small by nature, and thus our hope for the greatest of claims will see our attempts being futile and small. Illustrating the whole of things seems a better approach, as we can merely stand by a suitable depiction, rather than needing every minute detail in the portrait. "It earns us little to have such a tiny frame, even if every element inside is microscopically detailed. I prefer a soft and tidy picture of something large. For in that, I can see the whole."
            <br>&emsp;When we can see entirety in a way that is appropriate to us, we can advance our view of how it seems; our regard is meant for proper hunches though. Insight into what else is present only clarifies. We will personally be unable to grip and entertain the whole of reality in the strictest way; but let's not be small in our wish to hold something of the latter. Simply, we can address the fact that there is one, assessing what that means; our resolve then has considered the greatest thing imaginable, the idea at least. We were not made for the universe's registry, only the recognition of items and their place amongst the list. I do feel that a conscious definition can be claimed. I know however that my position is ultimately limited, even when I know all the entries. What I admit, is that despite being able to assess and remember every item in the store, I can regularly and reliably assess both the summary and incomes of the goods brought in and sold from the property. From that, a more suitable assessment can be made, and thus a more congenial scale for our judgment can be employed. "That is all anyone needs."

         <div id="gods">
            God is not necessary in precedent, rather it is a sound belief to attribute the name 'God', being oneness and throughout, as the idea that seems greatest to you. What is greatest must be God, by the attributes of what divinity seems, of presence and power throughout all of any entirety; whatever it is that seems to be that thing all-encompassing, assigned to that we will the label of God. Let us assume that there is a God, common and sound as one would know, or think to be - of monotheistic and traditional qualities. If we continuously stripped the essence of what amounted to God, where would we stop if we presumed to know what would at least still render this being divine? Perhaps its omnipotence, in power, or presence and state throughout. My bias suggests that it is knowledge, awareness at least of all that is. The greatest thing would amount to more than everything less than itself; only so much as you are greater can you be something absolute. Partially then, if something was only somewhat familiar with all things, then I would venture that they are no holy god, only partially.
            <br>&emsp;The furthest reach of entirety requires no control to be present. As a ball rolls down a hill, God need not pull it; his work has rendered the plains of existence to correspond in necessity so the ball, from the act of it being let(down), will do so by the presence of God's initial creation. "In that, he has already done enough." My point is that God is not one who exerts but is the entirety of all things and all things in their entirety. Their functions are natural as you would expect and their correspondence requires not admission from God and his will, rather that he be aware that they are following. "It is by his graces that you are able, having already paved the way." My thinking is that if he did not know whether you would fly or tumble outside of his interference suggests he is not aware of things as they are in themselves. "For how would the game maker not know the pawn's every move?" The assumption is that modality, as in the travels of things throughout existence, have their possibilities dictated by the interactions that spur them, rather than someone who nudges. Instead, the take of your make is done by the direction calling on the necessary path. God has made what is necessary so, not though that you would go.

         <div id="mortality">
            The foremost thought, or regard rather, is of our mortality. In being so paramount, so to its description, which demands the highest avoidance of presumption and thinness. First, we must ask what it means, in death. Compared to life, where we are subject to horror and joy, nothingness bars any sort of impression. If that were merely it, then our knowledge of this would be based on confirming this as our theology and resolving ourselves through suitable ethics.
            <br>&emsp;One of the things which digs into our side here are assumptions. Generally, we wish there to be something from death. I feel this is because we are unclear as to what it would be otherwise, moreso, do we think and confound a notion of hell, besides this murky notion of time in death’s existence. The clarity I would propose rests simply on the notion of reverence for what is enough. “I will grant you the agreement of making for what is best, foolhardy or not. My question though, is that with a little ethical care and the removal of Paradisal ambition, would tranquil and neutral existence not be permissible, accepting at least?” If we think about the nature of nothing, we can at least agree conscionably to the nature in this proposition, that it is normal and amiable. An issue that is rooted here, in contrast, is the proliferation of ‘nothings’ reputation. We hear someone say there is no god or afterlife, and the response is ‘you beast, who hurt you’. My question is with respect to the heart of this inquiry. If our concern is of the utmost importance, then should we not treat it whole and full, roundly and with care? If so, will we not treat it with purity and strength, removing assumption and inaccuracy? Truly then, what is the definition we place on death in a natural way? This is not to disregard and collude away from more ‘traditional’ sentiments, but rather a illustrate a clear description. “We seem so sure about the norm, and nor are we opposed to seeking alternates; have these latter though been given any proper depictions? How then will we amend.”
            <br>&emsp;To give that side some bones and credit, hear the following. When we die there is nothing; that is what death is. In this state there is no sight or conception, for we are not and thus separate to what remains. None can follow or provide; nothing can scare you or bring you delight; there is no hope for nothing will change, nor is there fear ‘for no loss can be gained’. This is your end as it is mine: and the natural side of things bends us down this lane. In seeing this as true, we have materialized our greatest integrity; in doing so, the conclusion drawn is forewardly made for use in your stature;
            <br>&emsp;The closing is as follows. Because we can ask, we can make use of the results; thus we can treat and respond. If the knowledge of our death is that it is peaceful and free, then we can be sure of the good we are only guaranteed. What will that person do then, who knows their end: I simply say you be blessed, in your joy and cherishment of the way ahead. Be happy that the road is clear, for it ends cleanly and with ease. “This path is the one most followed, for it is reached by us and those the same.” Your thoughts can build and aspire to see and meet great things; find it in your mind though and know that it is true: temporarily will there only be you. In reaching such an end, let there be positivity on approach. Consequently, may you be so full and without grievance to leave, that the rest ahead brings no fear of the dead. Such good will bring you to jump right in, happily and satisfied with your life which reached this just end; you are done and ready to go, where living is no longer your state, merely rest. “Having the former is what makes the latter pleasing and acceptable.” One’s integrity to that marks a resolve to the natural way, giving our side of choice one other.

            Because we are actionable, our regard for so, generally, draws us to ask - consider at least - the effect of those actions. Its understandable, simply, seeing as we evolved out of a primitive state, which was, to say, more dangergous and frugal, demanding thus, that we take more care and pay attention in what we do. Theology is this concern abreviated by the awareness one has of themsevles and the limit placed upon us. We know this introspectively, in some regard -moreso as we evolved, civally - but most notably, to do with our attention, is the passing of others, directly or as a tale passed on; in short, we know whats coming. Being somewhat able, though primitive, we asked the question about our deaths and there place: What would it be like? where do we go and, most importantly, are there reprecussion of what will happen that stem from our actions here, in life. This is Theology, our regard for judgement on our end and its relation to our state as beings ; we are looking for Benevolence because we are able to consider that some is possible at all ; "Its the idea of missing out, or being forever punished, that makes us frantic in our current state. Note, almost determinaly, that these concerns rest on those who, as if being able to see for the first time, are drawn to misery and fear over the notion of some possible sight; If they actually looked more carefully, they would realize that there was nothing short of the burning sun, the moon and its glowing way." It is our ignorance of what death actually means that bairs us down a strict path of greedy salvation, for we have given no moral concern. Equally then, we experience ignorant suffering, missing the unassuming life, that, riled with joy and flourishing, is scaffolded, strongly and just, with the understanding that our end is natural, to our ease in being blessed, tranquil in our memory, for we have seen the way. Nature has laid this road, we must bend our stake. Marrying her post so we can see her gain, happy and savouring, we know theres peace through the end, boistrous while were waiting

            When we were boys, we knew the world by what we could see. There was no war or depravity, merely play, pleasure and fun. As we grew older though, duty was placed in front of us and we were asked to amend. When we didn't, there was conflict and trouble; when we did, however, we lost our way to what it was for. Life you see is short and seldom. Once we have this chance to appreciate and ascend to the world and her offer. "Our brief chance to be treated by the green in her way."
            <br>&emsp;How this contrasts with organized religion, is simply in what it is for. By our very nature, we are congenial to inquire. Without the results of previous investigation, the steps forward are stemmed from ignorance. This is the cause of religious proliferation. Because we have reached a point in which all we can see is thoroughly known, the supernatural bears no claim or fielty. The problem here is at the forefront. Tradition has developed from an adolescent stage, rooting herself in to become the norm. The prominence of this, by my diagnosis, has monopolized the ability to be devout in alternatively congregate ways.
            <br>&emsp;All of those who are in said way, happen upon it because of religion's lineage. Going back to a millennia, it is those who attempted to be congruent who hold this way, in being devoted, with disregard for nature and how she really is. The problem is clear, that this worship is based on a lack of reason, merited only in that it was what those(at the time) could come together about. It is because we form together on what is paramount, despite lacking any sufficient tools to do so, that's lead to any explanation being sound. Moreover, has this nature of ours to team up on what is important wounded the ability for current teams to be made. "The entire league is full of religion; but this was based on folly."
            <br>&emsp;Seeing as we are social creatures, my feeling is that our rational aspects should bear the grouping and helm of our time. If we are together, let it be for something that is truly good; this is how friendship through interest forms. We gather together based on similar values and attitudes of both bad and good: this is the root of congregation. My own resolve is to bare a credible and enriched claim, by the fruits of reason and her gain. By the natural principle, all exists in a shared way; if we task ourselves with bearings to this, then similar joys and kindness can be made, but from a sensible angle. "And seeing how our past has given us much salvation but wretched worldly affairs, I suspect that if we were otherwise wholly rational, then fully could we succeed at both."
            <div class="qu">Let there be goodness from reason so that all of our concerns will either be removed or dealt with. It is ill-founded not to have both</div>
            Quickly, I would like to give our goal some attention. I am a man, and this means a craft. We ardor away, with efficiency, so that we may groove and last. "This is our inherited way." Since civil dawn, we have been building and crafting, imparting ourselves for tribute and utility. As someone who is drowning throws their arms to issue a defense with all their strength and time, we, similarly, have built things that reflect a similar interest. Or rather we have made similar responses based on our own needs. Food, being essential, encourages us to be more able in how we gather and produce; furthermore, our communal setup suggests we find better ways to share and distribute; the success of that makes our proficiency opportune. The process of these advancements resulted in a stricter yet richer path, in which our nature was bent towards an industrious way. "The tools we've slated, the roof over our heads, these breakthroughs see our nature easily amended, for the result has been a simpler ask for us to groove into our environment. Consequently, this ingrained craftsmanship has seen our position become more positive, like a chair to sit in is quick to find comfort."
            <br>&emsp;This line seems to go back to our earliest days. To rubbing sticks together, to the creation of the wheel, since Erectus to Sapian, the world has continued to expand. I have some trouble though. For one thing, it is clear that cultural and mannered norms also develop as we establish ourselves throughout the environment. Similar to the base adage of 'specialization earned through agriculture', governance and society also develop, as if a crust to hold this new abundance. I cannot reconcile though the development and solidity of civilization, with the response through religion to ill-sifted impressions. Probably then, the question is about trying to define the link between industry and the furthered clarity of the world and what we see. It seems fair to suggest that complex things were at one point not exposed. Primitive life surely had no lens that even knew something so large and complex was occurring; yet at some point, we were able to see the magnanimity throughout our environment. Religion then seems to be the convention of our attempt to properly respond. The argument and explantion goes very simply. The initial attempts to satisfy what we regarded as 'God', were rooted(seemingly) in the infancy of our impression and ability to explain. As things became bigger, the more we were asked to make sense of the world, in this bolder sense. What is said by me, and most of those considered intelligent, is that this primitive stage bore the religious response.
            <br>&emsp;Through millions of years of evolution, we could finally and fully see. The fruit of that insight was not materialized with any accuracy though, and as if being able to see for the first time, our judgment was made outside of the rooted measure of things seen before. I would define our earliest religious attempts then, as one who earned a tool but, understandably, lacked the disposition from its use, to then see where it would proceed. "It is as if the phenomena came first and overwhelmed any ability to discern and measure." Looking back, it seems silly and easy for us living in the modern day, for all that is here is clear and known. Back then however, there would be nothing previously inquired. It would seem like a nightmare, which dwelled on one's mind and had little means to solve and remove. No wonder an answer was sought. I understand, like I said, the reason and motivation for things proceeding as they did, as it is clear(as they say), 'that a poor theory is more favorable than not having one'. I do not commend it though or invite a continuation.
            <br>&emsp;If our senses tell us that these beliefs and proclamations are folly, then we should not belittle them and have them thrown out. "For that is effectively what religions do to each other, and our own truths require no such course of action." Similar to those who have committed crimes, the following steps and action should be taken if some resolution is to be made. First off, and quickly till its met, is the removal of those who make others at risk for harm; when this is no longer a condition, then they shall proceed and join those in the second group, who are administered with the aim of rehabilitation. These people are equal to us, they just need to be trained. "Their goal is no different than those who are without infraction, they've merely slipped." Considering the suggestive nature of their predicament, relevant care should be and remain present; to what we all need though, they should be given, or at least moved, towards a position where they can make a viable and stable use of that.
            <br>&emsp;All of that being said, those in a religious position are not to be condemned nor left alone as is. They should be encouraged and shown, as we were as secularists. The more truth that we have gained, reveals the weeds of those whose claims are based on an ignorant tradition. The way to proceed is not by tyranny and despotic governance - for those would be similar in how they rule, only different in that their law stemmed from being secular. No, the means and answer to our problems and path is through a similar formation, like those religious, to what we find similarly important. Whereas those in the past gathered and indited based on the fear of that which imposed, our side of sensibility knows that truth found from reason, sets us all free indifferently. "This is why there are no pograms or crusades on the subject of Newtonian physics." From this, there is no reason to be afraid, and, thus, no purpose in persecuting or demanding obedience. "We who are with nature are already made; so we seek not, to either gain or deliver, rather our truth sets us evenly within ourselves." Seeing as this is ours, it is clearly one and for all. The gifts of science and philosophy are the tools for these extractions: they are in wide abundance though and require no tyranny to prevail, share or command. "The goods of art and industry are based on our generosity; moreso are the results self evident - and organized accordingly." We need only show then, rather than be given to or within a stance of delivery. Our truths are found by simply be people, and all that it means. Foremost then will our personal and corresponding congregational resolve, be based as if it were of religion or theology: it is merely full and round.

         <div id="extremes">
            At the height of organized society, Jesus Christ presented an insight into Man's core problem. Essentially, his concern was that material possession and a life devoid of God - the Christian at least- was prime for disarray and, at least, a thorn in our present scenario. This seems acceptable; the world had been progressing for many thousands of years and the interest and power of those in this material charge, were not directed at or aimed towards the appealment of the Gods, or at least avoided the scrutiny if it did it 'improperly'. Furthermore, it is regarded that 'Original Sin' foretold a return to a harmonious state with the lord, to which Jesus is credited as being the arrival - hence his death for our sins. The claim of this does have some merit in that it speaks to our arrogant way. Man is industrious, and can bend the environment with tools and construction to treat his own nature and claim. Doing so is not wrong, however, once this stability is set a problem becomes poignant: what is it for? It would seem that survival takes all precedence and that our ancestry is rooted in the continuation and success of that. It never had or was ever intended how things should be when that concern was no longer present. Generally, as it stands, either indulgence(by virtue of our free time) or respect for what comes far later(when our days on earth are no longer as free) is given the regard.
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps the extremes of both sides can give insight into the problem. On one hand, Utopian views of the world are present by the fantasy of even more proficiency. Considering our civilized success, inefficiencys and inequality show that the gains are not for all and, thus, better arrangements ought to be made. In that tyrannical regimes respond, who, based on this absolute ideal and notion, order themselves and command as to bring out this way. The issue here, that religion does address, is that however fortunate and well off we are, everyone still dies. The roots of what that mean may be traditional and primitive, but they do have a point. If we are to live, what is it for? It seems contrary that this should mean we forgo all the fruits of our living world, attesting to the unknown which follows. The point worth noting however, is that no matter the freedom within this current life, all of it gets flattened out by that coming end. "Where everyone has equal amounts of nothing." If this is true, or sound at least, the resolve towards it is in no way revealed by the heart of the matter. Only, it humbles us and keeps us centered and astute. "Being drunk and foolish fairs little as you reach death's door. And the point is that the former is not given outside the path to the latter." Although the details must be further understood, we could say that the point of Jesus, or the point towards sin in general, is that it does not bring one to that certain end, with any dignity lets say.
            <br>&emsp;With regard to religion though, their absolute claim is based on the agreement and dedication of effort and intentions when it comes to God. This comes from a branch of truth, but, it is addressed and ill-comprehended in a way that its merits can make. Religion bases itself on the misapprehension of the creator's claim. We see it as the cause of things in our environment, but further that to be the holder of an existence after death. Our mortality being our sophisticated stake, sees the primitive roots of it develop alongside the earlier notions of a higher power, who, seeing as he is and does all, has a similar grip on death and its gain. This is why there is a trunk of discontent and disregard for our time as living. The complex nature of religion has become a total regard for the thing which bars importance: our death. Since, in their view, this condition is only met by treating the lord properly and well, the very essence and care for our time as living things bear no interest or claim. "As they say, it is not what being is for." On that note we can better understand the theological claim of sin, which is clear in what addresses it and which runs contrary to it. If our view of that end is different than those of the traditional kind, we can at least attest to their being one at all. "Even if we see it as simply natural." In that case, being gluttonous and vain supports no path toward its finish. Which one though is true and what elements are appropriate as a response, this is not wholly clear. The point, is that although our sins may be accurately reflected in our reckless ways, there is no contrasting approach or ideal which has given alternative truth. "For in that case, the good was similarly ill-founded."
            <br>&emsp;Contrasting the two, Material Utopias have absolute aims in the groundwork of governance and technology; religion, instead, bears admission of a higher power and its hold on eternity: that is its absolute claim. The truth in suggesting that there is Original Sin has strength in the disregard for the meaning in our lives. Without respect to our mortality, we will not live well; our innate fear only encourages further stability, of which none can prevail. "The cliff runs over for dirt and Queens." This fear however, is ignored and irrelevant to our animal ways, from the accumulation of our success in the environment. Even though we have done so substantially, our life still has very little claim. It is this more innate acceptance that religion centers on. The religious feeling is prior to the organization of those motivated by remission from their deaths. Initially, it was just an overwhelming response. The development though, of what we concluded there to be, became the spot where our deepest issue could be placed: our deaths. In that, we were honest. We admitted - however erroneously - to our real fear. By addressing that, we were at least trying to live the best of our lives. The issue with religion, as it developed, is in similar ways to the flattening of Utopias. In each case, the aim is based on the perfection of means; religion's err, in that case, stems from the precedent of life after death, besides our actually being as the claim; equally, communism and fascism seek similar precedents in their way, differing though in that it is for our being in life. It fails in the same way though, as it ignores and colludes our actual joy and stake.
            <br>&emsp;These admissions of survival and death are equal in what they require. Their acceptance and regard is paramount if we are to prevail and taste the treat of life's joys and her offer. That is our stake, in living. It is only so that it would be our claim, for it was sought and made deliberately so. It is in that decisive decision that reveals the fork in the road: As creatures who can administer being as the aim, consideration and strength in their assessment and address- through the mind that can - paves the way for our claim to take. It is only in being ourselves that we can truly be, for, equally, it'd mean a sound expression. It is from that toil though, that we should make for, as it is what marbles the way. Through reason and inquiry, we demonstrate ourselves as one who can confess and address that living well is the way to be. Using those tools however is the proper way, in that, we must respect our living and death so that we can flourish and be. "Ought we do this properly as to avoid those extremes?"

            As I know more I will begin, that relgion is primarily a fellowship of interest, devout and in unison towards the praise and wares of God. There is not truth in anything thats said, but, most notably, it is clear and evident that this very tendency to congregate - and in turn share how were are devout - suggests the nature of fully aware humans; moreso as we go, it seems obvious that the very development of our ability to more fully impress, correlates with an arrangment towards that ' whollyness', as if it were divine. It is as if we are more aware that the floods have occured and damaged our livelihood; it seems to me that our spiritual devotion comes from the very concern of what is most important; what is worth noting though, is that it is exactly the means in which we realize things to be important, that cause use to bear our stake to that which seemingly proports it: It is faully then, considering how little, in those early moments at least, that we'd understand. Since Science and rational 'Maturity'(as I'll call it) has taken place, our clarity of why these things that matter occur. The difference though, is that despite the irrational goal of appeasing a concieved propagotor, of such calamites, we, in the present, still have not developed our own personal goal. Whereas those in relgion mobilized to pray and offer themselves for the sake of the plague and its remission, we humans now, however developed, merely have an understanding that these occurences are pure and natural- despite the misfortune - : We only know this through sound tools of measurment; we still care little, and act as such, as to how and why we conduct our lives.
            <br>&emsp;On to Divnity then: This is best described as the actions of what is supernatural. Ignoring pantheistic inadeqacy- of our explanation - things that occur outside of the natural order, are defined as being 'Supernatural'. Attributed by us, these actions are induced by a being, referred to as a deity, or a God; monotheistically, meaning, in your regard at least, their is only one defining spirit, will see you refer to that essence strictly as God; contrasting here with one, as in 'a', of many, sees the difference. By definition, it seems the very presence of the divine, suggests that the natural world is not fundemental, or at least primary and isolated, for the spirit - so to speak - in both way permeates and transcends the material world, existing throughout and above. In more common terms though, we can consider that, despite existing outside of this normal realm, there is still a 'nature' - so to speak - of this deity or God. In other words, what we described as a deity, the Divine, or God, is the qualities and attributes that we see as being supernatural: Those being, notablly, omnipotent power, full presence and awareness, total knowledge and subsequene, to name a key few. Where the consideration of this hits a fork, is simply the fact that, at least when it comes to formal regard, our reasoning for what a God is, differs from what religion infers. Whereas we, as intellectuals, see God, by definiition, as being prone to and in command of these aspects - that make the entity god like- , religion sees aspects(notably) of desing, benevolence and Grace. There impression is not from a sound and thorough source, as if they considered what a God would have in order to be, then saw those qualities through some impression. Instead, their 'fuzziness' in prayer and respect, bends together with the hope and promise that supernatural powers our present when it comes to us. In that case, it is not complete power that we - the religion - regard, but rather that all powerful beings interest and charity to us. It is clear, moreso, to the description of this, that our fear and expectations, is that our actions motivate such deity to respond in a certain way; it seems then that misfortune came before reason was produced; thus, attribution and custom were developed, as we tried to understand the casue of calamity, and, in such, treated it as though it were a punishment: Proper dealings with and praise became cultured norms, as to avoid future suffering.

         <div id="houseofcards">
            Theologically, the concept of divine intervention is tricky. Foremost is that each member of the whole seems to bounce off and reflect their positions relative to the others; introducing new ones then seems incompatible as the entire system would have to account for it: this is based on the premise that the system on any given day, already accounts for entirety and its constituents. I cannot vouch for whether this premise is sound though -it is merely placed as a point of clarity and position.
            <br>&emsp;I think a local example would do us more service. Disregarding the factual attempt or even the historical account, I question whether the holes in Jesus’ hands upon resurrection were repaired or left the same. In addition, I offer the point that he is still a man regardless of his inhabitance by God, and therefor ought to be supposed to respirate, among the other accompanying physiological systems. The question I would raise on this account is with respect to the reinstatement of oxygen into the lungs and depletion of carbon dioxide -by virtue of the fact that they were either both absent, or that the lungs were flat in general, and by the dynamics of gas pressure, could not suddenly again take in 02. “Less these elements were unnaturally introduced, how could the process proceed?” Perhaps the argument is that there was no following need to breathe. But my feeling then is that resurrection on this basis is incompatible with any physiological concern.
            <br>&emsp;Now, I understand that he is the son of God, and the natural rules that everything else obeys is not so relevant, especially considering the adjustments made by the holy hand. But if such an embodiment was done onto an orange, we would still say this is citrus; and if the spirit landed in honey, it would be strange if we found it unsweet. “For what would it even be then, despite the host?” And the point, is that be it of a plain man or one housed by God himself, are the workings of man -or at least his parts common to the rest- not likely and at any rate guaranteed to be present? Again, who is the son of God being when he housed within a body, which we’d compare to man, but lacks any need to breathe? More than that, how does he have a metabolism and thus any means to use his muscles, or have a heart beat? “I am surprised he could even stand.” Perhaps, the missing pieces, or their intended products, were merely introduced. The crux of our concern though, is if something can only be due to intervention, or unnatural and non-concurrent means that is, then the contrariety of this must be accounted for amidst all other ordinary acting things; or, more importantly, if the actions of everything around did not show any signs of responding as though their course was deemed contrary -via that moment of intervention- then we may rightly suspect that such a disruption did not occur. 
            <br>&emsp;At this point, we are not making the claim that nature was or was not suspended, merely resting on the fact that if it was, that all other things around would show signs that it had. And as it were, things appear to be going as if nothing abruptly happened. To be clear, the notion of ‘the first cause’ is not what we’re referring to, for even that may have been God’s generous command. Only, in that case it would be initial, whereas of all things that have so far come, none appear to be shifted around by any event besides that. “Which is to say, nothing so far has in between, intervened.” And such a fact, however concurrent with the records of nature, runs with much contrariety to that of man.
            <div class="qu">As they say though, struggle is God’s way of challenging us in order to make us stronger:  the acceptance of truth which, and honest admission to it, is the hallmark of that</div>
            God, I presume, does not pull the bottom rung lightly from his house of cards. Nor do I suppose (or suspect) that his ability to do so is very possible, or, moreso, of interest to him. What I take to be true is that he does not contradict himself in any given way, and that to resurrect someone would place such tension between what he otherwise ordained; or at least, doing so (among other interventions) would cause the rest of nature to blunder in response. The notion may be ‘how is it that he resurrected Jesus then?’. Perhaps, as well, his physiological concern was not depleted upon Christ’s revival! “Because he willed, of course!” The logical error here is assuming that because our belief is that this event happened, our understanding of God’s will must fall in line with what we feel to be true. What if we’re wrong though? God may not actually intend to tear physiology out of its common mold, for he may know and therefore rest on the fact that it would in fact be contradictory. He could not resurrect Jesus since the CO2 would have depleted in his lunges, and he’d therefore not be able to re-intake oxygen: or are those who believe otherwise suggesting that Jesus had no need to breathe? 
            <div class="qu">Why do we revere God for all his fine-tuning, but carry ourselves forward as though the arrangement can willy-nilly change? I just don’t get it</div>
            My suspicion, in closing, is that our request of the world to form our opinions and thinking, is too heavily sifted from our point of view, rather than what truly composes the world, and its according offer. This may account for the anthropomorphization born through our grand impressions, and their place being based on an ordering what it is we feel and see to be true. Is the quest of philosophy then -and the equal aim of  science- not to suggest that our vision is off, and then better reroute? 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps the events we do see are worth respecting, even though they were identified without a strong lens (or scrupulous sense); which, in a way, leaves us with an image without color. For the most part though, this may be fine, and for a millennia served us, in both reassurance and unity. Think of the plagues though which were due to a lack of infrastructure (and blamed otherwise), or the pograms which were conducted under the charge of heresy. Are these really sound? Is the truth being amended to properly here, or being discerned well at any rate? Could that image simply be wrong?  ”As the world seems quite thin in its nature and ways without much color, as there is not much depth.”“Is that saturated portrait not the one that better depicts the place in which we exist? Why bear a truth that was rooted in our imagination?”
            <div class="qu">The struggle for the modern man it seems, is to have more value and integrity than those outside religion, who may in fact lack any driving force and according principle, but do so with respect to a truth which was founded on something more than beliefs, testimony, fables or submission</div>

            I like the idea that our aim is happy to be reached in both abundant and appropriate ways. You may find that one side is constricted for the benefit of the other, but I see no need. 
            <br>&emsp;Let’s bring this together with our true mold. We will die surely, but this simply means that our soul will be resting rather than living: the being remains. The principal then, is that we should enter this state with openness and acceptance. From a place of living our being of rest ought not be remissed or sought otherwise: for we stiffen up and, by virtue of the point and the moral of the proposal, that your rest then is tampered -and that being forever means that you are in some way eternally at unease.
            <br>&emsp;What does this mean then? Well, from our being forthright we can see this is coming. Perhaps it is because we recognize our state of activity and are supposing that rest is equally a state, of which our eternal death will be; therein we are becoming inclined to see our living actions as prior to those of our resting state. The central point is that our being remains. If we wish for the tranquil state of it to be properly so, then the steps prior must be proficient within the state of their kind. “Put another way, only if our living state is consistent and true, will the resting state that follows have an equal harmony.” The mark of this being in error is when we tense up and grieve on death’s door -where living appears the only claim, and rest is consequently resisted. How we know that we are living well then is that when it is done, the underlying soul continues into the proceeding rest untarnished, then able to be in that way, fully and truly. 
            <br>&emsp;The question then is what sort of soul do we want during living? There are two things we know. First, we want to be light at the end of it within that state, and that whichever it ought to be during living is what ‘that living and corresponding activity’ is good to give. That latter point is what we must discuss, for it is essentially the heart of our question: what constitutes proper living? Again, it is that which results in a proper soul. To reiterate, that soul which is proper upon death is light rather than stiff -so we may enter rest with tranquility instead of being torn and displeased. “Taking the point to be true that accepting our death for the sake of ease and willingness so that our resting state can be evenly lasting, holds the bearing for what the active states before this are requested to be.”  But, I must admit, that besides our qualification that what is good is so, that a breezy transition occurs, and how this is quite sound, affords me no obvious sight as to what things fit such groove. “In that, my understanding of Man and his ends, is not so comparable to what’s known in his active ways: at least what they should be for the sake of the former.”
            <br>&emsp;What strikes me is this issue, where we assume that the final step before death, when we are in fact still living (by virtue of it being before), is not appropriately considered as part of the steps prior. “It is as if we took the principle to be true, but therein asked how we should be upon maturing to a point where it would then need to be more actively prepared for and addressed.”  As Socrates or Epictetus would say, as Seneca and Marcus remark along with revering those prior who felt the same, to even Montaigne like a modern of old, ‘that this is what you were born to do, and are as a consequence marked in both the destination of it and thus requirement to forever prepare.’ And to those who do, when the deed by tyrants or age is done, they offer themselves knowing there is rest: for their sight and mind is clear, able to anticipate and in finality see it. To that they are truly done. And despite being unsure, the steps prior are at least so that they beckoned, or at least gave respect, to the notice which their regards gave them: that an end is in fact coming. 
            <div class="qu">And perhaps our course, be it in frivolity or sincerity, is to simply keep that in mind</div>
         </div>
         <div id="deartestament">
            So a friend asked me how I know what is right and wrong. I said that God tells me; he then wished me to clarify how I knew that was true: I made a faith filled argument. Now, that is fine, be it of tradition or a baser meaning of faith -rather a literal meaning of it. My interest though is in establishing a position that is based on strength. If you take the former position that is based on faith then it would reasonable to suppose that no merit or basis for amending to it was present, but you believed no less. A rational argument, or one that is bound from thoughtfulness, deliberation and care, may have all the merit in the world yet still lie short. In this case some faith would be required for a certain claim.
            <br>&emsp;Let me put forth an example. The sun goes around the earth from our point of view: will it do so tomorrow? On one end you could say that considering the thinness of your understanding of how it acted as it did already, then you could say that a laudable prediction of how it will act ahead is equally small; however, you could address the fact that accounts of it orbiting trace back nearly thousands of years; moreso could you reference the aging of a tree and the many years it takes to reach maturity, respecting the fact that the Sun seems ever more grander, and this gives some suggestion that it will continue longer than that. The point being then, that although I don’t know how long it will proceed, the scope of what its limit is seems at least bound within a duration longer than, say, a week. In that case, less we were on the edge of its iterations, I am confident that it will rise tomorrow and similarly the following day. Let us come at this from a faith based point of view. When asked if it will rise tomorrow, the person in that view simply says it will; seeing as I spent a fair amount of time trying to explain my own side, I asked them to offer a detail or two as to why they were confident themselves; they, in short, had faith that it would and believed in it therefore. See the difference?
            <br>&emsp;One concern that strikes me from this inquiry is that those of us interested in establishing truth from an inquisitive ground will surely fall short of those whose positions are immediately baked and completed from their place of faith. And it is a mighty difficulty to decipher the value in being less sure, however rational, compared to being so sure, despite being baseless when it comes to observations and understanding. One idea that comes to mind is that those within faith take certain things to be fundamentally true, which in effect encourages their confidence in other possible happenings. A criticism I’d offer is regarding the merit of faith besides a theistic reality. In other words, if the workings and results of the world were in fact natural and relational, as opposed to being willfully suspended, then the faith one had would merely serve as stoutness in the face of unknown effects. “You can see how the removal of intervention spoils the expectations of the faithful as the consequence they face will result from the constant orderings of the world -rather than being controlled benevolently.” At this point faith seems more akin to stoic behavior. “I know not what will happen but have faith that no matter the end I’ll be ok.” Let’s take these terms to be synonymous and fair. The ostensible meaning of faith is that one believes that good things will happen to them due to God’s intervention-whom they have faith will be generous. The issue with this is that the complete idea of God rests on a pantheistic point of view; herein, he is not or cannot be contrary to himself; as it seems from our tactile understanding of what it is he offers, suggests that the intricacies of his being cannot be fiddled with or tampered with. “Unless we think he would or could pull out the keystone card underneath, assuming he was the rest of the deck at least.”
            <br>&emsp;My aim here is not to dispense with theistic faith; rather, I am trying to discern the value in learning the truth in a contrasting way. One of the troubles though is that in seeing the limits of that direction, I am left refuting the alternative option as invalid; perhaps I am doing this on the basis of those rational limits, only that I see them as the only option(and essential in that case). This will explain what I see. If the primary position is one based on inquiry, and this format is limited to strength rather than certainty, then what is the resolve we can make or understanding that we can have that this approach is absolutely true? In this respect, I can offer the world a point of view that is smelted through strength. It can break and will through ignorance or time brittle away, but it is a sword to be used and that is what we need. Moreover, does the faith which we otherwise have, reveal the necessities which we ultimately seek; and I cannot offer an alternative solution that meets those standards. I can however offer a proposal that is rooted in rationality, regarding the issue which that need for absolute guarantees requests. In that case I’d suppose that those amending themselves to something absolute, in both resolve and respect, are simply wishing to achieve salvation. My feeling though is that there is no need to worry about the concerns this issue is rooted in. Foremost do I see it as a result of storytelling, their developments, gregarian strictness and the orthodoxy produced through that and so forth. At this point, I fear the greatest of dialectics. This is not the final issue though, rather I am merely narrow in my ability to determine strength. “The point of reason is not to better know the world so that a more accurate guarantee can be made.” Rather, supposing that we did know more would surely reveal to us how much more there was left; in that case our own limits seem appropriate. And in that case, considering what knowledge we do have and our humble assessment of how much accuracy there is within that, allows us to make a response to the world as our rational, industrious, empirical, thoughtful, inquisitive, gentle, mature, gregarious, humble, liberal, reflective, prospective, sensible and attuned faculties revealed to us to be.
            <br>&emsp;Why is faith wrong though? If it is addressing a higher truth then no wonder it can’t be seen or amended through rationality and minded discernment. To me this is the critical point. That point which we conceive of as absolute and inaccessible to experiment and doubts, in principle, runs forever. “It is not the case that it is some foreign country whose borders we know yet prevents our access to it. Rather it is a land that is imagined to be far from reasons delight and observation.” This is perhaps true. To us though can our amendment to it then be only so from a metaphysical level: it simply cannot be anything more.
            <br>&emsp;It is ludicrous to propose that faith is the only present and active faculty or behavior within the heart and soul of man. The goal of this inquiry is in many ways trying to discern the value of each. In that case, those of us who wish to suspend their need for rational judgment and tend to their faith instead, O.K. We must still recognize what the faith is besides, and therefor the entity which each is in. I draw this point based on the construction one has of that absolute realm, or idea at least. Faith as we are mentioning refers to the trust one has, that it’s either there, or in addition caring. Let’s put divine intervention and its revelations aside. This argument rests on a level wherein nothing was known except that which was around us. We’re on a planet, there is a sun, we can think and consider, of ends and what it needs, wherein faith or reason is applied. I say this, with the assumption that the players and field are the same, under the notion that ‘the absolute’ is a metaphysical and unobservable proposition, whereas the natural world and our place within it from a living to restfull state is the rational position. The question then is which side do we assent to; one which is higher but requires us to trust in it for we cannot know, or that which is approached through strength and uncertainty? Personally, I cannot know in either case; one however encourages my strength whilst the other is so high that faith must be employed to believe in it.
            <br>&emsp;It is worthwhile to mention that sentiment of taking things to be true based on prior conclusions; this, for example, reflects a Christian sentiment that is taken to be true under the agreement of past writings and happenings -biblically or in testimony that is. Now, I would apply this onto the metaphysical assumptions one might make in their depiction of that absolute image. For one, has nothing ever been the totality, or has something always been( in its fundamental form); secondly, does your motivation for employing your faith and its basis on the ‘design and charity’ of reality have any real merit? For one, as they say, why would the introduction of things explicitly mean a choice was made; moreover, does a choice being made make any equal sort of strict notion that the way things are(and are advancing) can be tempered with; as well, seeing as we have a host of those other faculties, why should we assume that our faith onto the creator is more paramount rather than involving those things? Similar to a rock eroding or a star exploding, what suggests that our own death isn’t issued with equal justice and natural necessity?
            <br>&emsp;This brings up the most important point: why are we afraid of dying? First, I am not referring to one’s natural fear and retreat from death; rather, I am focusing on one’s anticipations of heaven or the fear of hell. Initially, it is unclear why either of these are deemed to be true; I suspect it is from stories being turned into fables, which in turn are taken to be genuine sources and bases for knowledge. Religious texts generally have this problem, such as ‘lying is a terrible thing as is theft and perjury: it is so bad, you’d be better off dead’. The point of this is not to fear punishment for these things or that a reverent oblige to commit repentance is necessary if guilty; rather it is a figure of speech that is utilized to emphasize the civil plea to avoid these wrongdoings. Perhaps the positions of our argument are thus revealed. For one, it is said don’t steal, and I may say on one end that you should not because ‘it’ is simply wrong; the alternative side seeks to give a better reason why. The issue though is that the latter bases itself on reference and its basis on pastoral or messianic authority; the former on the other hand seeks to study sociology, economics, politics, psychology etc., and attempts to offer reasons not to perform such acts. This argument is generally placed within the notion ‘there are reasons not to do so for the sake of human survival and prospering’. If you have prior assumptions of rules that rest above this then a position will alternatively be taken there; or at least, a mention will be said why those reasons and factors are ultimately true. That we would know what that highest determinant is with any certainty suggests ill caution; having faith that it is there then is one thing, but defining it is limiting -which is why we must have faith, for we do not know. I will only make one note in this entire book. And that is the fact that in writing technically from a personal point of view, or rather with my feelings besides the lecturing point, offers the least clarity. “And so I hope that the specific elements within, make the whole worthwhile to have produced -even though in total, it is uniquely burgamesh.”
         </div>
         <div id="roomfordoubt">
            Faith marks the fact that we do not know but have trust anyways. What I suspect though is that we are in fact taking things to be true that give our further ideas some credibility. “It’s as if we cannot strictly prove God’s existence or that he is benevolent but see it as genuinely true, but needing faith to fully understand it and thus anticipate the results.” This is a mighty issue for those with these feelings. You simply cannot have your cake and eat it too. How can past knowledge and or experience stand as laudable pillars for your current regard? Your beliefs as they are cannot be of the absolute and grace if there is anything more than faith to get you there. Now, you may act rational and speculative, slightly at least, otherwise your place in the discussion is hypocritical -to take our side of things completely for granted! Stand where you are and abide by the faculties you emphatically choose; I don’t agree with the ignorance of those others but I especially disdain their presumptuous use.
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps this is too tall an order for some. One reason is that in order to have faith in some thing, it must be defined, pictured at least; these illustrations, be it from the divine or not, are of those more sensible and vigorous faculties. That is why I say that your metaphysical view is still subject to reason, for it is an idea based on one. My simple argument against assumptive faith is that the roots and development of it have come out of centuries of anecdotes, gregarian experiences, theistic and hopeful impulses, and in short the groundwork from this that explicitly followed. In other words, our current feelings about the world may in fact seem true despite needing faith in order to attest to the scope of it; however, this position as I’d claim, is still based on premises that are inherently taken to be true. On one end is the assumption of what God is and the necessary congruence towards him; this has been established and culturalized since the writings of the Old and New Testament. That word, testament, is perhaps the kink in faith’s armor. “We take God to be true not because of what others have heard and seen, rather we grant his existence out of faith and explain it through those testaments. The rational man would look at the testaments, see their worth, then add them towards his conclusion.” This you may say is the princiiple of lineage; it describes our state as being one that has been arrived at from the past, and incorporating its steps. I believe that if you look at the development of early man and his transition into organized society, the emergence of formal religion can be reasonably explained; moreso, if you can explain the ways in which ideas and accounts develop beyond their initial fact or intention, then you can see how the premises we take to be true are lavishly false. “What I wish for from someone in this case, is to either act and say, or do so in private, in a way reminiscent of ‘I have no reason to believe this, I’ve given it none and care for no thought: I take it to be true on faith though, no matter if the idea I have of it is unbound through the medium of thinking. My decision is made, my mind’s unnecessary.” The point to be clear is that the grand object which you have your faith towards was constructed using the very faculties which you ignore in resolving yourself to it. “I thought of God and knew him not true; when I stopped questioning it though and just saw him, then to what was seen I believed in -despite any lacking evidence.”
            <br>&emsp;Let’s see if we can be brief and final. We may suppose that there are other things beyond the observations available to us; moreso then, would the continuity and integrity of what we have so far seen wain. I am unsure whether or not this is likely or true. However, when I remove myself from the equation, our position seems ample. Primarily, when the innate issues that fundamentally challenge me come up, our oblige seems sufficient. This, I believe, is the sole determining factor of what makes someone the person they are. If the request is that you die, and that you do so well, then being able to parse this and humbly resolve will see your response as sufficient. In a similar way, if growing muscles demands working out, then the required effort and discipline will seem acceptable: for our understanding of what’s necessary renders the action as just, appropriate, meaningful and warranted. In that case, our death seems to naturally follow our living. Upon reflection, our time within sleep and rest compares to the nothing which our death will be; more or less will our acceptance of this ground our prior living into an obliged state with respect to the dream that follows. In that, the course is fair and opportune -for living within the state prior to rest, bears the corresponding joys of activity as your claim.

         <div id="delta">
            What I think religious people do is extend the width of their ball into all of entirety. The reasons why are not so explicit, but comparing the alternative limit is otherwise warranted. What it comes down to is a state of permanence. Those in that former camp wish to live and rest in the halls of God; and they think that by aligning themselves to his will, that their own essence will be plastered in his realm of existence. "I say with even the most minor of assurances, that there is grave weakness in this claim; for it in many ways runs contrary to what He himself intended, or that you otherwise could if it were what he even wished." Perhaps that is why he arranged us the way that he does, as he could not give us the life of him. "And God seldom runs contrary."
            <br>&emsp;The point then, is that if we cannot reach this permanent state, then an impermanent one is what we are more clearly ordained to and thus right to achieve. This way has many woes however, as living in a small space can be cumbersome. However, we must be distinct when we regard our local pursuits of reasoning upon the whole of the world, as one which is merely illustrative, rather than an objective itself. "For even if we could see the lands and will of God, are we divine?" It seems that our wish to do so is a result of our otherwise encumbrance, yet Buddha's belief that this only arises through ignorance suggests that our righteous place is not in abandoning those lands which we are clueless in. Instead of painting an absolute picture, let us merely draw one which has an all encompassing depth: but remains from our point of view. This has much ontological reasoning behind it, as well as ones of effective theology and sense; but nevertheless, we can say that our place within this domestic state is ultimately an impermanent one. "Thus we must arrange ourselves to be in accordance with that, rather than extending ourselves for the sake of what such a habitation would provide."
            <br>&emsp;Put another way, the higher claims of permanence do not make it more just, nor do the limited gains from impermanence not remove its value. "For we ought only do better, whereby the removal of ignorance that would let us do so, would in itself show us and instate a reward worthwhile and appropriate."

         <div id="buddha">
            Let's give a brief overview of Buddhism, then we'll get specific. Founded by Siddhartha Gautam, Buddhism was a Sramana movement that found its developments during the second urbanization of Iron age India. During this time the Upanishads of the Vedic religions were being developed as well as the world becoming generally more urban and mercantile. The core of its practice(being sramanic) was one rooted in personal toil, exertion, devotion and austerity. Compared to the Brahamic religions (namely Hinduism), Buddhism was more of a philosophical movement. Jainism and Ajivika are its contemporaries in that regard. Within Buddhism there are two primary paths -to liberation, or Marga(as it's called). One, is the Theravada school which emphasizes one's attainment of nirvana(or extinguishing); its aim is in ending the cycle of death and rebirth(samsara). Secondly, there is the Mahayana school which aims at becoming a bodhisattva, as to benefit all sentient beings -through bodhicitta. Theravada(the school of Elders) is more prevalent today in southern Asia -including Sri Lanka and the countries near Burma- whereas Mahayana(Great Vehicle) is more prominent in northern Asia -including Japan(in the form of zen), China, Taiwan, Korea and Nepal.
            <br>&emsp;The general objective of a Buddhist is to achieve liberation from anitya(impermanence), dukha(dissatisfaction or suffering) and anatman(absence of lasting essence). What is to be avoided is samsara, or the cycle of rebirth; this is caused by craving things and being attacked -this is dukkha. Those aversions from prior are the result of this. This notion marks the first of the four truths given by Buddha -and as recorded in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta upon his first sermon regarding these. The second of these truths is samudaya, which emphasizes what comes from these cravings; in other words, the dukkha brings on samudaya, and saturates one with suffering(and the placement within samsara). To combat this, Nirodha marks the cessation and suppression of those cravings, or dukkha, and in turn the samudaya that follows. Additionally, we can say that the clinging from dukkha creates karma 'as if you are digging yourself into a hole and likely more troubled to get out of it'; consequently, by removing the hole, or karma that is by ceasing the additions to it -and assuming the skhandas(or baggage) that were there swell down- leads one to a point where there is no more craving: this is Nirvana. Then, upon death, parinirvana is obtained as the transfer from living to death is achieved without rebirth. "In a way, the hungers of our minds heat it up, and in effect lead us to a point where inflammation occurs; moreso, are we without the graces of goods and impressions that come into our cooled mind. For these are the elements which don't stick onto us as we are not aligned with them. In that we are without self and empty, only experience." The fourth truth refers to the path to achieve this enlightenment. Called magga, or the middle way, this route is one based in the Noble Eightfold path, where right characteristics are aimed at being demonstrated, the result being the removal of samudaya(thirst) and its root cause(dukkha) by the way of Nirodha(cessation). If successful, Nirvana will be reached and the flame of suffering will be quenched; in turn, a quiet freedom and peaceful happiness will come through -this being Moksha(or Vimukti). Having achieved this freedom, one is considered a Bodhi.
            <br>&emsp;With that overview in mind, we can briefly reflect on what we further seek. For example, Mahapanna marks 'Great Wisdom' and is just one of many ethics and or qualities in Buddhist Sanskrit. This seems remarkably appealing to discover. "Great Compassion(as Maha-karuna) is another example." As it stands, the historical aspect of Buddhism seems less pressing; that is, the texts, origins of Buddha himself and his lineage of teachings and schools: the actual tenants and philosophy feel more important. We can admittedly find admiration and insight from how he lived, but the scholarly roots of the schools and text feel like precision works, whereas our effort now is probably best spent into the core pillars of the overall model -as opposed to chartering when, where, from whom and how it was built. "Show me the David and I will confess interest towards Michaelangelo." Building on that, would our focused study of India and its political history give us the relevant context and means for seeing Buddhism's uprising -when we reached the Mahajampas. Second then, is the practice of Buddhism. This is similar in terms of those foremost ideals, but the emphasis here is on the practice of reaching them(through meditation and reflection etc.) as well as its social nature(in Sanghas). This is fairly personal to me, as at least one thread within the heart of my aim regarding these religious studies, is to see how others conducted themselves personally and with others. "I will be accomplished if I learn, am inspired or simply see the self respect from another being devout, in communion with others who are comparably ordained. This is enough from Buddhism, Christians, and or reason itself." Lastly, are the inquisitive aspects of Eastern thought. Buddhism holds a great deal here, but ideas are what I am seeking and so Hinduism and other schools are equally welcomed. In this case, the Brahman, Dharma, soteriology, ontology, eschatology, intervention, absence, ostensibly etc., are all bursting with opportunities to gain insight and utility towards our own English affairs. Rounding out the heart of Buddhism though feels most appropriate; and hopefully in that case we can give our thought to what it and its elements effectively reflect.
            <div class="qu">One current suspicion, is that the idea of Karma simply addresses the conjuring of our natures as we learn more, and how in vying for things outside it, as if the whinning kid now had a gun, makes us foolish and vain. Karma remarks that ridding ourselves of these ignorant impulses will leave us free and empty. What I would say, is that we merely need a better stake, as if we were producing fairly conceived thoughts that reflected the good in the world as one who is sound and grateful sees it. The Buddhist way though does seem to address the limits of our nature forming from nothing, intellectually that is: for we always come short. My belief though is that the issue is not the approach, rather the awareness that you are in one. And in being so inclined, can the good that we seek become staked on what is congenial to the reason we've acquired, as opposed to making for innate ends by these stronger means</div>
         </div>
         <div id="brahma">
            Buddhism in fact contrasts with Vedic beliefs that there is an all encompassing god. In that later case there is Brahma, while in Buddhism there is Pratityasamutpada, which etymologically combines one's insight and belief in the truth of something, and in this case onto the causality by which things rise and cease. Dharma then to the Buddhist is a means to alignment with this flow of things 'as to cross the river', then let the raft go. The key difference between Buddhism and Hinduism is that the latter believes in a higher working principle(Brahman and Rta) which upon adherence(or dharma) fills one up, as if there is a link between existence and man(atman); on the other hand Buddhism believes in a non self, that is one that is unattached (anatma) and able to proceed without clingings or cravings. Instead, their view is that things happen by cause and effect rather than an intelligent governor. The point about Pratityasamutpada then is that because the Buddhist aim is not to 'cross the river and hold the boat', they need only see how things effectively are within some relation to themselves; their action then that corresponds to that, in contrast to a lasting position amongst the whole of things, results in a dharmic harmony of release and impermanence(nirvana).
            <br>&emsp;Vedic ontology and theology does carry ideas itself, but they are merely unfounded if joy is our aim. Simply, if one's wishes to appease God, they never will; though the idea that there is something high and absolute gives less demand that someone use their deliberate attention as in the Buddhist case. The latter will never feel full and completed, only that they are at best in a gentle state(nirvana) before their lasting end(parinirvana), while the former will feel complete and one, permanently mind you, yet at the mercy of their natural impermanence. "For Buddhism, one can simply recede from life's longing and reach an experience of Moksha and ending parinirvana. The one who otherwise believes in and resolves themselves to the highest principle(Brahman) will only do so prominently; this is not a poor thing to understand, only if the depiction of these higher orders are illustrated as being governed by supreme benevolent beings and creators, then the attempt of reconciliation will be one where absence is not merely an aversion, but fear, as the answer to the deities call is forgone; moreso then, does the harmony with Brahma leave one without the goods of Dharma in any kind, as their plea was not to experience wellness and joy, but remission from sin."
            <br>&emsp;Admittedly, the aims of nirvana and Brahmic alignment are two sides of the same coin. Their slight contrast though marks a more significant difference between religions and other philosophies in general. Effectively, our happiness can be larger if it is from a higher being, yet what occurs is that we ingratiate the form of it with something which explains it. "It's as if we must depict a god or creator to imagine the workings of nature beyond ourselves." These portrayals though are not the positive means that we seek, for they corrupt us with fear of things based on a watching eye, rather than what is good in itself. Put another way, it seems that a more local awareness of how things are as they pertain with you is a more practical and sensible mold to align oneself with; while the former approach is eventually made up, this latter merely aligns to nature as it directly pertains to us. "Ought we not take the bagel because it is poor and unduly sought for, compared to ignoring its use and error by our intent to some other divine harmony."
            <br>&emsp;The key thing, is that a Brahmic resolve is one where reality is infinite and eternal, and that being in line with that would bring us the most, while being one with the simple passings of our day seems comparatively small. The thing, is that our divine illustration is the only thing which can describe what that higher order is and what it requires. These depictions are in effect untrue, and thus eventually poor in what they provide. "For the actions in our life as people are what give us good and bad, as crime is good to be absent from as is friendship great to be in the presence of; we may in fact be satisfied and attuned to the molds of God's will, but ways of our actual nature are not addressed. For we must eat, we must run, were better to think and be good with relations built from this; these things take that passive time and care to amend to and cultivate: and religious folk simply don't prioritize that -for that aim rather, as they appease more than recieve."
            <br>&emsp;The key point is not that a Buddhist cant have a large view of the world; Buddhist theology generally does. These are scaffoldings though, climates around our local matters which serve as a cloudy border by which the whole of our regard operates; it always comes back to us though, and how our mind can become nirvanic, rather than attached. And those of religion paint the world in a more explicitly large form, with the governor and laws to boot. This is incongruous with our actual wish for rest and being. The difference being that the latter finds a constant challenge in amending to the absolute, while the former merely floats inside a more loosely stitched bound of vastness, and instead brings the principal of those outskirts to their more local being, wherein the value of anatman and bliss measure the most relevant of affairs. "God in converse, is merely made so one 'can' care about something higher, rather than centering in on themselves."
            <br>&emsp;A last point I would make then, is that being high and absolute is no issue in itself, only that we don't try and surpass it, or reach it at least: for our place behind it initially suggests that we necessarily will not. Knowledge can be good, and in effect gives us more room and space to address ourselves in; but the mold should not match our casing, 'as if being a citizen of the country meant you were in line with the direct orders of the court'. Simply be one with the land; know its borders so that you don't feel so small, but use wisdom to garnish this knowledge as to more easily rest in the smaller findings that your in. "To me, Buddhist's bend towards the truth in the matter, however conceived their core tenants are; for it is the heart of the matter that counts, and the gift of joy and impermanence credits it the most."
            <div class="qu">If there were a sphere, and it was hollow and small, then so too would the elements inside ignite(as if embers) by density and pressure. Contrary to that, is a more open space, where things can float more easily and smooth; consequently, there is less room for you to become inflamed, as well as a more tempered and fruitful space for better feelings and cares to cultivate</div>
            What I think religious people do is extend the width of their ball into all of entirety. The reasons why are not so explicit, but comparing the alternative limit is otherwise warranted. What it comes down to is a state of permanence. Those in that former camp wish to live and rest in the halls of God; and they think that by aligning themselves to his will, that their own essence will be plastered in his realm of existence. "I say with even the most minor of assurances, that there is grave weakness in this claim; for it in many ways runs contrary to what He himself intended, or that you otherwise could if it were what he even wished." Perhaps that is why he arranged us the way that he does, as he could not give us the life of him. "And God seldom runs contrary." The point then, is that if we cannot reach this permanent state, then an impermanent one is what we are more clearly ordained to and thus right to achieve. This way has many woes however, as living in a small space can be cumbersome. However, we must be distinct when we regard our local pursuits of reasoning upon the whole of the world, as one which is merely illustrative, rather than an objective itself. "For even if we could see the lands and will of God, are we divine?" It seems that our wish to do so is a result of our otherwise encumbrance, yet Buddha's belief that this only arises through ignorance, suggests that our righteous place is not in abandoning those lands which we are clueless in. Instead of painting an absolute picture, let us merely draw one which has an all encompassing depth: but remains from our point of view. This has much ontological reasoning behind it, as well as ones of effective theology and sense; but nevertheless, we can say that our place within this domestic state is ultimately an impermanent one. "Thus we must arrange ourselves to be in accordance with that, rather than extending ourselves for the sake of what further habitations would provide." Put another way, the higher claims of permanence do not make it more just, nor do the limited gains from impermanence not remove its value. "For we ought only do better, whereby the removal of ignorance that would let us do so, would in itself show us and instate a reward worthwhile and appropriate."
            <br>&emsp;Let our studies resume then. As I have said prior, having more sensibility to the scope of the world is not a poor mark upon you, only that it should at most furnish your own local affairs, rather than be a progressive end in its own right -for those borders, however defined, will never be reached. In that, ought we incorporate ideas of that more personal living, as well as that of the whole we are illustrating. A quick point is worth adding. We tend to view entirety as a conceptual idea, whereas the bounds of space that we can see reflect more concrete bounds to the objects in question. "What entirety would be compared to what it is. The former though is limitless, and thus encourages mere valid deductions, while the latter is limited by virtue of its origin from our point of view: wherein only suggestion and likelihood is rightly permitted." In that, we need not know the whole for we have no aim(as our ability reflects) to act upon it. We may understand it more or less, but the borders of what it amounts to is a land we can never reach. The point though is that it is worthwhile to know what is in and around your borders. And admittedly it is serviceable to have terms that mark the whole of things, in principle or being that is; the use for these though is to wrap the things that we do know, wherein the entirety that we know can be assessed under the guise of entirety's form, while also remaining true to our own measurable limit. Practically speaking, Buddhism offers one the insight on how to locally be, while Vedic culture, or Brahmic religions rather, serve as those insights into the higher molds. "Again though, we merely wish to ask what things we know fit that higher reality. The former though, being better understood under the objective measure, is the subject and point of our resolve, rather than trying to extend ourselves to reach the borders of the objective measure itself." Perhaps our study in these Vedas will be best with such an aim in mind. "For we may otherwise be sucked into thinking that it's true. Or preferred over the nature of man for that matter."
            <br>&emsp;As a proxy for Brahmic thought, let us dive into Hinduism. For one, it is clear that in its case or Buddhism, that these are Dharmic practices. Simply, there are beliefs in how the world operates; the former tends to believe it is directed under a governing principle, while the latter holds causality as the key. Dharma though, means that in whichever case, that one attempts to align themselves with that guiding principle. In Hinduism's case, the goal is Atman, which is unity of their self with Brahman(the principle). Dharma is how they achieve this, with Purushartha being the objectives by which their actions become propper. Now, Brahman is the highest principal, of which Atman is indistinguishable; the difference is that the latter remarks the self of a thing, which in alignment becomes one with Brahman. There is a note though of limitation that this harmony can be reached, only approached. Nevertheless, there is a notion of Parabrahman, which marks aspects of reality which are beyond recognition, or lacking attributes. You might say that this reflects things which cannot be considered. In a similar way, Rta reflects the workings of the world; in a sense, it is the manifestation of what we see. Brahman is the underlying groove by which things slide, but into what sort of figure or form, Rta is the sum total of all that; and in effect makes that Purushartha subject to it as the objects of amendment. "Brahman gives the world its constitutional being, yet what it becomes is not so clear itself. Faith though is that the results are governed (while Buddhists believe they are from cause and effect), and to whichever end, say in economics or civil living, does our practical response assent to those. Purushartha reflects those objective reponses, while our principal self in line with Brahma, brings us out in a more fundamental way -wherein those practical actions manifest from, and towards." In a way, the bliss(ananda) that one reaches through this higher alignment is one of extension, as if their being is spread out over entirety -and in effect permanent. Buddhism on the other hand, is much more compact and local, in that our understanding of the world is one that removes us from wishing for or needing such extension or permanence; rather onto what manifests itself to us locally, we can simply be with that. Moreover, as those manifestations run in line with our active nature, then so too will we happily be. Moksha then marks the state of good within the latter, while the Hindus seek the bliss from extension. Additionally, there is the point of Satcitanada, which reflects one's experience of being in line with Brahman. An issue though is that if such an experience is placed, then so too would it fit within the domain of all personal experiences. Corresponding to that, is if our hand were on a flame it would be poor, as our nature is against this, while water for instance is not. The point, is that if our state upon true Atman is placed amongst our more natural forms of being too, then are we really besides the latter even if were in the former? "Are we not still men if we beith with Gods, or Brahman that is? If so, then what goods are there as each, as our peace and care for the latter is not acquired necessarily by the means and resolve to the former." The limits of extension then seem most relevant here; but we will let those notions drip a little, and come through our writings ahead.
            <div class="qu">Though I don't mind the concept of this extension, I believe it eventually runs its course as our active natures come into fruition. Moreso, as Rta for example, reflects the way things are as they manifest, then I am still unconvinced that these explanations of principal governance are anything more than abstract concepts aimed at giving a groove for certainty. For just as Rta reflects the way things are, so too is there an ontological term called Tanmatras, which in themselves mark 'subtle elements' which give rise to gross ones. Ostensibility seems to relate here explicitly. Consequently, does our need to cement the views of all that is ahead bring us away from the natures we have, that come from those principles which are otherwise indescribable. Giving them arms and legs though, merely seems self serving; rather than relating the core point of fundamentals in a suggestive sense, and resolving ourselves to be personal, yet with those absolute borders gently in mind. "As opposed to an infinite world in which I loosely cement myself onto, I would rather be in a relatively (but merely) wide world, truly, yet within so as my self, impermanently."</div>

        <div id="relations">
            I've met a woman; at the very least I see one. My history has only dealt me warranted disappointment in this regard. The cause is fairly clear, and the reason is, although somewhat less so, equally clear in kind. What I mean is that we overestimate our interest in other people, and equally their interest in us. The reason, is that we want someone; the root of our failure is we never try and get. How I would explain that is as follows. I mean to live as a consequent response to our idly retched youth. Moving from there, I wished to do more in that newly founded way, but it was hard. For one reason and some others, I wished the world to be easier so that I may reach that purer expression; the aim of that was, in some sense, to be rewarded for such efforts 'so that I would be able to further prosper'. In that case, it seems that our learned autonomy became one of need, akin to someone struggling for air. Unfortunately, we failed to assimilate the whole hearted way in which we sought to do it -and thus the demonstration and reverence for it was not within the spirit of the actual action, of goodness that is. In other words, as if we were clenching for the good because we were so previously struck by the bad, we never reached it, because the real good required a genuine approach - whereas our attempt lacked any righteous integrity
            <br>&emsp;Bringing us back to the point, that need for the good reflected my pure aim of demonstrating myself, but I was ingenuine in my attempt to do so; consequently, the trials of the world squeezed me out. At the forefront, was the desire for a woman as relief. Accompanying this, was the unflinching reverence to the good, but the impure make for it due to it being learned as a means of coping, rather than an aim sought for its own right. Therein, was I staked permanently towards a place in which I would not venture to elsewhere acquire, but improperly holding the post; consequently, was my need to relieve the effects of my errors manifested in the foremost means in which I could receive it: through a woman. What a woman wants and needs is its own discussion, but lets just say your focus must be in some ways towards her, deliberately. To clarify, what I wanted from the woman was that which would give me relief on my elsewhere goal; this amounted to sex, security and comfort. However, this should not be confused with what there is that a woman can offer. Particularly, we sought something from others in general, but leaned towards the goods of a woman: especially when the seemed to pair with that sounder path. "As it were, sex and fun alongside reason seemed the best thing: but life has a way of wringing both sides of a contrary towel dry."

        <div id="simron">
            I leant in and gave her a kiss. At first she was still, then leaning into me further. I held place, softly scoring her lips gracefully by my side. She looked at me and I her, gently stairing into eachothers eyes. "Do you know what you've done," I said. She glared to the side, but replied "No, what is it?" I also looked down, but was ready to return forth: "You've met a man, and I am now one who can be so better." "Do you know what I have done?" she did not reply. "I have met a woman. And do you know what that means for you? You can be a better one as well." She turned her head as if some call had stirred her away; we were here though and of an address there was one she was happy, however unsure to to make. "this will never work," she said, "I have to much on my plate. I am not sure where or what this could be." I held her hand, and smiled. "Theres very little you could do for me, and theres is not that much I would ask or need of you. I just want you to know I care: and I want to know that you feel the same. If theres no time then lets accept that we are on our own, but together. That is what I want, it is the marbling of the comfort and security I seek. Perhaps then we would grow together to be as close as one: hopefully though, we will still be with eachother, together on our own however, is it green and good to be forever one." I have faith that she will smile and say 'O.K'. If she does then we will fortunately know, that be it at home in our hand, we are there; for even as I hope that when we cannot see, we'll at least know that we each onto the other care. And that is where I rest and lay.
            <br>&emsp;I am going to assume that Simron does not like me. She could, but I have only shown affection. If that itself turns out to bring us toether in a more clear and lasting way then I am fine and good on that. I believe i have mistaken though that these purer interests are meant to acquire something more vain and formal. Case in point, I made a direct call of seeing her latter; she replied with a almost flattered sentiment, but one of confusion. It is as if I have mistaken her acceptance of my caring with the plea to demonstrate that I like her more prominently; therein are my advances beyond that wholesome affection ones of uncertainty and weirdness. We are better off flirting like real mature adults, where we should our care through the calm relishment of eachother at our posts. I have no interest in being a item or a thing; furthermore, am I uninterested in running forth as to solidify something and materilazie it. If I were to reflect on that situation with Nicole, we rushed in and realized that we were wrong. If we had waited, it would have been more clear to me that she was only interested in being my friend: and I would have glady accepted that to. Consider yourself the best, and one who is trying to achieve and be everything that the want to do; do not think though that because there is room for frivality that it is warranted, or better yet to be regrettted if you are not. It is there for those who wish upon it, but the rest of the world is working on their buisness and pursuits - so each memebr may improve and raise their lives. There is enough to form a relationship on purer and sounder experineces. The worse thing to do is act like your not interested in that bravose way, but then flounder your way with the hopes of achieving the same. I know why your sad, for being so light in our interactions may not yeild us anything at all. Let there be the world for you then: and perhaps our settlement through that will procurr a lasting rise of those sweeter impressions, and leave you with something worthwhile and rounded.
            <br>&emsp;If Simron is vain then she may be struck by anothers brevity and make way for her. If she is not though then I feel like a pure connection moves beyond our common feelings. In their case, she might say that she doensnt have the time or capacity to be so formally interested and in love; if it was purely based on character and natural affection, then we would need not address the limitations set within our lives. In our case then would I advise that you not worry if she is unresceptible. I get to treat her well and nothing more; if she is inclined then were are set for a wholesome heart; she may not be so mature though, or is otherwise placed within a concentrated effort elsewhere. In any case though, I would remove any wearyness on the notion that she will be strung up by some other guy: it is neither what you are meant to do or what I personally wish to achieve: moreso is she likely not the kind for this and is thus more acceptable for our irreverant interest. Therein would I rest on the simplicty that you find in showing her affection - just dont rush it though
            <br>&emsp;I'd like to talk about love for one second. When she speaks to me, I try and listen without throwing something back at her; I simply say 'I understand', or 'alright'. You have to let someone in so that there joy can be expressed; that is how love is made, for just as you are interested in being generously the same, so will she be there if she has had the oppertunity to treat you similarly. I fear though that there is no where for me to so reticent; as well, is there no patience required from me. The world, however, offers such a scenario where here composure is worthwhile to humbly treat; moreoever, can you bear what she has to say, and return with a lighter remark - a smile perhaps.
            <br>&emsp;Simron and me are not going to work out. THis is a good thing though. I dont want to be joined at the hip or within some formal arrangment. I want us to be initmate and clear because the time we spend together is one out of interest and our own desire: rather than it being soemthing we ought to, or in some cases have to do. "As i have expressed, I am no longer looking for those more glamourous rewards from our sounder efforts. Those purer kinds of action may not lead you to something otherwise, neccessarily, but we can at least and be reassured that the course we followed and the results that we gained, were from being ourself. If Simron and I are to truly be togehter, then it should as ones who are onw there own, but sharing." A particular example I would draw is that our view of eachother is somewhat situated by our postion together; in that sense, she is this girl that I see from time to time and nothing more. However, when i do see her, I am approrpiralytey kind and affectionate, while also letting her act similarly - I hear what she has to say, and let her hear what I am saying. Therein, would our other collugues view of oursevles be taken from the interactions of two people who are not circumstanitally ordained. In other words, it is our regularity of natural interest that shows and marks our current state of relationship along with the way it will develop - she will continue to be that girl who I see amidst others and the world. Therefore, my understanding is that it is within that limited scope where we are brought togehter, that I would treat her the way I would if I truly meant to see her forever. Therein, there is no rush or regret - so long as our situation remains.
        </div>
        <div id="humble">
            My assessment following this is that we are overall fine. In our heart there may be frivolity and remorse, but it is to no lasting prevail. Simron will either gradually respond towards our truest self, or treat us not to either this or something otherwise vain: in that, I do not otherwise care. In terms of prospects the ground is settling; moreover, are we bringing ourselves into a more prominent state where we have more to offer and give. Therein does the receding demands of us and our increasing ability to address them in whatever required way, feel more acceptable and approved; thus, my sight on friendship has more stake as we can more outwardly and genuinely be -thus attracting whomever would share an interest by my side. As well, does our hope for erecting the means for a community seem more operable, as both our skills and clarity have solidified, and we are thus more able to productively proceed.
            <br>&emsp;In other words, when it comes to the world and our tribute ahead, the lane is open to us more and more, and we are increasingly capable. "It is as if our rate of income is furthering whilst the cost of production is lowering: therein are the finances of our heart and mind becoming more neat and easily tidy." Furthermore, I would add that due to this natural and gracious equanimity, our vanity is losing its place. For too long have we been concerned about the probable cause of our genuine efforts to treat us with ingenuine rewards. Simply put, they should not be regarded, either in our humility or direction: only the good shall have our mind and way.
            <br>&emsp;Regarding the bones of this all, the whole is feeling good. In terms of our ability our diet and training are rounding themselves well; especially and, moreso, are they(however immature) of a full and encompassing kind. It is true for example that our pushups are still in a minor state, but that they are viable for regular treatment is both true and reminiscent of our use of it. In other words, we are doing the right things well across the board and simply using a sounder side of our brevity and a more wholesome version of our strength, so we may make it through the shortcomings that correspond with those things being an incomplete case of themselves. In doing so, however, are they firming up, and, consequently, I am beginning to feel a more permanent state of spryness and rigor, evenly I might add. Adding onto that is the sound place of our diet and its consistent treatment of our position. "As a thing which is a hallmark of uncertainty and need for adjustment, it is settling into my liking and extending out as to make it more malleable, whilst keeping stability within its central core." Effectively, I have addressed two usfull times for kinds of eating. First, there is the place for veg and light food. During this period you are set to work and read, train and write, and in association eat tuna, salads, fruit and other veg. Upon the reach of this is a rinse of it all required before moving on to the nourishment of the day. In that case, giving yourself a poignant rest will relinquish the system from the effort built up through the day and allow it to proceed into the latter evening with a lightened freshness. Effectively, when you begin to eat your starch and grain they are not intruding onto a finished state - where you would otherwise be left in a heavied haze. Instead, the body is reaffirmed and betted from the rinse and given more openings for that hearty nourishment to be had through the latter portion of the day. How it ends is not so strictly clear, but a similar place for veg has my approval once the evening has come to a close and the night is beginning to wake. In that case, carrots, almonds, tea and other minor versions of veg are acceptable and, moreover, congenial to our satisfying interests as we wind down into the end of our day. This contrasts nicely with the sullied grievance of having rice or bread near and around nine; in that case you are left with a sense of sulkiness, as well as a remission to rest and go to bed. Sleep is desired but it is of a sluggish kind. Your better set is within a stout yet lightened slate wherein some minor food was munched upon, leaving you with a more wholesome gaze onto the walks, writing, stretch and cheer that more preferably ends an otherwise great day.
            <br>&emsp;All that being said, there is the actual reason for this to tend to. In the case of provisions, as for health I have already said, our job is going similarly well. To propose what this is for though is best met with an elaboration of what it is I wish for these duties to treat. Herein, I am currently set on developing a definition board. As a prior, we had set up 'objective' boards, wherein we expanded upon our goals and desires and subjected ourselves to how we wished to spend our time, as well as what we wanted to do and accomplish. The definition board is an extension of these particular points into a further sentiment of what they actually are. For example, we have said that films are worth our treatment and we have given several that we mean to see; what we already know and are prefaced towards in vying for in each, is less exposed and understood -clearly stated at least. What is best then is, in some sense, to elaborate on what it is you wish to tribute towards. For example, in the case for There Will Be Blood, I would foremostly like to express my admiration and care for the reality that the film expresses, wherein the gritted and gluttunous violence of outlaws in gangs (in a western setting) is avoided and, instead, is replaced with a more seemingly accurate and responsible depiction of a world which is quiet and kind, and if not so, is marred by personal defects in ones character and what consequences those brings. "Seeing people subject to mere stupidity feels unantagonistic, and rests with my lovely view of the world -whereas drama and vile caricature does not." Compared to an otherwise illustration of a violent world through the guise of drama and common assessment, There Will Be Blood shows me that forever on as time goes and all that it has ever been, has been fair and light in the commons, and that all trouble was scorned from our own poor decisions, and equally dealt with within the frame of our character'd demands. Therein, does this quality portrayal of the world reflect that more gregarious and sound sentiment 'that no matter the fortune or trial, it is irreverent in the scale and thus, measured by us and how we choose to treat it'. This is my feeling about There Will Be Blood. There is a good performance by Daniel Day Lewis, as well as a palpable narrative that reflects the expected consequences of ambition -as the title suggests, and Daniel shows. As well, is it just full of details that interest my mind, and is thus definable within my measure of the subject, that being the film in this case or some show of another. These are merely the terms though, the subjects: it is their meat on the bone that reflects their further meaning and thus my interest. Onto that of all the parts and kinds, is what the definition board seeks to, and like the objective is able to, elaborate on and find. In other words, if the world is such and we are keen to see it, then drilling in what it is that we see is understandable when it comes to the possibility of future tribute: for we will then have had to give our sculpture a figure defined. "Which gives my creative avarice much clarity to proceed."

            We are here, at our home in Kamloops: living with Mom and Dad -Dora and Boots too. The area around is banked towards our mind and goodness, along with accommodations for serious training. Food seems agreed upon and set within frequent acquisition. "As I have begun to say, dried fruit before bed is proficient, whereas popcorn, treats of bread and or french fries and springrolls, are all sufficient -whereas sweets and sugar, ignorant drug use, starch and grain before bed, 'and the attempt to step outside yourself as compared to dining on and forever bringing forth what reflects your constitution' are each ill sufficient."
            <br>&emsp;For the sake of discursiveness, I can say that our formal efforts fall in line with developing a website that marks the brand of Ryan Michael Green. As well, developing our Twitter book and all its elements will see suitable promise and additions to our clarity -due to the condensed and or topical nature. Following this are direct initiatives into the professional world; whether it is in the scope of Yoga, Photography, writing or programming, the buildings and people involved serve as ripe opportunity to show off your skill and, in return, earn people's attention and interest of both noticing us and offering collaborative efforts(more or less). Similarly, will taking our writing that we have already done, editing it as to be sharp and defined, then putting it onto Medium, Linkedin and other appropriate websites, will offer us a comparable means of showing our efforts and, again in turn, receiving the supposed profits and rewards. "I'd remark what Emerson says where he defines the great man as one who brings himself fully forth, consistently, on his own or in the crowd. What he goes on to further say and what I take this to effectively mean is that if we mean to be strong and true then we must hold ourselves accountable and resolute, as if we mean to and are happy to do so indefinitely.
            <br>&emsp;Considering the nature of friendship and privilege I can say that these things find their fit to the proper suiter; that is to say that whether they are present or not, our steps towards ourselves remain. Therein, will our forward expression merely rest on the fact that we are trying to be and produce the best version of ourselves; so much as we are fortuned or powerful will those goods we seek settle by our side; they are not the aim though, per say, as our fundamental line is where we primarily meet. These gains of ours are merely the crust in which our inner demonstrations are followed, 'as if they are molding themselves like moss on a solidifying tree'. My point is that although the sun's rise and our leisurely increase from a friend is worthwhile and appreciated, they are merely what makes our advances an accomplishment: they themselves cannot be sought. Instead, our effort should go(as said) towards bearing ourselves through the world in the most constituted and wonderful way. The point being that even if this treated you to the bounty of a king, you'd still be a man. And good for it because in whichever offer you gained, would reason and grace nestle it into your side wherein the treats would be lasting and scrumptious -by that sense and appreciation. The flipside of this are those acquisitions that see the one who reached them left at the door; I would say that those things which are truly good are those which measure up to one who remains forever with themselves. "The rewards then that you receive from this well founded point, will thus stay as actual profits to the suiter: that is, the vessel for the offer to take. Or in other words, if you remain wholesome and true, will things that you receive continue their possibility of offering their goodness: for the applicant of their service has stayed."

            There is very little that is asked of me. Sometimes we have to drive to get food, or at a rare moment there is a request to shovel or help someone move. Generally though we are at home, whether reading or playing, or out and about on walks or a run. The mold for this is cruel from all the requirements it offers us, 'promising that if we abide then riches will be mine'. And I dance with this devil, a little, but I only give a gracious smile: for if he takes me, then the wish for peaceful and lasting goodness will defer to a more red and hotly ambitious aim.
            <br>&emsp;There is good infront of me, like a field of interest and joy that I move through as I continue to further and be. "It is those steps which you naturally take that deserve our attention." In the core is a respect that determines how the field is experienced; this, in short, refers to one's values and appreciation, wherein those that you have will more actively spark what you experience and see. However, this amounts to our inner reasoning and desire. This is important, but merely preliminary, a warm up if you will, or strategy rather. What we need far more than this -principally and seeing as the former has been given all the time and effort- is something that shapes our universal ability to proceed at all, and take whatever it is that we seek in. In other words, we ought to know how to pass a ball and where to run if a certain goal or object is our aim; on the field though, we need sharpness in our mind, a strength of character to remain both heads up and composed, yet relaxed and stress free(as there is in fact no competition).
            <br>&emsp;"By definition will our primary ethic suppose that our factual interests and direction will correspond to our agency and progressiveness." What this amounts to is tailoring the objects of one's mind and inborn nature as to calibrate itself to 'reasonable things, and thus goodnesss', so that our heartfelt steps run in such accordance. "We should mold ourselves so that when our activity takes, or our attention is grabbed, that it is more tuned towards things that were previously seen to be good -from which we determined through more deliberate and rational times." This may be our easiest illustration. You will wake up, then have brunch, lunch, dinner and a closing snack or two; you will then go to bed and do it all over, without question. Those of us with more free time, or at least an open amount to be considerate, will read some books, write some essays or reflection, stretch a little here and likely workout a lot more over there; and to each and all, for better and worse, will some thing at the very least be done, and relevant to goodness if it is agreeable to our living aim. "That is exactly what one ought to, for the sake of benefit, wholeheartedly do."

            I moved up here because my dad was sick; moreso was his immediate treatment the main facilitator in me being so quick to transition. Currently though it is as if the situation is not the case. The cancer as I know it is still there, though, there has been a note that the severity of it is not so strong; put another way, the presence of it is alarming and, moreso, is representative of an almost necessary doom: it is just not going to be tomorrow. Beyond my actual place here and what effects that, I can still say that my Mom and Dad are looking to travel. The fact that I am here is both a means for them to do so or, at the very least, reflects the fact that this is what they ultimately mean to do. This is good. Beyond my dad's sickness and treatment, the resolve to travel in the near future is one that sees my position secure -as it is valued based on the support that my being here offers them in their pursuit to travel[so that I may look after the house and cats]. That being said, it seems clear that we are set here within our own liking, at least till some future resolve is made where I am no longer needed; or, better said, when my place becomes contextualized by what I personally need and seek, then we may address ourselves and how we'll act then. It may be the case that we choose to move, or that our time here is still consistently spent and so we remain.
            <br>&emsp;One of the reasons for our stability here is that beyond the inherent access to food and work, the actual quality of living is strong. It is the winter after all and the cold has some drain, but no ambitions or demands are placed upon us. In the warmer months there is a possibility of suggestion, but we can least rest on being saddled into the opportunities offered by the land; or, moreso, to the means for fitness and its association with a generally free and hospitable home and environment. In short, the time that may ask us to move or 'grow up' will not be fostered by the necessity of 'improving our position'. When my parents no longer need me and my situation is personally staked, my choice can still be to make use of the free time as we have. In that case we may end up here till next winter. It is possible that after their initial travels that the question of work and 'our' future will be brought to question: but we can then surely move, or rest our contentment in making use of the time as we seek.
            <br>&emsp;This is an important point. To live in Vancouver requires that we work, or at least meet the requirements to hold room and bread. Doing so is not to my benefit though - when all is accounted for. I prefer to be free, fully; the main reason is that our values have more room to be self defined and targeted, as opposed to being concerned with their 'fortuned offering'. Herein will our truer interests have the room to establish themselves and expand, the result being a more significant reward because they were so unique and wholly made. If it comes to the summer and there is a question of a job, then I will go where that responsibility is fitting. If the request though is banked on my benefit and interest, then I will likely refrain. In all homes and land can I walk and travel, see and be pleased, study and write, stretch and train, watch and game, and think and plan in general, or assess. "All responsibility gives is one more time." If the need for this is barred by riches and splendor, then the duties will follow. My time is personally set when I have access to a consistent room and bread: and this is very easy to acquire. Moreso, if the hold of this is bound through privilege or patronage, then our use of it is effectively open -wherein there is no labor, only respect. In that case we can rest on the moments of peace, thinking about our life and what we want to do -and getting a similar grip on the situation and the free time that it provides.
            <br>&emsp;There are no stipulations for me living here. The openness does admittedly reveal the uncertainty we have without much trouble, but I think that this can be mended thoughtfully over time. Let us just take to be true that all is the same: the distinction is in the maker, of which we are sowing. We live in Kamloops; it has access to food and bed in good supply and quality; moreso is this offered to us through mutual respect. Indefinitely this will not remain nor will my interest likely forever stay; but in terms of what we are being asked to do and how that duration seems to suggest its longevity, does suggest that the situation we are in as it is will be in place for a great deal of time.
            <br>&emsp;What we are best to do is to assay the living in our lives. What draws you, what do you mean to work for and be; these are the questions that, if answered, will earn you some track and bearing, and therein composure amidst the wake of the world -especially when you are somewhere privileged or new. My limit though is that if I start somewhere, then the mold that I build around it that accounts for its place and called for action, will not likely include the scope of things that are equally deserving, through my interests, of similar treatment. And this is fair in its truth. A great deal of the objectives which I'm referring to are built out of ideal interests; or in other words, they were forged into something more actionable from a looser substance of inkling and whim. The issue is that their place despite being more full, is not within the sight of me. In fact nothing is, for we are not asked to name one. In some sense our prior development was born from the prominence of those whims being drawn out as a response to work and its necessity. Currently, the whole of the world bears the only demand of duty and obligation; for the stretch ahead the air is open and free for me to live and be. Respect is required though as the simplicity within the offer is only sustained by your congruence towards the family; in doing so we can expect food and a room, and all the land around our bed. Nothing more though. Forwardly thinking, we ought to gather ourselves into a more desiring position, wherein our aims are uncovered and clearly seen; therein we can establish them and outline a path for accomplishment. Right now though, I merely have the introductions of sight: our best is to get drawn to the scenery

            I moved out here on the 26th. From that Saturday it will be three weeks this coming weekend. That isn't that long admittedly. There are two mistakes I have made though. One is that I binged chocolate and chips on the third night as well as smoking twice. "Gosh did it make me irritable, short and tense." Following this I vowed never to have sugar, but choose to have pralines; these were admittedly satisfying and not severely bad, but the sugar was still terrible. Now, be it in states of proficiency or sufficiency, sugar and weed have no place, explicitly.
            <br>&emsp;Christmas is coming along with many meals and moments of cheer and pleasure; on that last note I amend not to eat chocolate or crap. World Cup is finishing this week, Dad is home next week, Avatar comes out and will be seen during Christmas; on the eve we will be having Piaea; Jess is coming on the day, leaving a few after with Mom and Dad. We are going to get some games and underwear hopefully along with a host of great books(of new or introduced editions) early next month. Hopefully by that time the peak of the cold will begin to subsist and we can get back into it being at worst cool; moreover, will the ability to more easily be outside paired with the dryness of the weather permit a cloud bonanza, 'from both the east and west'.
            <br>&emsp;I will mention training and food but there is a comment worth making first. In the colder months we are generally susceptible to poorer eating, smoking, a lack of training that follows, as well as more concerns about our place in life and a hesitance to look ahead with certainty (with the apprehension within rotation associated with that). The point though is that considering the lesser time outside and the increased difficulty in training, I would say that our choices should respect the fact that although what we wish for is good and that no amount of bad is amendable, we at least notice that our condition is harsher and narrower for us to be as resolute and simple as if it were summer or spring.
            <br>&emsp;Food and training in some shape or form come hand in hand. Starches and grain fill the bulk of our nourishment whilst dried fruit, some nuts and veg make for heart and sustenance. The strongest choices here are in having figs before bed instead of bread and grain along with keeping your starches to a later point during the day - which we will call the evening. Training wise there is strength and aerobic activity as well as the recovery and stability sessions. The latter is less than we would hope for and generally marks the limit for us being more composed and regular in our rigorous training and activity ahead. At the core of it there are forward folds, chaturanga, runners lunge, bridge and boat. Do these and everything else from strength and recovery will follow.
            <br>&emsp;A quick mention on our individual efforts earning us both a generous expression and receipt. The former refers to the value we bring within a transaction whilst the latter reflects that the 'customer' received the good on offer. This is important in our conception of aspiration and development. Before, we were a little muddled on the method or way of thinking about success and fulfillment; now, we can view it as truly being the greatest version of ourselves, wherein the contribution is rooted from the heave of our heart, but, in effect, is done so in such a grandly hilted way that the impression on offer is both substantial and rewarding for those seeing it. The point being that our generous interest and the associated stand which best houses the increased amount of attention and care, indicates a possible and or likely transaction and thus receipt.
            <br>&emsp;One thing to consider is whether or not our view of the world and the resolve we have moving through it, should be based on our individual situation or as if we were in a state of success. The former point suggests that our accomplishments are not guaranteed and are consequently based on aims, rather than expectations. The latter sentiment is more wide and loose; in its case, we may see the road more open and thus feel more suited for a broader amount of work and intention; the issue though is that things can be seen as necessary and possible based on the freedom that we supposedly have, and thus their promise and amendment are resolved because we can -compared to seeking so because it is our actual desire and aim. In our stiffer state, I'd measure the latter as being more prominent; in part the reason is that our relaxed nature would otherwise rest on our own interests as well as the frailty and indifference of the world; on the other hand, a restless and overly decisiveness nature rears itself when my grasp on promise and activities are shortened, along with the prominence of our ability to treat them -wherein our involvement would keep us present and seeing rightfully ahead from the current steps.
            <br>&emsp;I bring all this up because my clarity is being torn a little from a natural stiffness. This is in part due to ineffective choices that regard our lessened state upon eating sugar, traveling and its prior repercussions, as well as a minor setting of drugs. Our head is up though and my spirits are nothing short of high: though they are not many in optimism or vibrant stability. Rather they are somewhat unsettled, wrestling instead to say more and be more descriptive of the elements discerned through previous better days. Simply put the best thing for us to do is offer the most; it will draw us, further us and bring us the present of friendship and righteous plunder. It seems clear that our place in the world, be it in the smallest and most local of matters or in the reaches of grand glorious ways, is only approached and developed well when you produce an abundance of steps. Explicitly then, will this advance continue as much as those steps are regular and with consistent substance.
            <br>&emsp;I will rest on the principle of fortune and the irrelevance of position; respecting the fact that values increased are what drives us to feel like we are going through the greatest days, strongly implies that putting yourself forward in a way that brings you forward the most, will achieve the attraction of those around as well as rising to a generous point in which that comradery and welcomed tribute is of and for the foremost things -and the treatment of them that measures and marks the utmost claim. "Nothing has felt so far and round." The reason this is true is that from it I will proceed the most: with the merits of taking soundly steps being what makes this just, and thus a legitimate claim.

            We are underestimating the value of sitting and standing. Everyone will goe through ups and downs but upon the latter easier things must be understandably done. In this case, if rigour and eveness have left your chest and torso, then simply stand then sit. "you may find that in your thinner state, that doing so is mightily restorative; at thatt point then, you may reach a stabler and encouraging point where aerobic, strenght, power and restfull training can be done."
            <br>&emsp;CHristmas is here and I am all set to remain with myself. I have not pledged though to forgo the popcorn I initially set to have during Avatar. Perhaps I could compramise with one. The issue is that I had a hearty helping of packaged popcorn the other day. What I've noticed is that despite having worked our prior that this intake shattered all my strenght; it isnt drawing us into the ground like sugar, but I am definitely in a neutral state. As a consequence we went back to bed, with the blanket mind you, and I am now short of where Id like to be in composure and breath. Ive realized that things are never to little and that a lesson can be simply learned. "for the sake of writing, reading and studying along with proper strength, aerobic, power and restfull training, I will arrange myself with these in mind and refer to what they deem appropriate as the measured scale." To that, would the occasion of a three hour movie on christams warrant some popcorn, especially when treats, quiche, turkey and junk are not otherwise had. The Boom Chicka Pop was not appropriate, I admitt that. It's issue is it's own though and the consequences that we faith are not clearly as suscpetible when it comes to Movie Popcorn. The point being that even though we were drrained a bit, that our feeling was hurt more compared to the actuall future effect. In that, I mean to train now and tomorrow, followed by some aerobic work on the day of the movie. I understand how the steps infront of that will be surely hampered. "A issue to raise is that having rest for the day or two to follow because the prior days were for training, does not mean that doing nothing and eating poorly is appropriate." At least we are homest with ourselves; our decision then will be begrudgingly made, or seen as alright: the aim though which it is measured by earns us the most considerate respect.

        <div id="path">
            I see our efforts running us a great length of time. The better website will take a while to develop as will the Twitter and Linkedin projects, but for the most part they're taking the right steps. Infront with respect to where we're headed -as well as what we are looking to achieve- sees a good deal of unknown. I am familiar with what I wish to accomplish, but these aspects feel outside of my control. The notion goes that value is self determined and, in effect, alters the impressions and or experience of the outside world. "I use the example of valuing rigor and lightness in our work and how this bends our responsibilities towards this line, compared to being otherwise laborious. by virtue of being ignorant of what we seek -by no resolution, there is no adjustive bend."
            <br>&emsp;The word accomplishment reflects this strongly when it comes to our ultimate outcome; for one, if we reach a certain point or position, then it will be our values and aims that render the situation as personal to us. What I seek is to watch the sunrise and have a friend; to be precise, I am looking for regional flexibility and enhanced leisure through friendship. In terms of appropriation, it is clear that whatever fortune and freedom that we have upon success will not go towards bringing these interests out if they are not clear and cut as values or aims. "Consider this: you wish to drive a car for the thrills and excitement; you become rich and successful and are thus able to buy the car. On the flipside, your aim might have been to travel, of which your riches could then satisfy. If you acquire a good deal of wealth, but lack any aim, then you may spend it frivolously, and be then left with idle amounts of gold."
            <br>&emsp;True friendship and pastoral freedom are my purest aim. The reality though is that these reflect my state of indifference to the world and how I would be if it were the case. It is more likely that these interests can be broken down into particular activities that, however limited in comparison, represent the time you actually wish to spend within this liberated state. In that case, we might say that our interest in watching the sunrise is one of personal freedom; actively though, our active interest may be to travel around Vancouver for the sake of photography, or, moreover, is our baser interest in writing and deliberation similarly revealed. When it comes to these objective interests, then our direct initiatives and or present pursuits can tailor themselves as to bring this line out -that is, towards these objectives.
        </div>
        <div id="theroad">
            I am unsure of my overall aim. Filling up the sides have been those prior years of preparation and reason'd reverence, yet I do not know what it is for. This may illustrate the trouble I'm having. If you were in the desert you would see your life and decisions with respect to the heat and the sand; if you were with a group of people, you may be more clear and open to the workings of a team as well as the presence of people as a whole. I feel that since we are on our own though, our ambition is set within that respect. This is not to say that we are doing something wrong. It may be the case that working with others can dilute your own interests and purpose, but you would still have some no less, merely together. The reality I find though is that most people are not so keen to be deliberate and objective; rather, the bulk of the common effort is along a focused path that will yield more fortuned rewards. I myself however am looking for the ways and reasons to actually live well. I proudly confess that any sort of arrangement and address that reflects that is fine and dandy to me. I can accept that a partnership, or a team, requires a mixing of whole, of which no particular member is in control of any key emphasis. Despite being fine though, there are seldom any suitors that mean to exist(however uniquely) on that side of living. "A company for profit is quite easy to join or found, but one of interest and wholesome reward, that is hard to take part in outside private effort. But therein I lie."
            <br>&emsp;The workings here aside, I can say that the issue in my life within these regards, is that I know very little who have such passions in a substantial way. Most people are actively ambitious or not so, but their direction is in improving their position; the simpler of the two merely accepts what they have and makes the best use of it, though it is in a satiating way; the more ambitious side, looks to improve what they have and thus bars down along the path that offers this: it is similar though, for the position's sake. We on the other hand are more concerned with how we are going to live. The trouble though is I am not sure exactly how and where that could be. One point is worth noting that reflects our similar desire to advance, but for what kind of living the position allows. This is at the heart of our foolish desire, as it suggests that there are things that can be done in one position and not within the case your in right now. This has some merit, but on the whole it does not stand. On one hand, there is the notion of friction and how your active time can be easily spent; our ambition then may be to remove the shackles so we may be more openly and simply artistic; this is in some ways a sound choice, but merely a reflection along the common path: beneath this there is either some or none of the grounding definition of what it is you wish to do, and thus the grip onto it that would naturally follow. Effectively, if we use the time that we have to clarify our interest -regardless of our toil- then the aims we have will at least be laid out and make clear how they are promising. Therein, if we are troubled to be a certain way, we can at least know what it is we are being held back from: in contrast to knowing little in this case, would the aspiration to go somewhere where the efforts were more clearly firm and heavy be unjust and reflective of your poor thinking now.
            <br>&emsp;We are making something from nothing, as I say, and this does not suggest that others will immediately see, or likely be in the same position. We are most fortunate to have grown up in a world that was open for all yet set for little; therein, no harm that I incurred left me with any deep misfortune; rather, it was only a lack of clarity that unfolded along my way, and thus my response was to embellish more focus and objectivity. Doing so in this free and modern age, means that those interests that I discerned to have, could be molded and staked on the impression that they were both viable and achievable. Greatly then, I am then trying to figure out what it is I would like to accomplish; because even though I have made great use of this open lane for a change of and resolve through my newly founded interests, the world and the people in its whole are still generally set in seeking more from it, rather than themselves. "And in that it is hard to find the rewards and promise of a friend."
        </div>
        <div id="ubiquity">
            Even though our future is ill defined, our past has a fine bearing and present grip. For example, we know where we have come from and what we have so far achieved; it is simply the case that these things are perhaps in need of some of their own refinement, following through to a more substantial deliberation onto what lies ahead. We are resting too far from the proper place of assessing where we are. We live on earth and that is not going to change. Even if SpaceX is able to send someone to Mars in the next ten years, it will be another ten before a minor colony is set up, and likely 15 before there is a tangible settlement. For people like us who are common to our own planet, this is all we got. Moreover, are national lines drawn in a way that only those of a traveling or merchant class can significantly surpass. Seeing the Yangtze or the woods of Bengal does have this aesthetic appeal, but it is only within my leisurely dreams; furthermore then, when we assume the kind of people who will be able to see these, we must also assume that their place is one of busy mobility: wherein the streets of Delhi or the fields of Mozambique are passed by while occupied. Compare this to the local living of every single person in their present home, and you can see that besides the dreams we have of being able to move around, no place is that special. Or, better said, that vision we have is only with respect to traveling around; and this would be nice, but is only accessible to those with the assets to do so. I would not limit the interest of these within that class of folk, rather I would suggest that the brevity of their positions grants comparably little time for such pleasantries and aesthetic interest. In other words, those able to travel are as such from their agenda to go places and further their position; that they would relish the grasslands of the Great Steppe or the violent blue of the East China Sea, is not so likely: and if so, then that scenario we will conclude as just.
            <br>&emsp;Its many intricacies though must be further explained, as the brief view of it is that our heartfelt dreams are not in their case compatible or desired. The point I am trying to make reflects that notion of becoming wise after a conquering; determining the value of this is troubling as the inquiry is burdened by syllogisms and dialectics -if this then that they say, or, if so, then no wonder this is worth addressing(and so on). The reason perhaps is that we are too incomplete in our own definition and thus need to offer consideration for an opposing side -as to remove our own assumptions. The sentiment is a struggling one for it marks the breadth of our time and effort upon all other things; the regard though of what one ought to do in this world (as we have explained to be our explicit place) is simply a leading requirement -for the rest of our intentions and interests are valued from and based off this. I believe the remedy is within the removal of a logical error one makes in the claim 'if I could then I should, for why would I otherwise not'. The notion goes that, money for example is not to be taken, within reason, as the highest value and aim. Even the lowliest of us could at least administer a claim on this as being true, regardless of their (or anyone's) resolve or action to it. But, as our first premise, would acquiring some not be so bad; in fact, on a similar basis of what seems obvious, would it be acceptable and preferred. We are living creatures after all and within our current state of the world, money reflects the means for obtaining what it is that we need. Again, we could at least within reason admit this is feasible. The other side of this though is with regards to how money is really acquired. Would you live forever if you could, well sure: but who is yielding you this? And, if so, would your resolve not be in line of doing what is good from this fortune? Moreso then, could we not simply say that the right thing is what brings all paths into their respectively proper way? Therein, if the highest of fortunes still ask that we use them well, then would any other situation not require of us the same?"
            <br>&emsp;This is a strong philosophy and can serve as an uprooting principle: we are trying to step back from the front though, away from assumptions I might add. To illustrate where the confusion lies, we could draw the point that being able to work towards acquiring money is seemingly more profitable than be unable and with lacking. The question then is should this be our ambition, in acquiring money that is? Well at this point we could reflect on the value of such achievement and concern ourselves with the nature of its real offer, and thus see whether anything is really accomplished. In doing so, we could reasonably say that our status and fortune would improve, and that our place having grown alongside this progression would see us similarly matured; perhaps not though, as our attention may have been elsewhere, or set otherwise beyond the proper use of those former gains.
            <br>&emsp;What one should do is simply difficult to suggest or defend. For one thing, without a reason why a particular effort should be desired, then our baser and innate interests have no real competition or means of prevention. The idea though is that due to our more thought out and considerate thinking about the world and its offer, we are implicity sided with all that which is above those primitive grounds. The difference is that one needs little justification for its ground and is purely based on what the agent impulsively seeks; the contrasting role though is in need of stronger reasoning and assessment as that is what it is set on doing. I am losing track though. All that matters is what we are right to do. What is best then is that which is honed to and in accordance with that. The casing however is tricky for we end up within a dialectic. I'll let it go and see if some sleep and activity can spurr some clearer thoughts into my mind. As it stands, to reiterate, there is a field of uncertainty and our partial acquaintance through it; shouldering this is strict knowledge of our scenario: our goal then is in furthering that line so that the material inside has a more firm and in depth shell: for we can then proceed without certainty yet well.

        <div id="ledger">
            My past writings are in need of some proper arrangement -with the aim of sharpening them up for display. The portions set for this portrayal are those of typing -even though I have written a lot elsewhere. This began in the spring of 2020. At this time I was coping with the troubles of women and responsibility foremost, though, some measure of leisure and joy was still being reinforced. These truly were the roots of my prominence, 'and I owe my trunk and its treats from the preliminary works of that'. As it stands there are about 5 or 6 pages of several paragraphs each; most are within a speculative and value forming state. However, there is some brief mention of specifics, within the heart of it at least; actually, on one page's account there is a strict list of brief statements that are more particular and clear. In any case, these are our roots and worth mentioning thus within our aim of refurbishment and portrayal.
            <br>&emsp;Following this period I was quite indifferent in my life; my choices were inconsistent and my aims were few; consequently, conflict arose and my bearings wained. In effect my considerations became more fundamental, falling substantially onto the floor of Theology. In the latter year this sentiment was carried forth in subsequent sets of work and production. I learned CSS and HTML, building a web page that would continue to host my efforts for the year that has till this point come. The first batch of works was a group of writings called 'On Things'. The aim of these was to establish some sort of footing by means of inquiry within core concepts. The pieces were as follows: On Gods, On Parenting, On Things, Of Residency, On Rome, The Method, On Validity, Of Cosmology, The World and, lastly, a Nature of Numbers. These are each worthy of a sharpened treatment like those earlier reflections. A key note of distinction is that these pieces contain way more subjection to actual elements of the world, whereas those personal inquiries were almost purely set within establishing a scale to judge; in that case, as will be similar for the efforts ahead, is their some worth in going over these works and treating them tributively -or giving our thoughts on the matter, a report if you will. For example, in the case of On Gods, there may be sentiments of pantheism or the nature of deities that is worth elaborating on.
            <br>&emsp;The batch of writing that follows is comparable, though I'd say it is of a more tailored kind. The group could be broken up into 2 categories, one being historical treatment(as there are so many) and one of solid reflection and creation. To the latter this includes works inspired from Elden Ring and Civ as well as a good amount of heartfelt description; on the other end of this are pieces which reflect insights of our heart, or at least further clarities onto more practical matters. Hallmarking these are three key essays: On Norms, On Monogamy and On Careers. These encapsulate the reach of my thinking at the time and provide a good measure of our heartfelt direction -as well as being the furthest that our writing(at the time) could reach. The former section is much easier to describe in comparison. It includes the following: On Greece and On Protestantism, Medieval Philosophy, The Middle Ages and The Renaissance. Some of these have been given a formative treatment despite having room to still improve; nevertheless, they are all well produced from the ground up and a strong contributor to the group -which we have called Winter Writings. Moreover, do these latter historical writings reflect the extent to which I could write, whereas that prior one is more reminiscent fo our ability to think and inquire.
            <br>&emsp;This time was a good one. We were void of drugs(as we have continued to be) and our direction in life had both consistent success and enjoyment. Later in the spring we moved to Vancouver. At this time we developed a journal that would hold the bulk of our future writings in a larger way. At first, I wrote about the land and our place as one in the midst of present fortunes. As time went on I furthered my sketchings onto sentiments of maturity, being alright with death, being thoughtful in our judgments and furthering our home within consistent inquiry. Later that summer we got a job at Superstore and a great deal of my strenuous time(in regards to writing) became centered on solidifying our time spent within the role, as well as strengthening or reasons for adherence. Within this stage we advanced the notions of natural tendency and congruence to our congenial actions; foremost though was the principle of our limit, wherein our need to explain everything was simply unnecessary due to the fact that in whichever state we reached, our action would still follow. This point in our recent lives bent us towards a resolve and thinking based on a first principle. Following this period into the early fall I developed a Diary. The aim of this was to make room for more sparse and unwhole messages; initially, I used it in this way but furthered my additions into more substantial topics. Notably, I made several large pieces on our familial and developmental history; as well, did I advance our interest and hold within communal ambition -rooted in the network state and development of a community. The subsequent stage of which I am generally still in, worked its way through more firm and objective treatments of the world and its elements, along with outlining a considerate view of justice and the law. "Building on this I have cultivated a fully rounded stake within living properly and well." Alongside this, there has been a warm and welcomed response to our place in life and its just interest of solidifying the terms for candidates to become subject for generous treatment, sound judgment and well founded inspection. This writing that we have summarized marks the origin of our coming set of projects. Shouldering this are lectures on reason and theology, cosmology and the history of earth -as well as the recorded history of man. In terms of tribute, there are a host of films and shows that draw me to treat them in their own unique and respective ways; in addition, there are universes within movies and games(i.e canons) which upon fortune would offer me the time and ability to create worlds and experiences, with the aim of treating them with admiration and care - on my own, this bends towards screenshots and mere canonical definition, rather than group oriented work(of which I'd be so fortuned). On the edge of our capacity and time is the host of literary subjects ripe for inquiry and derivation; as well are the greats and their own biographical treatment. Alongside these more constructive efforts are those with more relevance to me personally. On one side are a series of principles and prospects that illustrate our view and resolve of the future and its most suitable intention; as well are reflections of our past and inscribing of our own personal history. In addition is there a project that marks the world and nature as it is with respect to me. The aim of this is to give me more constance and appreciation through better seeing what we have as well as better displaying what there is that is freely ripe and accessible for fruitful taste, treatment and profit.
            <br>&emsp;To reiterate, the trunk of this stems from that root within writing. These efforts that I have explained build on top of this as formative and heartfelt interests. If these are what shoulder the torso of writing, then our fuller projects mark the head of our life. Foremost is our work within implicit operations -better known as the Theory of Value- and its illustration through Sums. Secondly is our treatment of Middle Earth and Lord of the Rings into a more steadily and evenly made tale that emphasizes the richness and wholesome joy found through Tolkien's original telling of the story and world. Lastly perhaps is Soundtracker; this merely explains our interest in musical scores and the goal of arranging them for a simple and improved experience, along with giving room to contribute our own creative additions -such as music vids or gentle treatments. Those three stand out to me as being the most grand and present.
            <br>&emsp;Our objective is to create a website bolted in the brand of Ryan Michael Green. Here, my aim is to portray each of these works and pieces along with giving a mark for other platforms to branch towards. In that case, a Twitter anthology will mark our strongest public effort; as well, will Medium, Linkedin and any other suitable sites to illustrate and promptly display our writing be significantly worthwhile. And that feels like the proper extent of our efforts and their formation into both creations and fitted interests. Simply, we are going to do our best and wish for nothing more: for we are grateful enough to be eligble towards and active within this lasting state of flourishing generosity, deliberation, kindness, treatment and care. All of which we will drill into the ground to show, not for more resources, but to plant our name in and allow it to give its strongest and truest expression. "That is, and will be, our righteous good and gold."
        </div>

        <div id="primary">
            I think that our most truthful and core being is unlimited when it comes to application and resolve. As I like to say, if we were in a dungeon we could reflect on the fact that our time is still set for the same as those as Kings; moreover, could I repent for the injustice that I had produced, or be grateful for what I still had and who I was if the injustice was served to me. This is a baseline for me personally.
            <br>&emsp;In the middle somewhere is someone who has a little place to live, the basics of food and leisure, and the sparse amount of work to simply fit this line, but nothing more. At that point there is no injustice, merely poor choices that prevented my prior actions to make better use of this freer time, or the unluck that no such opportunity drew me to make that way. "We are still by our own choosing and trajectory."
            <br>&emsp;As an ointment then would I say that if the growth you seek is hampered in a certain way, that you relish how much is already here by your very presence in and amongst the air. The clouds offer a mix of colors and size, the sky similarly; the moon, sun and stars spin forever on, even in the winter and its chilling cold. No matter the day there is something promising, even if we cannot at the moment see it. Then, there is all that we can do. There is no war in this country or most like it; even then, are those that do have conflicts not subject to their wares at every space in time. We are free and this entails we have a baseline of consideration and care. Furthermore, would I remove the need for vanity, for even though these more open tides allow us to correspondingly achieve, it is wrong when it comes to either of two ways: one is that the improvements we seek are unnecessary to achieve more freedom than we already have, and two, that in whichever state that we're in, can the bulk of our treatment be comparable and raised. On this latter I mean that our interest on the whole is to throw ourselves into what we see; this is why work is so gruesome as it is done so with reluctance and friction; moreso, can you admittedly remove such roughness through being grateful and becoming more adjusted; but as a point of prominence within a vessel of care, these things are simply not so: they are at best, responsibilities and demands in which we make more soothing and amiable, but never flourished with glee. Still, the leaves on the tree and the fruit from the buds need some bark to grow on, and as a whole one could not employ themselves into a gracious space that was paired with being rational, and not respect and equally indulge in the fact that these goods we have and seek, are born from and in requirement of the means that brought them here, and our similar adherence.
            <br>&emsp;The heart of this though are those sweeter kinds of a reward. Compared to the security and fullness that you get from doing your duties well, those things which draw your creativity and lightness of touch provide more means of trust and rigor into your heart -whereas the latter gives more stretch to your bones, and settles them in. The effort that we truly seek are those ones in which we offer ourselves for the sake of contribution. In the case of our tasks and roles, we are simply trying to finish something. Our treatment of the world, in contrast, can never blossom enough and rewards us for ever doing so. I would illustrate our painting of this portrait in that we are satisfied in drawing the curves and shades of our line, but equally are we pleased in seeing the figure come together as a whole. On one hand, it might strictly be nice to look at, or draw you to feel a ceratin way by its gravity and strength. As the makers though there is something for us, or at the very least who know enough to be able to see the innermost and connecting parts. In that case, it is the stance of one familiar enough to find an appreciation, that such individual things could come together into this whole, and set itself apart as a complete form through and by these particular lines and pieces. It is as if we can see the delicacy and touch that went into shaping and setting each color, shade and line. In other words, our abled eye can set back with a gaze that sees the whole for its entirety; but sifting through the sides are all the edges and places that bring all this together to form such union, whereby our delight and fulfillment is kindly pressed onto the time spent and seemingly produced into a unique portion. Therein, is it that small piece that makes it more than just a whole, for we see it only with our own gracious claim as a thing that is marbling our baser impression of the whole.
            <br>&emsp;The world thus, as I see it, is already smoldered and claimed when it comes to our viable treatment. Therefore do I suggest that we extract ourselves out of misery and dissent, and place our attention instead onto the priority setting of reverence, treatment, honor and care. "Doing so onto the workings of and development into the righteousness and revivity of either right or countering wrong, will give us an invincible claim, of which no dungeon or hell could protrude."

        <div id="1842">
            The classic question in regards to creativity: whether your limits are in ability or within the possibility of leveraging it? In most ways for each, you could say more but this is simply effective. It should be noted that these concerns are best addressed as if one were asking advice; the question may be "what would you do in this day and age considering the following statements: I have a great deal of skill and products to show it, where should I go to bring them into the spotlight," or, "I wish to be creative and successful, but I am unsure if the former can even be met before any impression is profitably made." Personally, I would remove any concern for the second point; this is due to the fact that our original and generous efforts are enough for value to be made; in other words, the sharpness of our lines or productions that reflect the grandest and most popular aspects that you otherwise see during your days, is not the condition in which we must stake ourselves on -just in order to be in the arena. In that case, we will assume that we have value to bring; moreover, as we address the second point of its placement into the world, we can infer that as we come along to achieving that, our generative and or tributive efforts will follow with increases and certainty.
            <br>&emsp;Let's throw ourselves into the water a little. Pretend it's 1842 and you have equal interests of the present, only in those older days: what do you do? Well, the very limits of being able to cooperate and present would bend both our expectations and suitable resolve into ones that were very driven and initiated. Better said, if the means for you to be known is blocked by the very ability for anything to be simply seen at all, then the work required to do so naturally draws one who is interested to rigourously oblige. In our modern times we confuse this. We look at the vastness of social media and ease by which 'self publishing' can be achieved; for most of us though we are both short in making use of what that freedom truly offers, but similarly narrow in what we think is worthwhile to share. "It's as if someone said anyone can be known 'so start producing!'. Your oblige may be to throw yourself into the medium that is openly offered to you, emphasizing though the hanging fruit of it all instead of leveraging it to express more genuinely and thoroughly built creations."
            <br>&emsp;Going back, we can be clear that the aim of those in those lesser days are no more valid or less worthwhile than they are in these times of ability and fortune. The key difference is that being in the open requires a more humbled approach to your creativity. I would draw the example like this. If nothing is likely to be achieved for the medium is so closed off, then what you have to bring is not really that important. This is because the quality is not going to remove the nature of the restrictions, nor will the hustle and bustle to break through them or likely emphasize effort beyond that which gets you over the hurdles and past the fray. Our point rests on emergence then. This amounts to taking steps forward wherein progress is ultimately made; in effect, wrong steps will be made apparent and prompt calibration, as will good steps be noticed and reinforced. That is why in some ways those harsher times are more beneficial as the work itself bears little resistance and, thus, those who can push through the friction of their expression will naturally have something original to share upon breaking through to the other side. The present though sees us immediately able to step in and be seen, or at least it appears so initially. The demand though is that if the means to expression is so small, then we must pay attention to what we have to say. This rests on the notion that those with something genuine to share are the ones who wish to share it the most; therein will those in olden times who broke through the resistance have an accumulated set of creative efforts that had trailed behind their forward discipline. Without the need for that discipline though now, there is no stretch of time for our creations to progress and develop; instead, we jump in and offer the simplest thing. "I just don't see how this is worthwhile in a lasting sense: as if sharing something which you are doing so for the sake of sharing will stick around forever."
            <br>&emsp;Instead, we should use the free time we have to address the actual work or interests we have to share. Again, to reiterate that the aims of the past are equal to the present; the point from before is that through the previous difficulties of expression that the perseverance required to push through it would be accompanied with genuine work that, upon breaking through, is then able and worthwhile to be shared; this contrasts our present scenario wherein our head cant be down with the work developing behind us; in our case the work is here and ready to be shared. The principle though regarding aims is that living is achieved where it is done so the most. Those of the past who succeeded ended up having something worthwhile to share; in our case though the immediate offer is to share brief pictures, comments and gifs. This is fun by the sake of expression: it is not lasting or substantial though. Perhaps because it is not in any way significant; rather it is just a passive and or small jabble, a pastime if you will. Through the interest to be furthered in our living, we can address that aim as achieved when something warrantable of bringing forth and thus generating a great deal of expression is made, will hone us forth as a target, bearing itself from the root of our concern regarding what it is we have the most to say.
            <br>&emsp;The distinction, in closing, is that doing something abundant is what measures the goal of living. Currently, the openness does not effectively promote the achievement of this for the draw of it is too quick and immediate; and, again to reiterate, that those in the past had no such fortunes and thus had to take more time to be in the spotlight; consequently though, their efforts had more time to develop. In this day then we must simply assess what abundance we will create. Upon doing so we can administer it through the platforms and earn an amount of living equal to the greatness of our generous and formative time. That is to my knowledge all encompassing and complete.
        </div>
        <div id="ourbest">
            My writing is the best step I can take. For one, if I did it to the best of my ability, there would be no other thing which reflected better of me. Initially, this will allow for union between me and my parents along with any possible nearby friends. The hope is that if you have an accessible reference(or platform rather) then you can more successfully show what you got; consequently, we can achieve a better understanding and therein openness, or even draw someone in. This marks the natural way of our line wherein someone local to us becomes affiliated with our sort of effort. Following this, the extent of that locale increase, wherein those suitable for collaboration and friendship is more regional. This represents the aim at least.
            <br>&emsp;At the core we are writers and thinkers, the inner treatment of which reflects the effort within a personal standing. Outwardly though is their advantages in what you can locally show, as well as being able to present the works through openly accessible and appropriate platforms(such as Medium, LinkedIn or Twitter). This generally brings us out more and towards two comparable ends. For one, if being more outward and public draws you to be more sharp and accountable, then your investment in the work and care for it is increased: this marks the kind of metric that we want our steps to abide by. Secondly refers to this notion 'that putting yourself out into a medium which is highly active and elaborate is opportune for possible and quirky results. We don't know who could see or to what extent; the profit in that is a mix between the sharpness we enact under these expectations, the chance for separate work and opportunities, or the local wish and desire to find and work with a friend. That is an optimistic yet realistic view of our digital contributions.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, the question for those with this aim in mind, is what can they generously do the best? The repercussions which we are banking on is the plausibility that both our opportunities, fortunes and base foundation will improve; moreso, can we say that however ill fit we are to the line, that the path and bearing that it is on is one that will almost explicitly last forever. In that case we can be sure that the promise we see now will only concentrate in the likely prospects as well as what you would later expect to come. This, at least, is the mature and reverent case for consistency through the steps that one can take best: and doing so well bears the most favour when the content within the progress is reminiscent of the goal to subsequently proceed.
            <br>&emsp;Within this garment there are three stitches I can see. At the base sits our current writings and the arrangement that we mean to make of them; these have been collected for two years now, building off eachother; they need some sharpening and the usefully proper display to encourage this; moreso, are they set to be the things(in collections) that get put out there: as the tributive offerings from me. Now that I've mentioned this I can see that this is the primary line. The second thread is of our worldly conquest(in study that is) and the third of our project of implicit operations and Sums. These, for now, like our treatment of nature and insight into the many worlds of interest to me, will cultivate themselves privately. Worth noting, is that key former is set to do so with formative aims, whilst the latter two are for my own gains and enjoyment. Literature, in addition, will be added to Lectures and Sums -the emphasis being on its industrious expression and formation.
        </div>
        <div id="concessions">
            On the private end our aim is in establishing the pitch for further objectives ahead. Better said, for example, if our personal goal is in learning and teaching the foundations and inquiries of cosmology(etc.) then solidifying and arranging the terms and topics is how our cultivated and designing efforts are best to be. On the other hand is our literal effort of portraying the writing we have so far done. "It is the hardest thing you see, but I am fine and able to do it; that is the fact that being well off and true is generally a solo problem and pursuit; bringing it out then feels and seems both unsuitable and poorly received." Nevertheless, I see much hope and familiarity within our wish to proceed down this path. For one there is no short amount of admirable and useful insight, be it from books, people or ideas. Wrapping myself in and around these allows for the words and principles that I am seeped in to have a more appropriate and prominent display. This is because my wish to step forth is not aimed at acquiring the means of separate conquest given by impressions, profit and response; instead, I am only trying to live more. There is an opportunity to do so whilst we smoothen our need for responsibility. "The printing press has just been invented; some look at this and think 'wow, what an opportunity! we can make books now, valued ones due to this new machine, and therefore sell them for money(and a good amount at that)."They're all so excited to earn something in which the rewards could go towards somewhere else they wish to proceed. My feeling though is that whether the tool of use for your artistry and enjoyment is of a brush, a method of binding, a means for stitching or simply thinking clearer and well, that doing so richly and freely is what best marks the final line in which your heart dreams of proceeding.
            <br>&emsp;My point, is that however much there is to gain from putting my best foot forth, that no amount of progress and corresponding profit that's gained will rightfully suggest or permit that you stop. Put another way, my concern is foremost onto what I wish to and mean to do in the most wholesome and full sought way; this contrasts those intentions that are admittedly desired, but conceited to the possibility of developing advantages or fulfilling separate ambitions. "As they say, there is a right way to acquire wrong things; there is also a right way to approach experiencing the right things. And my single difficulty is in confidently and substantially saying what thing I wish to properly do."
            <br>&emsp;There is some thing I seek. Its range carries the rot within our bottom, wherein we wish for and expect grandiosity and excitement, to the top and its own active stake. There is no need to deny it; being honest instead will ultimately show you the way with respect to the natural and or rugged interiors which shoulder your way. If I were a child in an impoverished country there would be little that could be done to change that; my desires though, if they are well formed and rooted, will reflect your interests and needs within the given situation. Our spirits may be high wherein we see grand horizons and possibilities afar, or we may be ill tempered and wishing to simply leave the place were in. In neither case though is there any real composed and well standing result that was founded through a similar way. "Its as if we wish for things outside of our control, or otherwise have too much confidence that our own abilities will be able to surmount the requirements; we simply spend too much time dreaming and not enough time asking ourselves who we are and what we seek in our life right now."
            <br>&emsp;In my own case I have spent a great deal of time removing the false assumption that other people, places and things are centrally different, so that I may rest easier in place with the knowledge that each and all(and thus here) is the same. I've cleared this path for me, yet I still find myself strung along and restlessly enticed by the possibilities of adventure, glory, infamy and deliverance. I don't mean to do this; but I cannot strictly tell you why it is I mean to do what I currently am, or otherwise rather. The insight thats most useful here, is within our limits due to conceiting to making concessions, and allowances for indecent considerations. The point of the earlier notion was that your hopes and ambitions are sound and just when you respect the relevant mold; this accounts for your observations, intuition(for profit and adjustment), as well as self importance and steering desire. These are all what amount to me and are thus the elements and therein mold, which houses the foremost string of my aims and interests. Instead of removing responsibility from the picture and over emphasising the need 'to live well', we should do more when it comes to settling in and ordaining ourselves to more suitable ambitions -ones that better reflect our place and detainment. In that, we can iron out the edges that are present whilst strengthening those that are appropriate for improvement. In that way will our place sort itself into a more soothing and fertile lane, whereby our tuned following of it will bring us solidly to the ends that mark an aim born from the best within our present position.
        </div>

        <div id="showingup">
            For most of my life I have been patient with success. I knew for a great deal of time that it would naturally come, and my only place was to adhere to the tracks of the line; or, better said, that life would continue on, going forever with or without me: and my task was to keep up. As I have grown, that end for me has changed. Whereas before there was some image of deliverance and exploration, I see more personal studies of literature, and practice of stability and strength through the body -for both a means and pleasure itself. As well, do I look forward to games arriving, whilst I play the ones I have regularly enjoyed; in addition, are my love of movies and shows, along with personalities and peers. On top of this is a level of gregarity, in which I share what I have where I can, and in a way that reflects both the creativity and ability simply found in me. To that the world has become more immediate and round.
            <br>&emsp;For some reason though the thought of having some popcorn, or sitting in a theatre(and watching a whole movie in general), or staying up late seems to provide me with an underlying despair. Comparably, though different in that it seems reasonable to me, are the uses of sugar, for its draining effects, smoking weed, for its shortness of expectations and respect, as well, as of recent, the use of a blanket, wherein I choose to sleep without for the claim of a stronger rest. These latter have become, or are at least becoming more firm as important things for me to avoid. Those former though have no rational effect. "The scale of our principal wains." Part of me thinks that there is a reason for these concerns, but the other side of me says that they are addressing issues that aren't really notable. What I mean is that perfection and purity go along way towards being productive; however, if your image of what those efforts should be are stretched out and apprehensively placed, then the need for and strain onto excellence will prompt itself with haste. "It is that rush to be so that tolerates nothing short of the reverent step towards prudent consistency."
            <br>&emsp;And there are principles based at the heart of these concerns that are worth addressing. Our activity is best when it is appropriate for the day in time; too much have our stronger years seen us premature in our routine of training, wherein we'd be better off letting ourselves be more lightly active through the middling days as opposed to the rushed pursuit of rigor and strength. This is a useful insight. Despite that, my feeling is that the key lesson of the story is not to have sugar due to its debilitating effects when it comes to this scenario; paying attention to your state even if it is well is preferable, but to suggest that perfection is required is not explicitly required for favorable results to occur. In that, would I say that there is no rush to bring out our time. In fact, by edging ourselves to grown up rewards from paying attention, our actions will naturally and subsequently become more conducive to those more reasonable and heartfelt desires. Perhaps it has just not come together in a way that I can fully see.
            <br>&emsp;For me, Adulthood is coming whilst our childish years trail behind. To that, I see our death, yet all of our life beforehand treated to and sown together in what I wish to accomplish and receive, as well as what I hone myself in on and fortifty myself against -for I know what to generally expect. In that case, would the natural misfortunes and troubles of work and despair be worth our preparation and regard; moreso then, and to this I feel is what truly makes me a man, is I know both what I want to do and be, and, moreover, have I begun and moreso been developing the reverence, to appreciate that there is goodness in these steps ahead, to which the demand of me is placed on showing up with ablility and gratitude. To that, I say, that where we're going, whether unsure or known, is one where each step is one that I can both grasp and take; consequently, at the present place I'm now, am I confident and breathing, for I know by this fate and resolve that I will forever proceed.
        </div>
        <div id="whole">
            I think as a rule of thumb, that it would be helpful to state what you currently know. Herein, you can at least progress towards clarity of the fray with a better grasp of the knowledge you already have. Moreso, to note, should we reflect on the fact that our situation here within a limit suggests that our reverence for one kind of knowledge or the other is wrong, unless it sits inside the speculative model. Therein, would only the things that we can until this point profess bear any merit: for otherwise we have mistaken truth for things not yet inside reason’s domain.
            <br>&emsp;Foremost among these is the fact that when we die, there will be peace and tranquility. I know this because there is nothing besides this that fits the description. Admittedly, I am attributing my own position on the kindness of nothing. But we can at least say that we are surely headed for the latter, which I see no error in attributing the gain of serenity, as one would in their deepest and darkest sleep. “Where, if you awoke, there would not be much more than the fadedness of old memories and the ease of going back in.” Therefore, to be frank, there is quite little to fear in regards to our absolute gain. I mean not to say that our lineage of associative reverence bears nothing in terms of value or address, but we must consider that the bulk of it is wrong . “Or at any rate, its value is based on there being no sound alternative (or favorable on at that).”
            <br>&emsp;In addition, I would add that this is not because we have expanded our knowledge of what constitutes the law -or nature of things. In olden times we knew so little; moreover, were the most impressionable things were those of a disastrous nature. Thereby our impression of the world came from squeezing calamity through an unmitigated lens. The advances of modern science and physics however, merely show what is more accurately coming through the funnel.
            <div class="qu">Only thought though -regarding these sound findings- and our resolve into the frontiers of justice can bear us any closure and stake into what we should either refine or further look at, and therein what we could hope to achieve -and are right to otherwise expect</div>
            I would propose then that our stance moving forward be positioned with respect to two things. One, is that we should abide by the natural principle and remove ourselves from being so subject to things which are not stable or properly founded. “Doing so will remove any unneceesary friction from clarifying and amending to the otherwise (natural) truth).” Second, is that our possession of a more complete register, or accurate base of knowledge rather, is not either A) a sufficient demonstration of what it is we ought to do -as we have not thought about what these new facts mean, but merely gathered them- and B) a warrant for ever removing the needed inquiry regarding what those things should receive in terms of our treatment -as new evidence will likely be found, nor our thinking completed, or without room to grow that is.
            <div class="qu">Neither of these aspects have any merit in being one-sided. In both of their cases, the points that they have are merely reminiscent of a lack of judgement, as well as a boldness ‘that is too quick to at last claim a meaning of all’</div>
            Put another way, the law is reflected in the scope of things; to be more precise, the law in our case is that which nature wishes for us to do, to which our obligation would be justice. We mustn’t mistake the fullness of our investigation as an end to what we have to do, for despite the accuracy and breadth of the illustration, we will have still yet considered what it is we have to do. Or at any rate, what we see, how we feel, whether there is in fact more to say, or at least discover. “In other words, that regard for attesting to our treatment must be advanced through discursiveness, rather than planting our feet at the apprehension of being without a certain cause, or thinking even that upon knowing what said cause is, that our judgements (and according resolutions) are done.”
            <div class="qu">Science may bring us all, but are we not men who’d then use it?</div>
        </div>
        <div id="trust">
            We will die and that’s ok. Foremost, is this the case for the appreciation we have in the temporary side of living that constitutes the flip side of the story. Hereby, we’ll revere the fact that this gift of joy and activity was given; moreso, we’ll simply refer to this time as the living state of our being, upon which end we will enter a state of rest. “To peace then we will expect.”
            <br>&emsp;As for what we should do prior, this grounds itself through resolutions born from thoughtfulness. Let us say that mortality and its pleasing condition bears offers to how we should approach it. In that way, those efforts we consider will have an indifferent end by which they make, wherein the hope for such activities require nothing more than reaching that place through our strongest step; this occurs when the regard for where they are headed is not ill arranged, or banked outside the activity itself -and its actual claim of living. In other words, if we are living well, then this will be accountable by virtue of us being steadfast and clear onto our anticipated end. This is opposed to wishing for something other -which is in fact untrue- and placing our efforts towards there. Instead, we should bend ourselves to the proper mold depicted by the prior sentiment. “Which is that our end is coming, necessarily, but of rest and ease is all it will be: where we thus happily comply, in living to then with peace and ”
            <br>&emsp;Specifically though, since our time is not right outside of proper living, then we ought to propose what those appropriate actions are. For one, we don’t fully know. This is perhaps because our resolve to meet death peacefully is one based on a valid assumption. Despite our confidence, the end may not be as we take it, and the possibility for mistaking that renders our fundamental resolve at the most likely. Seeing as our actions have no strict measure, we can still uphold the reasonable bound within that wholesome limit. In that case, our interests pull the bill; moreso, does our formative treatment of them mark the height in which their attention can treat. However, it is worth noting that these inclinations that one may have -which in some way is what we are talking about- are really our innate tendencies and desires convening with candidates for relations. For example, we are able to see for the sake of vision and its utility within survival; if there is no danger then we may simply have the time and place to watch the sun set, or watch the moon rise. This sort of thing feels most relevant in our modern case. We all have industry along with inner wishes that only reason can temper; doing so though is paramount so that our constructive efforts -which bring lasting joy- dont falter at the beckoning of a stiff back or full stomach.
            <br>&emsp;And I dont truly mean to say that our actions should regard our time after death, for I do see much strength in believing that such end is simply indifferent and natural. Only, this does not proclaim we do anything other than what our innate proclivities and interests fair us to do. Which is indeed fine and worth being grateful for: but any limit in knowing this condition of ours to be true, does render a proper stance of doubt, for if the truth is indeed otherwise, then our actions should have those ends in mind. “Since, by tradition’s sake, those alternatives are quite harsh and high staked comparably, in their judgments.” Which in some sense, is why the naturally indifferent truth is more fine and preferred: as we are at most sentenced to be ourself.

            The world is just weird. Were full of excitement and a good amount of cheer, yet no great amount of agreement with this will stall the idol and aimless feeling that corresponds with being out of shape. What I mean is that if we have less comfort and respect for ourselves, then other people's hopes and dreams will poorly rub against us, as well as opportunities being seen as less promising: for we have no aim. I've noticed though that in becoming richer and settled that our own personal composition and steps are easily set within the standard 'of simply being me'. We need not acquire or arrange for achievement; instead, we can strictly focus on and wish for the objects of our effort, or the interest and industry into formative creation, to be our forward path and leading direction. This compares with our legacy'd intent, wherein self importance deemed our rewards to match the caliber of the work I meant to do. In that case though, the burden of these creative demands saw me more still than moving; moreso, did the hopes and dreams that these achievements sensibly offered feel more unrealistic and narrow.
            <br>&emsp;An important parallel is this notion of being a success based on virtue or environment. In my case I always sat towards the former, growing confident that the latter would become easier to address. This is no longer applicable. Instead, our efforts are meant to treat us to the best that being our best accords. Put another way, if I am strong and free, than it is my open and wholesome heart that is providing: the offer is joy though. In other words, my interests in a stale state are those of circumstance -of which my wishes oblige. In a sounder and richer state, my claims are set on living well in abundance. Since that amounts to being active, regularly, then my consideration for what lies ahead corresponds to the kind of that hopeful expectation; in that, my wish is to live, and therefore what I wish to receive. "When I consider and account for my circumstances, or the simple needs for that living to be grasped, they are as a whole deemed and happily seen as motions and paths with righteous and flourishing activities as the lead." It is enough for me then to resolve myself to be who I am in this sort of way. Novelties are fine, and interests of the aesthetic sort will surely be capitalized upon if our fortune provides. These are all positions though. And be it preferable or not, or even objectively favorable or less so, it is who I am between that marks the point in which I will forever proceed. Moreover, in a few words or less, 'is that thing I wish for to be regardless of the position, for it is rooted in and baked towards the generous creation I produce, with living actively and roundedly as our gain'. "And this needs no other."
            <br>&emsp;In short, there is nothing for us to concern ourselves with aside from the coals which permit our hoped for living. To that, I personally would say that being able to sit comfortably and firmly, is the simple gate -or rather the line of which will reflect those ripe and leaner rewards. It is worth noting however that when it comes to opportunities and administrative tasks, that your favor is rightly sought for. The point though is that your choices and command should be at the most employed as the ultimate value of these things suggested. For example, if someone provides the chance to earn a fair share of money by simply filling out some forms, or perhaps it is a promising result based on performing a simple task, then your eligible oblige is truly worth admitting. However, if it is a permanent stay within a role that would truly hold you back from being as you ideally wished to be, then the comparably higher profits( in a monetary sake) would not be genuinely permitted. Now, you could choose the latter case and suspend your hopes for the finer horizon ahead. Be reminded though that those dreams are not waiting for you to be more consistent and set, rather they will falter away with the remission of their being targeted. From here the readied and unadorned decision to do something at the cost of your purer aims detriment, will consequently see that the wish for that place is less valued -leaving you with the complacent care for indulgence instead.
            <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, we should be mindful of our choices so that our genuine desires are met, or at least sought towards more clearly -wherein our step towards will be firmer and aimed. The point is that the world has both the means for action and comfort. Excitement and frivolity surround the latter, whilst integrity and rest sit by the former. How you spend your time and what consequence you wish for your choices to make, is determined ultimately by which side you lean upon. My preference is to hold my self in the highest regard, and deal with all the infidelities I contain so that I may sit easier and partake in the fertile and enjoyable activities of study and craft. I am not remissed though to make a choice that will remove friction from this path. I am, however, unobliged and without care to commit myself to efforts of a path which promises more than this simple smoothing; in that way, an interest in a certain profession or trip would seem to be rewarding, but my steadfastness notes that the required effort is more than I can ideally afford to contribute; moreso, that the reward on offer is a mere luxury and or garnish to my otherwise industrious and principled work. In other words, I weigh the expenses of things in terms of whether or not I will be sufficiently able to sit and work from there. Careers, the splendor and wares of travel, the general cost of restless moving and purchasing things, are neither desired or congenial to me. "Only those things, in the harshest way, are compatible if they legitimately encourage or support my hopes and wishes to sit and study, rest and read, run and write in the all the time around, as well as the passive time of motion pictures and gaming leisure -along with the simple act of enjoying the creations of all our youtuber friends- and doing so in all of this entirety by the virtuous principles and stability that allows for us to achieve this direction and state, consistently and in abundance -and perhaps with a friend ."

        <div id="interests">
            I feel as though a grip on our home and country would give us much more breathing room in terms of what we hope to see, as well as what is worthwhile to deem necessary in our ambitions. It goes, perhaps, under the notion that all is very similar and in addition vast; in that way, our interest in action and treatment is fairly unlimited in what candidates are set for this kind of care and disposal. Moreover, would our regard for our place as ones offering treatment, be equally worthwhile to address. In our living state, we are fine if food and warmth are acquired. The details of these do admittedly change as the world around alters back from winter to fall: within this cycle though there is merely an adjustment, for we as the bearers of appropriation remain. Therein, can I speak on behalf of one who is invested in constructing new ideas and furthering our active involvement to things; in this way, I mean to merely step forth with this direction in mind. That being said, our relevant stretch of time is under a few weeks. Ranges will generally overlap, but being in the soon to be mid January will comparatively differ upon reaching the beginning of February. The issue remains though that our steps are merely towards a lasting direction. Our ability to proceed though, and the ease by which we administer so is what that changing environment effects.
            <br>&emsp;Still, we will be going the same way, differing only in the firmness and state of our step's quality. To that, I would assess our present as sufficient within fitness's case, as well as being quite ordained to the weather and living scenario. Food is good and quick to come by, along with the space around and its suitability for the necessary training. Our time though seems less driven beyond these things. Perhaps it is because this base is settling so things around are given less attention and care, but I've noticed that in lacking so, the inner developments are receiving less of a pull to more quickly establish and proceed. Again, I don't mean to say that those things which a firmer setting would provide are worth rushing towards, at the expense of the foundations. It's worth noting though that in forgoing the disclosure of what those offered goods are, does our progression in becoming more constitutionally sound waiver a little, as it has less sight on what would amount to being sufficient.
            <br>&emsp;In other words, if we were able to do the things that we wanted regularly and reliably, then the means that got us there would be considered sound. However, if we in fact reached that state but knew not that it was what was desired -and in effect the point we had previously set to reach- then we may not settle and act as though we are still trying to advance. And that is fine for the most part. I would remark though that in those developing states that one may have less strictness in their prudence and less appreciation or care for the creative demands that their direction seeks. In this way our lack of awareness that our goal has been met will not see us adapt to being successful -which, compared to development, is a more immediate and rightly compulsive scenario, whereas the latter is generally more passive and waiting.
            <br>&emsp;To be personal and precise, there is much hope and value in laying out viable Tv shows and films as well as games -whilst accounting for the ones your presently in. Books are similar in expectations and current reflection. Moreso, are simple descriptions of the ideas or objectives within nature, prospects, Sums, truth, biographies(of yours too) and our personal training, quick and worthwhile to do. In this way, will our present be more substantial and knitted, as well as providing means to future instances or cares to be similarly addressed and elaborated upon.

        <div id="creation">
            Im looking to write a book called The Architect. Its main aim is to share the reasons for being formative and pure for the sake of achieving a well founded joy and reflected happiness. The meat on the bones though is troubling me. Foremost is the fact that the things I wish to include are not immediately relevant to describing that claim. The history of the world, philosophy and theology, fitness and our past, along with our hallmark use of the method within the implicit nature of sums, are together set as marks I hope to mention down this path: yet the end of the route is not evidently supported by these.
            <br>&emsp;A reiteration is likely important. That is the fact that I only mean to share. These things and the format that house them are personally of interest to me by virtue of construction and tribute. Offering the creation to others is merely an extension of how I am invested in the work in that their possible attention and care will further my accountability and resolve to be generous -wherein I live more. An idea is from one and for all. There are questions of absolute ontology, the firmness of natural existence and the reason for the implicit function of sums, that pull me forward on a quest to decipher. Moreso then, if everyone had already listened and given me a godly reward, those concerns would remain. Consequently, I will no matter my fortune proceed -for the action of doing is willfully provided.
            <br>&emsp;What I mean from this is that my interest in sharing my creation is simply a measure of what the developments mean to me. If other people care about the issue and its success, then our attempt to reach them will be ever more enriching. Again, the point, or the heart of it rather, is in the unknown's inquisition. On my own I would do this, and as that is my current state, it is what I will proceed to do. I wish for more though in the sense that my wish for these things is merely a mark for what suitably draws my innermost desire to contribute. The inclusion of other people heightens this value and consequently draws me to offer even more. Within the range of my isolated interest to the opposing side of total communal devotion, the line and mechanism of being is fully complete. It is worth noting that this path is a creative one, as if I were a painter trying to finish a portrait through my skill and craft whilst everyone around supported me and cheered -with each of us caring about the progress towards its completion. This initially seemed in contrast to the worship of a deity within religion, however I noticed that they are very much the same. The real distinction is that within a creative field you can be the god. This is because your creation is drawing other's interests, a position which you could find yourself (cheering) in to. That is actually a strong marker for 'from me to all of whom I see', as I am giving and feeling more as people attest to my effort, but am similarly provided with an equal place to attest to their own.

        <div id="prospects">
            "When I see you standing there I grit my teeth, for I know what is coming, the fortune of which bears me to be consistent -as the slight work required despite being increasingly rewarding, is still demanding the same." That notion of having to work forever is troubling. On one end if we knew, or at least suspected that our role would soon end, then the current task of it would drag me little. What I find most concerning is the remission this would remedy; the consequence being that we would live as if we were more free: for the future held no miserable end, and thus had no claim of our present apprehension. To my point, the actions and aims that followed from these open lanes reflect those things which you truly seek. What I wonder though is whether or not their metric is worth any less in a potentially troubled position. What would the promise of removing stress be earned from anyway, and earn you any more than what could be done in a narrowed place? Would those offerings not be from objectives in any case? "What goal could we not truly advance towards, of one that brought us joy that is, regardless of position?" My feeling is yes, yet our inquiry sees a mistake in seeing this acquisition as the greater claim. It may be that a situation that has more to offer will make you better off - thus justifying the anticipation from its offer. What I would propose though, is that we consider the nature of any situation, and whether or not there is a limit to what can cause distress; or in other words, is there any likelihood that more trouble and need of promise will follow, regardless of what you've so far claimed. "The pieces I am trying to link are that of this desire for remedying our position, put against and with supposition to the accompanying resolve to use the time diligently -as if you were free already."
            <br>&emsp;It feels like the harmony of our fortunes and the life we are living would be contrary to one another if their suitability was out of order. Put another way, if being well off truly meant what it'd mean, then would living well not be equally promised? My suspicion is that the means to living well are rooted in deliberation and its following action. The course of this is not removed or dampened as an ideal within any case or fortune. What it really suggests, is that even if times were poor, then we would still be better off in solidifying our aims. Even if we could not act upon them, our situation would only be limiting us in bringing out the way -not the fact that we have one. The issue arises that even if our time is well, that forging the way for living prosperously is in no shorter demand. From my inspection, I believe the strength of our criticism is in forgetting this point during our ambitions to improve our position: when the means to living well through deliberation is not given any meaningful regard, then the attempt to be better off will not treat you to anything more that being well, rather than living: and is the latter not what we truly seek? Is the shortcomings of it not the root of our feeling discontent -wherein our position is declared as poor and misfortuned?

        <div id="eastroad">
            As it were, we grew up near the Fraser Valley. As I grew older the interests I had did not specialize when it came to places and scenery, but the aim of Vancouver was at the forefront; at least the east was where I'd come from, while the west and the sunset is where I bore towards and strived. Now though, I am living near those ends. To the quality and condition I will not speak, but to the east road, that is where my care is placed. From our point near Main and Langara, the land is opportune for all sorts of findings. Down the hill there sits southern views, and moreso is Garden Centre a mere train ride away. Up north and into the woodland sits Granville and its mighty homes and trees; further west from that sits the flats of Arbutus; even further west sits the provincial forests and UBC.
            <br>&emsp;To the east though there sits a stretch of residents, and the means for views one seldom sees. Through the brief brush and past memorial sits Kensington park. Perched atop the peak of Knight Street, the steps here are prime for views of the north -and to all that offers, Kensington will be your treat. After this though the land is dead. The scope is still there but the slopes are uneven, blocking any strict and definite claim. Busing to the border of Burnaby, or trekking there at least, you'll reach the southern tip of Grandview; or rather, the mount of Renfrew and all her delights. Generally, this direction has two points after a divergence at the line of Kensington: make clear cut through the alleys and lanes till you reach Killarney, resting there before you head towards Maywood and Central Park, or, if you're going directly through Kensington, make for the split of Kingsway and Nanaimo, and pass through the bustle till you reach Slocan park. Once here, you can split off down towards Beaconsfield and John Henry park, or you can keep course alongside the south point of Renfrew Ravine until you hit Windemere. From this point, you can go one of two ways: turn south slightly and head towards the Marvelous Graham Bruce elementary, wherein your course is back to Collingwood for a return home or further eastern travel, or on the other hand, you can bank north towards the top of Fallaise at Renfrew Heights and see the marvel there, furthering into the top of Canada Way near Boundry and Cascade. "If your aim is Citedale(in north Burnaby) and the slopes around, then heading down to Rupert station will get you quickly to Brentwood. If you mean to go infront of BCIT and up to Royal Oak, then keep to Canada Way and pass through Broadview Park."
            <br>&emsp;Altogether, your midpoints of the East Road are Graham Bruce on 28th and Boundry, Metrotown and or Central Park, or the heights or Renfrew (or the Christian School shortly down). From here, as said, you may look for Northern Burnaby and Citedale Heights, or, more likely, further east towards Robert Burnaby and New West Minister. As it were, if you mean to go through Broadview and towards BCIT, then note that the Canada Way bus can always take you from any point until Royal Oak - whereby you can dismount and head up towards Metrotown (and Marlborough) - or continue to the east side of Deer Field Park or the top west side of Robert Burnaby near Lakeview Elementary. Note that once you pass Royal Oak, the land becomes very steep through Buckingham Heights; if you mean to go to Robert Burnaby or further into New West, then the Canada Way should be kept to. Unless you mean to circle back through Deer Field, there is nowhere but up to go. If your point was Graham Bruce, you can keep on foot down Praire and into the east side of Deer Field, banking up towards Metrotown, or continuing east through the park; otherwise, you can keep higher up and go through Inman Elementary, reaching Marlborough near Royal Oak. If your wish is to keep east from this line, then keeping down Oakland Street will take you along the mid slopes of Buckingham; turning up the hill will quickly take you to Kisbey, or further on you can turn up Walker -or the many streets that will take you south and up the hill- to reach Edmunds Park and its forest lane. Another option from Graham Bruce is taking a brief walk south to Collingwood to take the Expo to your further destination. In a similar way, if your point is near Central Park, you may head for the Expo if your aims are more eastern, or you can keep further south and head across the banks of Southern Burnaby -whose views of the land are uniquely wide and open.
            <br>&emsp;Whether you are trekking there through the Expo, or reaching it from Deer Field and or Marlborough, or the south strip of Burnaby, Edmunds marks the center for your eastern gain. Rounded against the flat top of Buckingham to the north, and west of the slopes of New West and Glenbrooke, Edmunds is the switch off point for those traveling eastwards. If you have come from the north, then Edmunds will transition towards New West; or if you've come from the west, by foot or train, Edmunds will shoulder your bend down and towards Robert Burnaby or the lane beyond. In this area, the land is sloped south. Before the steep side onto downtown New West, there is the neighborhood of Glenbrook, with its many highrises and parks around -including Queen Elizabeth. Up on the north side of the slope runs 10th Ave. From here and the roads above, the way is carved east towards the edge of New West and the valley beyond. Once you pass Canada Way and Cumberland, the north becomes blocked by the forests covering the nearby peak; instead, the east opens up and you can see the lands near your older home. At the end sits Cariboo Park, whose side and view are open and wide. "Compared to wonders of Graham Bruce, the immediacy of Golden Ears and Maple Ridge seems relatively less distant, as if we were close." This spot marks the end of our territory and sets the beginning of that which used to bear our home. The way home is a short stroll down the hill to the Expo line. Otherwise, the sundering hill of Cariboo holds no limit for what you can see, and how long. That is the Great East Road.

        <div id="renfrew">
            As a quick note, this area is interesting for its military based naming within the local neighborhood. The standouts are Normandy Street, Dieppe, Vimmy and Malta. Anyways, these streets actually mark the slope of the Renfrew area. At its foot runs Grandview highway, beginning at Boundry and ending near Commerical. At the bottom sits Falaise Park; here, she runs up at three different levels, each offering a great view of the Lions from the east. At the top there is the Vancouver Christian school, which holds a stretch of field with a strong amount of scenery and scope. Even higher sits the peek of Renfrew Heights: here, there spans a plot of grass with a view of Downtown sharp and kind.
            <br>&emsp;On the back of this runs Boundary Road. From the south to the north, this marks the border between Vancouver and Burnaby. Settled right beside Renfrew Heights is Cascade. This little neighborhood holds the general hospital, a marvel up the road, and the end of Canada Way -where I lived for a short while, some time ago. That marvel is from Graham Bruce Elementary. The reason for its prowess is in the slight slope it has over the surrounding lands; other than a separate viewpoint nearby in Burnaby, this place is the only way to see the east with clarity. "And seeing Golden Ears rooted in the distance, what a seldom treat!" I remember waking up one morning to go west, but coming south initially. It was early and the blue had just begun to mix with the red, making the sky slightly burnt as the darkness receded. There were no strict clouds in the sky, only mere wisps which caught the burning light. Going up Boundry I rested at Graham for the first time, peering far off to the lands I once called home, and relishing the fact that Golden ears could be seen. "That is a marvel, as it offers the good only found in its position. Garden Center in Richmond, Moberlay in South Van and Marlborough foremost near Metrotown, are equal members of that group."
            <br>&emsp;A quick mention of that little area which I lived -up the road from Graham Bruce. I did so for a short few months during the summer of 2021. Notably, a forest ran down the street from me. It had a little park and a little field, though the views were not significant. Moreso however, was a little wooded path that rain cleanly through the brush. Coming to the west, it came out in line with my house up the street, but opened into an abandoned clearing near the start of Boundary and Grandview. "I came here and sat often, gazing onto the northern mountains, treated to the Lions especially." Having moved home afterwards, this feeling was not lost; having moved back to Vancouver but in a more sheltered and wooded setting, has me missing those peaks and scenery."
            <br>&emsp;To wrap up I'll mention some points of interest nearby -and outside any particular area. Three that come to mind are Renfrew Park further down Grandview -which had a pool, library, fair views and a rustic ravine. Windemere - which sat nearby but up higher- and its vast northern views, along with the size of the fields which offered them. Then John Henry park, which was more like a complex full of trees, many fields and a lake inside. A quick addition is a personal favorite called Beaconsfield. Settled neatly between Renfrew and John Henry, this park has two soccer fields stacked on top of one another, making one long stretch of grass; as well, there are a few openings where the Lions can be seen. As a place then, with the high school track down the street, makes this spot at the very least useful. Considering that it is not too far down the street from Superstore, makes it a more promising locale -at least when it comes to ones that are settled far away.

        <div id="violence">
            Seneca mentions, briefly, the philsopher Brutus, who mentions the request of crowds and their plea for Gladiators to accept tbeir deaths, willingly. "They throw their arms in errupt if one is to beg or run away," he says, "They want all to stand, with ferocity, accepting their path to try and fight." They are hear for entertainment after all ; running aside tempers the mood when all who've arrived did so, only, to see the spectacle ; cowards pin the excitment.
            <br>&emsp;The mention here from Brutus has Seneca playing his pithy, yet welcomed ways. He makes suggestions, aimed at those given such request, that if your place is death in the ring, or anywhere else, he states, for the matter, that offering your throat, literally, or not and with grace elsewhere, gives freedom over fortunes pull, by winds or the crowd.
            <br>&emsp;This sentiment is quite personal to me. In my younger years I struggled grealty with grusome fear and violence, scared at least, like a prick in my side, by the depcitions at least. My response was always to deny the existence of such reality. From that position I still hold, only, now, there is no fight ; I have already won. In that place of deciet and pillagry, true or not, my case is made by the claim I have on my stake, from offering my throat, freedom is gained. Fear, thus, has no make ; Victory has her gain. What I enjoy the most is being the banker, holding her profits. "The best friendship is one where you share the profits. I feel best then, with Victory as an ally and, beating fear earns all worth in triumph."

        <div id="firstprinciple">
            Our first principle shares the heart of Descarte's example(to speak of one), where he claims that he exists due to his thinking. This notion reflects a maxime, or rather a fundamental point which other proposals work from. In our case we will address the fact that our thinking is the most prominent feature of ourselves; moreso, does it's place feel the furthest when placed within inquiries or consideration. As actions, these reflect the kind of path which we'll take moving forward; as a baseline though, our first principle is revealed. Through thought, we can assess what the foremost meaning of our thinking is: and that is simply the fact that we are limited. In short, if one is absolute, then they are greater than all things which are less so. For the sake of being explicit, will we regard our need and very ability to inquire as a sign of our shortcoming, wherein our otherwise place above would require no thought or consideration - where it's would be acceptably absent. Since we are present to it, we are therefore below that greatest place: and as a position that holds such limits, our resolve should root itself with respect to that way. In technical terms, this is our ontology; what it means however, or rather what it is that it suggests we do, is marked in the essence of how we came to know. As one of thought, and our assessment that this is all we can at the utmost be, marks our furthest and greatest claim as one within actions of a similar kind. "As thinkers, our thought is our highest way. The nature of this is then built upon things appropriate to its kind: logic, probability, analysis, consideration etc. Since these mental aspects are the greens of our essence, then the highest mark and measure that is relevant to us will be within these kinds." What that is reflects the limit, wherein the reach of our being as thinkers was less than all: and we at most could know that. Seeing as this most rooted claim is born of thoughtful action,than would the imperative to act on it, or in other words respect the finding, not be of a similar sort? Put another way, does our reflective being suggest what our resolute and objective way should be?
            <br>&emsp;I did not mean to elaborate on this much further than the mention of first principles and ontology; and I don't mean to continue. As much as this sentiment is worthwhile though, there is still much more to say. Objectively, determining a first principle offers you the means for a sound and able philosophy. That this itself is valued I cannot say. However, what it entails we can at least describe - and therefore elaborate on what it contains, and how it may be desirable. Having a philosophy that has roots in this well founded sense, gives way to two main things: Theology and Ethics. To the former, this remarks the notion of how things will end; in our case, our limit merely suggests that ours will be peaceful and free. Moreso then, to the latter, will this sound casing of a principle and its end, give way for a proper resolve, as our actions are set within fuller frame - the adherence and demonstration of which constitutes ethics. Objectively then, will our aims of living well and reaching success, have a firmer and solid foundation to build from. This is, foremost, because onto those things which we mean to work on, as well as the desires and interests we seek and wish to obtain, will have a sharper measure as to judge their value and place. Consequently, when it comes to being mature and reasonable, will our actions sprout from and bend towards the congruence of that - the gain of which will be the sound and true victory we seek.

            Rationality describes one’s state within their resolve to reason. Reason, reflects the interpretation of the world through a lens that rewards the user with an experience better set to the laws of nature, the alignment of which results in true justice. In other words, reason is what discerns the mold for proper action. Friendship then marks the companionship of those who would share their quest to be so well ordained. The reasoning of either may differ (though slightly, I reckon), but each other’s reverence and resolution to be as good as their inspection relies, bears encouragement from both sides. “As they say then, a friend is one who will tell you when you are falling short within your reason; or, they reassure you that rationality is the right way to be when your mind is struggling or with doubt; as well, if you succeed appropriately, then they congratulate you and confirm the soundness of your success, and fairly mention when not.” Someone who boasts you up for being irregular and frivolous is no real friend. Even though they may be a companion of sort, it is only within a sort of reason that any trajectory has any stay or merit; therefore, a lack of meaningful resolution is unsuitable for any decent collaboration. Put another way, if a thief has a friend, then their support is to one another’s place in the bottom.
            <br>&emsp;Individually then, our place will be best when it is set where it ought to be within that allied fashion: but the tying factor should be elements derived from reason. Seeing as the requirements are rooted in the merits of supporting each other in working towards such(appropriate) reasonability, then we could illustrate this otherwise by saying ‘that what is good is what should be sought as one, and thus with another’. In other words, if a friendship is truly the greatest thing, it is because it purports and nourishes the progress and sustenance towards goodness and (fair) contribution.  The mark of this then, as the measure of what is good together, will similarly stain the clothes of one who is embellished and administered through actions on their own. “Alone then may we pleasantly travel.” For, if a wandering passer-by comes near our way, we will have a proper scale to assess whether they are suitable to join us; moreso we can be sociably kind if our own aims are well ingrained and furnished: for we will be both satisfied with our own place and direction, and be therefore more able and willing to help the stranger reach for their own particular ways and interest. “And at any rate have the means for proper judgment, so that their poor aims -and according scale- don’t become our own.”

        <div id="intothefray">
            They say that the toughest job of the gods was in creating the mold for justice. In other words, as Plutarch says, ‘instilling the framework for proper action was the foremost thing that the workmen of reality had to consider in their construction’. The question that is most personal to me though, or thing that I would foremost remark, is that in terms of that construction, I am blind as to what they mean for me to do. One side I am clear on though is what this alignment would bring; rather, I know that the right reward is one of genuine rest and joy. “Or better said, despite my ignorance of what nature is and what she wishes me to do, I do know what would qualify a result as being fitting; for I at the very least know it would be positive; and at any rate, in considering how certain members have proper resolves fitting for them, so am I sure that whatever such fine actions were for men, that doing so would yield the qualities of constance, flavor and ease. In that I am sure.” 
            <br>&emsp;Despite this, our assessment of the law (or nature) and our proper oblige towards it, fairs some trouble.  This is not so due to any limits in assessment, or any fair ones at that, but our judgment rather. For example, there are two games, each with their own rules. One group of people plays one and another plays the other; within each side those involved respect and adhere to the rules and are, for the sake of argument, just. The question though, is who (or what rather) determines whether you should play this or that game? Some may conclude that any action, or rule for that matter, is set for congruence, and thus the measure of our time is not what we choose, rather that we would bring ourselves well in whatever we do. I would raise the concern then that murdering folks may have a better way of doing it. I would expand upon this though by saying that our pretension of what murder is rests inside an assortment of other interactions that must equally be accounted for -so we can dismiss that for the moment. This sentiment can be iterated on until you reach the entirety of things which must be accounted for in order to be all encompassingly proper. “That is, without an ultimate rule, or at least understanding of how all things are, then any truth in what you actually should do is limited.”
            <br>&emsp;In any case, you have two choices: address the whole in all its workings, however limited, and make yourself towards that, or suspend your belief that all can be known and accounted for and instead be simply resolved within your principled spirit. On the latter, in other words, we may accept that we are not going to know why being philanthropic or collaborative is truly good or not, but can then fairly and plainly bring a centering attitude of kindness and humility into whatever comes our way. “Which is itself a sound assumption, albeit one still.” 
            <div class="qu">Being just means properly following the law; the law though in a strict sense can expand further than our common grounds can see -even through the strongest lens- and being able to address what it needs is consequently hard. On the other side, is a more open yet incomplete approach (within a strict measure), whereby you make a lesser address of the law and simply be who you are best at being. Again, if your nature and or behavior has you partaking in the acts of a serial killer, this may not be the best of you. And we could say conversely that someone who is naturally accepting and expressive towards gregarity and maturity, holds an obviously preferred measure. “But so are we merely tending our time, as opposed to bending it towards some truth”</div>
            The question then, is how can we say that something is right or wrong if the overall law is not fully understood? Perhaps the recognition of each side necessitates a developing process wherein we accept who we are as terrestrial beings with the capacity to reflect, but lack (for the moment) the entire picture. Personally, I recommend that we stake ourselves on the point that got us here in both the acceptance we made of our limitations, along with the humble resolve to move forth into the fray as we deem fit: whereby theft and perjury were seen as poor, for nothing more than the contrary pull against the goods of what’s plain and common. The point we will have reached then will be one administered for the sake of what’s clear, rather then well known -as the latter had been decidedly limited. Our progress then -per the term- would bring us but closer through the fray. “Whereby we accepted our place within it, merely advancing.”  It seems most fitting then for our response (to nature and her ways) to be as ones of likeness and strength, rather than misrepresenting our place as if we had discovered the law, or whats true -which, to our point, lies incomplete.
        </div>
        <div id="discipline">
            Something must be addressed for the sake of naming our limit. That, is the sentiment that goodness and our reverence towards it, reflects a congruence towards the way things are; whether the good is more in line with our resolve or within the accuracy of the aim itself, we can say that the need is for a mix of the two. The problem though wherein our limit falls is what is actually the right thing to do. They say that being just is when the actor is in line with the law; moreover, would we say they are principled when their actions are ingrained and adorned to this proper way, as opposed to our efforts being reminiscent of what is inbred and innate. Now, akin to the Dialectic will our assessment of reality and the law it proposes be a continuous one. Perhaps this is ultimately true so long as that prior notion of being bestial is true; in that case we would say that our place in the world as men is one where those irrational sides of ourselves are mended, and instead we bend towards reason and rationality -rather, our actions being staked towards the findings from reason. That is the way I suppose. We are those with the ability to sense and care, but this is built from a lineage of weariness and irresolve. Our actions then seem principally necessary to be encased within the discipline of being attentive and considerate so that we may more accurately see the world. Therein, will our actions that follow, from rationality, be more adapt to the way things truly are.
            <br>&emsp;Therefore, my resolution is to fall back onto reason; furthermore, will our place as actioned beings see us kneel to such findings and compliantly respond. This will illustrate the point. As old men or monkeys, we acted upon the dangers we supposed because our senses suggested them. That a lion or tiger was infront of us is no flawed worry and is fairly just if the response is to run. When there is an earthquake though and our inability to discern the cause is overwhelming, then believing that we are being set out upon by something either maniacal, or someone good who is reflecting mere disappointment -and a therein corresponding need to be cherished- is both foolish, nieve, ill composed and, to the former, psychotic. The point I mean to draw though is that our actions were not there because these particular kinds of impressions and prompts were uniquely innervating; rather, I suggest that it is our nature as beings who act upon the insight and or happenings of the world and, therein, respond because that is what we are made to do. If you can follow this, then I would propose that our formative and preventative efforts are best when cased in reason, for their basis will be on a truth born from deliberation and thoughtfulness, compared to those which are of an impulsive and ignorant manner. Herein, could we say, in summary, that if our actions are going to be at all, and will serve us towards what we believe is just, than that accuracy of reason will give the inevitable running bull a clearer lane(so to speak). Concerning us then, will this result in our evident efforts having a more promising and profitable target. In other words, we, as our being suggests, will make for something in any case: the use of and aim of reason, is to set that way through the sensible confinement of our minds onto the world.
            <br>&emsp;Let us distinguish the difference between reason and rationale. The former reflects one's action to uncover and define the world and its way. "It is through reason that we discover and refine our view of the law more accurately." In contrast, our primitive assessment would define the world on the basis of impulse and ignorance, whereas reason seeks to explore and elaborate upon the workings of things around us from a deliberate and thought out way. Secondly then, to the latter, we can say that our rationale is our reason for doing something, as it seemingly pruports the law. In other words, the rationale for having a strong offense is that it allows for both the increased opportunity of scoring as well as providing an effective means for defense. The rationale though in doing this is reflective of our aim to score, as our assessment showed that the point of the game was to do so; how we amend to this task is where our actions are aligned as to be congruent to the aim (laid by reason) and thus given a rationale towards it. "That this will be effective considering what I mean to achieve." The rationale for doing the many things that amount to living however is unclear in a strict way. This is because our reason for living is ultimately ill defined. We do have ideas, but they are at best sown together and given a color that rewards us for being amended to them, though only enough so that we may earn what it is as inquiries seek, along with being able to further our definition. The issue though, as is in some way the case of dialectic, is whether or not the aim should be to continue to cycle, or reach the case where 'the' answer is known. I suspect that even if there were an absolute answer, our actionable status would interact with the results from our resolve and therein find more to consider. This is all a very difficult thing to do.

        <div id="farshores">
            We will die and that’s ok. Foremost, is this the case for the appreciation we have in the temporary side of living that constitutes the flip side of the story. Hereby, we’ll revere the fact that this gift of joy and activity was given; moreso, we’ll simply refer to this time as the living state of our being, upon which end we will enter a state of rest. “To peace then we will expect.”
            <br>&emsp;As for what we should do prior, this grounds itself through resolutions born from thoughtfulness. Let us say that mortality and its pleasing condition bears offers to how we should approach it. In that way, those efforts we consider will have an indifferent end by which they make, wherein the hope for such activities require nothing more than reaching that place through our strongest step; this occurs when the regard for where they are headed is not ill arranged, or banked outside the activity itself -and its actual claim of living. In other words, if we are living well, then this will be accountable by virtue of us being steadfast and clear onto our anticipated end. This is opposed to wishing for something other -which is in fact untrue- and placing our efforts towards there. Instead, we should bend ourselves to the proper mold depicted by the prior sentiment. “Which is that our end is coming, necessarily, but of rest and ease is all it will be: where we thus happily comply, in living to then with peace and ”
            <br>&emsp;Specifically though, since our time is not right outside of proper living, then we ought to propose what those appropriate actions are. For one, we don’t fully know. This is perhaps because our resolve to meet death peacefully is one based on a valid assumption. Despite our confidence, the end may not be as we take it, and the possibility for mistaking that renders our fundamental resolve at the most likely. Seeing as our actions have no strict measure, we can still uphold the reasonable bound within that wholesome limit. In that case, our interests pull the bill; moreso, does our formative treatment of them mark the height in which their attention can treat. However, it is worth noting that these inclinations that one may have -which in some way is what we are talking about- are really our innate tendencies and desires convening with candidates for relations. For example, we are able to see for the sake of vision and its utility within survival; if there is no danger then we may simply have the time and place to watch the sun set, or watch the moon rise. This sort of thing feels most relevant in our modern case. We all have industry along with inner wishes that only reason can temper; doing so though is paramount so that our constructive efforts -which bring lasting joy- dont falter at the beckoning of a stiff back or full stomach.
            <br>&emsp;And I dont truly mean to say that our actions should regard our time after death, for I do see much strength in believing that such end is simply indifferent and natural. Only, this does not proclaim we do anything other than what our innate proclivities and interests fair us to do. Which is indeed fine and worth being grateful for: but any limit in knowing this condition of ours to be true, does render a proper stance of doubt, for if the truth is indeed otherwise, then our actions should have those ends in mind. “Since, by tradition’s sake, those alternatives are quite harsh and high staked comparably, in their judgments.” Which in some sense, is why the naturally indifferent truth is more fine and preferred: as we are at most sentenced to be ourself.
        </div>
        
        <div id="sweetends">
            I think that our most truthful and core being is unlimited when it comes to application and resolve. As I like to say, if we were in a dungeon we could still reflect on the fact that our ends were the same as those of kings or any freeman at least. Moreover, could I repent for the injustice that I had produced, or be grateful for what I still had and who I was if the injustice was served to me. This is a baseline for me personally.
            <br>&emsp;In the middle somewhere is someone who has a little place to live, the basics of food and leisure, and the sparse amount of work to simply fit this line, but nothing more. At that point there is no injustice, merely poor choices (and perhaps disposition) that muddied our natural paces away from more lucrative lines. In any case, if your plain living has you drawn to far-off fortunes or the mere remedies of excitement, I would advise that you relish how much is already available by your very presence in and wherever you are.  From the freedom to exist in your country -unlike those kept in a cell- you are can rejoice in all that dangles in and amongst the air. The clouds offer a mix of colors and size, the sky similarly; the moon, sun and stars spin forever on, even in the winter and its chilling cold. No matter the day there is something promising, even if we cannot at the moment see it: but we can be sure that the extent of our liberty reaches there, in promise at least. And beyond these tender basics there are still opportunities that you can pursue, be it of profession, trade or craft. Your lands are without war and unbridled crime, nor is there mischief and despotic rule in any civil sense. “More than those gifts of nature’s treats and your license to experience them, so can you expand your time and effects into the rural world, none are stopping you: your talents and attire are openly set. And whether you can or not, it is not due to what is hindering you; at least if there is some of that, blame nature and her principle conditions, but not the laws and conduct of man. Any shortcomings there are due to you not being one yourself.”      
            <div class="qu"></div>We are free and this entails we have a baseline of consideration and care 
            Regarding the quality of our free time, or of those things which mark our liberty, our interest on the whole is to throw ourselves in and fully engage. This is why labors (and comparable kinds of work) are so gruesome as they are done so with reluctance and friction. And although some roughness can be removed through personal adjustment and gratitude for what said actions bring, there is still at most an increase in smoothness and amiability, but nothing which compares to those liberal activies -and their saturation of flourishing glee. Still, the leaves on the tree and the fruit from the buds need some bark to grow on; and as a whole one could not employ themselves into a gracious space that was paired with being rational and free, and not respect and equally indulge in the fact that these goods we have and seek are born from and in requirement of the means that brought them there. 
            <div class="qu"></div>Such responsibilities and demands mark our civil agreement, whereby we participate in the world to earn us the basic things we need, and then enjoy our freedom to indulge in the fruits and treats we seek
            The heart of this though are those sweeter kinds of a reward. Compared to the security and fullness that you get from doing your duties well, those things which draw your creativity and lightness of touch provide more means of trust and rigor into your heart -whereas the latter gives more stretch to your bones, and settles them in. The effort that we truly seek are those ones in which we offer ourselves for the sake of contribution. In the case of our tasks and roles, we are simply trying to finish something -or at least reach a point where the goods of freedom begin. Our treatment of the world, in that sense, can never blossom enough and rewards us for ever doing so. I would illustrate this as if we were painting a portrait, in that we were satisfied in drawing the curves and shades of our line, but were then equally pleased in seeing the figure come together as a whole. On one hand, it might strictly be nice to look at, or draw you to feel a certain way by its gravity and strength. As the makers though there is something for us, or at the very least who know enough to be able to see the innermost and connecting parts. In that case, it is the stance of one familiar enough to find an appreciation, that such individual things could come together into this whole, and set itself apart as a complete form through and by these particular lines and pieces. It is as if we can see the delicacy and touch that went into shaping and setting each color, shade and line. In other words, our able eye can set back with a gaze that sees the whole for its entirety; but sifting through the sides are all the edges and places that bring all this together to form such union, whereby our delight and fulfillment is kindly pressed onto the time spent and seemingly produced into a unique portion. Therein, is that small piece that makes it more than just a whole, for we see it only with our own gracious claim as a thing that is marbling our baser impression of the whole.  
            <div class="qu"></div>The world thus, as I see it, is already smoldering and claimed when it comes to our viable treatment. Therefore, I suggest that we extract ourselves out of misery and dissent, and place our attention instead onto the priority setting of reverence, treatment, honor and care. “Doing so onto the workings of and development into the righteousness and reverence of either right or countering wrong, will give us an invincible claim, of which no dungeon or hell could protrude.”
        </div>
        <div id="ceaseofwrath">
            The world is just weird. We’re full of excitement and a good amount of cheer, yet no great amount of agreement with this will stall the idle and aimless feeling that corresponds with being out of shape and flat minded.  The consequent lack of comfort and respect for ourselves sees other people’s hopes and dreams rubbing against me, nor the opportunities of mine seeming as promising. “As generally, this dull state I’m in removes any notion of aims, and any ability of having one at that.”
            <br>&emsp;Despite such comparisons, I have noticed that in taking more time to become more rich and settled inwardly, our personal composition and steps have become both easier and firmer -aimed, if you will- and brought a simple standard ‘of simply being me’. As it were, we need not acquire or arrange for achievement; instead, we can strictly focus on and wish for the objects of our effort, or the interest and industry into formative creation, to be our forward path and leading direction. This compares with our legacy’d intent, whereby self importance deemed our rewards to match the caliber of the work I meant to do. In that case though, the burden of these creative demands saw me more still than moving; moreso, did the hopes and dreams that these achievements sensibly offered feel more unrealistic and narrow. And as a result, we wore ourselves out to an unproductive degree, which had me feeling both frail and stiffened (and accordingly idle), all while being burnt by other’s apparent successes, or pursuits at any rate.
            <br>&emsp;An important parallel is this notion of being a success based on virtue or environment. In my case I always sat towards the former, growing confident that the latter would become easier to address. This is no longer applicable. Instead, our efforts are meant to treat us to the most that being our best affords. Put another way, if I am strong and free, than it is my open and wholesome heart that is providing; and the offer is joy, but only. In other words, my interests in a stale state are those of circumstance -of which my wishes oblige. In a sounder and richer state, my claims are set on living well in abundance. Since that amounts to being active, regularly, then my consideration for what lies ahead corresponds to that kind of hopeful expectation; in that, my wish is to live, and is therefore what I wish to receive. When I consider and account for my circumstances then, or the simple needs for that living to be grasped, they are as a whole deemed and happily seen as motions and paths with righteous and flourishing activities as the lead, or gain rather whereby their effectiveness is weighed against. It is enough for me then to resolve myself to be who I am in this sort of way. Novelties are fine, and interests of the aesthetic sort will surely be capitalized upon if our fortune provides. But these are mere positions though. And be it preferable or not, or even objectively favorable or less so, it is who I am between that marks the point in which I will forever proceed. Moreover, in a few words or less, ‘that thing I wish for, regardless of the position, is rooted in and baked towards the generous creation I produce, with living actively and roundly as our gain’. 
            <div class="qu"></div>And this needs no other
            In short then, there is nothing for us to concern ourselves with aside from the coals which permit our hoped for living. To that, I personally would say that being able to sit comfortably and firmly, is the simple gate -or rather the line of which will reflect those ripe and leaner rewards. It is worth noting however that when it comes to opportunities and administrative tasks, that your favor is rightly sought for. The point though is that your choices and command regarding these tasks (and according acquisitions) should be at most employed as our highest values suggests -or afford at any rate. For example, if someone provides the chance to earn a fair share of money by simply filling out some forms, or perhaps it is a promising result based on performing a simple task, then your eligible oblige is truly worth admitting. However, if it is a permanent stay within a role that would truly hold you back from being as you ideally wished to be, then the comparably higher profits (in a monetary sense) would not be genuinely permitted. Now, you could choose the latter case and suspend your hopes for the finer horizon ahead. But be reminded that those dreams are not waiting for you to be more consistent and set, rather they will falter away with the remission of their being targeted. “That is what I have seen at least, or, better said, that withering of preferred sights is what my ambitions have dealt me.” 
            <div class="qu"></div>Simply put, the readied and unadorned decision to do something at the cost of your purer aims, will consequently see their place become less valued, leaving you with the complacent care for indulgence and novelty instead
            In any case, we should be mindful of our choices so that our genuine desires are met, or at least sought towards more clearly -as to make our steps firmer and aimed. The point is that the world has both the means for action and comfort. Excitement and frivolity surround the latter, whilst integrity and rest sit by the former. How you spend your time and what consequence you wish for your choices to claim, is determined ultimately by which side you lean upon. My preference is to hold myself in the highest regard, and deal with all the infidelities I contain so that I may sit easier and partake in the fertile and enjoyable activities of study and craft. I am not remissed though to make a choice that will remove friction from this path. I am, however, unobliged and without care to commit myself to efforts of a path which promises more than this simple smoothing; in that way, an interest in a certain profession or trip would seem to be rewarding, but my steadfastness notes that the required effort is more than I can ideally afford to contribute; moreso, that the reward on offer is a mere luxury and or garnish to my otherwise industrious and principled work. In other words, I weigh the expenses of things in terms of whether or not I will be sufficiently able to sit and work from there. Careers, the splendor and wares of travel, the general cost of restless moving and purchasing things, are neither desired or congenial to me. Only those things, in the harshest way, are compatible if they legitimately encourage or support my hopes and wishes to do as I genuinely please. And again, I mean not to discredit or ignore the rewards of those orbiting pleasures and aims: but I must and am happier to value and prioritize those which are close to me, ‘as they are not exotic and trivial, but dear’.
        </div>
        <div id="ofmen">
            I would benefit from knowing the whole of things as well as those particular to me. For one, if my scope of knowledge is increased then my vanity will wain; as well, if we then turn to see what it is we actually have, then we won’t be so discontent or impotent on the notion ‘that this is where we are stuck’. This sentiment applies across a broad stretch of things. Putting forth the points relevant to us will yield a better view -of which the whole can wrap around. On the biggest scale, our place in the universe is waiting for pure definition. Beginning with our locale in the galaxy and its place within the local group, followed by the arrangement within the local cluster and its position within the Virgo Super cluster, and that place within the great Herculean Wall, summarizes our whereabouts. Our developments among life is also significant. From the earliest cells to fish, to basic land animals to the dinosaur kings, to mammals and bears, apes then humans, down the lane we’ve come. “Our present though has been reached after a long way.” Some insight here can relieve us of our ignorance within human activity as well as giving us more grace ‘as our cities and tools appear more fortuned’. Regarding our path of intent -in studying this- it begins with cosmogony, leading into cosmology and the formation of our sun and planet. Following this is the development of life alongside the solidifying of Earth’s surface and core; complexity arrives in both the environment and its inhabitants, culminating into a more tame set of species, including man. Beginning with migration and the early use of tools, we eventually reach a point of consolidation into agricultural societies, wherein the need and case for religious and judicial governance emerge.
            <br>&emsp;The peak of civilization rests on the inquiry of those who have surpassed our survival condition, proceeding rather to ask how within this freedom and divine view we should live our lives. Bureaucracy prevails though, temporarily at least. Outlasting this are the arrangements of a basic culture rooted in theology, being later surpassed by one baked within the senses and their deployment onto nature. Upon that is the imperative of civil liberty along with the imaginative limits reached within that natural approach. Strict resolutions are henceforth made and explicit regimes of society emerge, reflecting the polar response of an unknown world. “As, compared to the laws given by priests, the tenants of liberty and authority (in the civil sphere) are but suggested, however strongly.” The result is man’s ingenuity to command the bases of matter amidst his social conflicts, whereby his own destruction is gripped in the palm of his hand; he releases the trigger though as his corresponding aim is relaxed upon seeing how stern and narrowed his views were -and how unnecessary the certain devastation would be. He opens up, too much for some (as in the hippies), but in general tries to be more cooperative, establishing pacts of non violence and stupidity. The bulk of these efforts greatly outweighs the contrasting fools who ideologically remain; the playing field is so flat though that personal interest becomes more valued and agreed upon -this is due to the natural world still being in place, and despite there being no carnivorous buffoons, vanity still remains -which triggers an entitled response within an agreeable environment. The freedom that follows generates a similar response as those who became judicially narrow, only in this case the demanding nature is found within common civilities -gay rights for instance, in contrast to the previous prevalence of worrying about whether society should be communist or democratic. In this though, the conflicts are between folks rather than government. The process of this drains people into valuing the noise lesser and lesser, and instead, finding more useful and private means within the modern infrastructure.
            <br>&emsp;It seems that the reach of our day is one where freedom is left to vehemently reign. The conditions of life still remain though and the open lane to organize ourselves to respond leads to a restrictive view. I make this point to draw the conclusion that this kind of behaviour will in many ways remain. “Of dissatisfaction that is, despite our freedoms.” This is due to the ever present (and lasting) emotional response to the constant reality of the world. The issue, is that these extreme freedoms and openness are not given a humbling address. “Whereas we would be best to acknowledge that these fortunes were there to further allow us to survive, people take the vain novelties of this and act as though the fruits and wares of that are what needs protecting.” Consequently, even though contemporary advancements allow for such aims to be either taken or defended, the core implodes. “For how sad and free are we with all this fighting? It is like a King who has all, yet upon getting a little more becomes even more afraid that some will be lost -and he acts accordingly.” In contrast to this fact, is that people’s lows are (from modernity) high enough to be pleasing on their own. “Only the rich these days will act like the wealthy of old.” Those poor, have the modern taste, and are in fact much better off then those who were similarly classed in older times. That is our place.
            <br>&emsp;My point in all of this, for resolution’s sake, is that being included is merely optional. There are admittedly civil adjustments enacted by establishments and social custom, but being appropriately polite and kind seems completely sufficient in ignoring any sort of prompt or ask -for in this their concern is not triggered or applied. How this comes into effect consequently, is that people will use the freedom that they have to better address the forever remaining problems of the world. Compared to those who heatedly get sucked in and look only to remove difficulties -and ignore that we generally have what we need- this new flock of people will use the open tools and platform currently available to not simply bring the world to a necessary standard, but into a flourishing state, whereby the excesses bring those impoverished to a fairer level, but also into the marblings of the world, whereby similar fruits to the Renaissance are present and growing. “The excesses of positive ingenuity if you will; which in those older times birthed the explosive advents of science and liberty: ought we not have such fruits in this mighty modern age?”
            <div class="qu"></div>As Orwell has remarked within similar reflections about this, the current goal of man is not to remove any more of  his edge -or friction rather- but rather remark how amidst these freedoms,  he will actually live.

        <div id="ongreatness">
            As men and women, we are trying the manifest the best version of ourselves. Morseo, though, is this gain meant to be sustained, consistent that is. On one end you could say that our need to be so stout reflects the principle in play: where we fundamentally resolve ourselves to be strong and true. However, if this state is sought for beyond natural necessity, rather it is valuable to reach by a desire, then our meeting such point is consequently worthwhile to remain at -so we may continuously earn its treat. This is comparable to that old notion of reason’s constant place. In that case, it was suggested that since our achievements needed the accompaniment of reason in order to yield an accomplishment -for appreciation and use was genuinely made of the result- then we would also need her for the subsequent deliberation. The point there was that if the accomplishments were to be consistent then reason would have to ever remain by our side, thus making it a frequent member of all our positions, particularly when it comes to whereafter we set forth. How this compares to the value of greatness is that upon reaching this point, you will want to remain; in effect, our need for it and aim will not falter as we acquire it; rather, we will only see more of its use and reward for achieving so, thus drawing us to continue in its place and development -and easier to from the efficiency so far gained.
            <br>&emsp;Taking this to be true we can assess what being great means and discern what qualities it proposes us to forever be. Foremost is that all of our good and joy will come from ourselves. As Emerson says, ‘if you are trying to reach somewhere better than yourself then you will proceed to no avail; the world is indifferent in what it offers, differing only in the one who makes use of it’. The agency required of us then is ever present so long as we wish to achieve the good from being ourselves. In many ways our problems are self determined and will thus follow us wherever we go; moreso, will our benefit not accrue unless our practical ability is harnessed and disposed -compared to stretching yourself beyond what you can hope to personally do. To remove disclarity we will say that being resourceful, opportune and promise seeking as well as gregarious and kind, are none the lesser when displayed by a man: know though that it is only right when he does it when he can: rather than surmounting himself and abandoning where he personally sits and lives, aiming somewhere otherwise with the hope of some outer gain. Herein we can have friends and family, circles and groups for thinking and creation, relations with and respect for the institutions and ways to grow around us, we can. “But we must realize that they are elements that surround the actor in his play.” Our lines spoken and our acts done are what determine the account of all those things and whether or not they are around someone who has integrity intrinsically. “Wherein they could rest amongst a man, rather than being fortunes of a fool or child.” In one way you could see how avoiding yourself to pursue those fortunes would see you more apt to acquire them: but they likely slip away. Not only in your interest as you cannot be pleased or settled, but they correspondingly drift away -for their attention and grace is ever required, going elsewhere in which it is contrary to obtain.
            <br>&emsp;It is true that you will not be the king of England if your ambitions are nestled between writing and green, but need you even be so? If our aim is to be happy, flourishing and free, regularly, then should our resolution and satiety set itself outside the frame of this achievement? If we have acquired this and are continuing to do so, where is the need to hunger for more: are you not full? I reckon the discontent of this scenario is that the good we find in being ourselves is rooted in prominence; in other words, the fruits of being great only come from being so, though, it is of a prominent kind that your stature sings -rather than a complete sculpture or mold. Being the artist and or creator, our lane is not finished when our piece is complete. And thank goodness for that: for it was the joy we earned in the making that which accurately and heavily reflects our soundly sought nature: and in that is where we must choose to proceed and respect, in how our ‘being’ continues to live.
            <br>&emsp;There is in short a great deal for us to do. However, there is very little in the way of achievement, or rather that there is at most a receding point of what is necessary to consider beyond ‘simply doing our best’. As I see it the way forward is one that reflects the path we will forever take; at home, with ourselves, we will step forth with strength and grandeur, but accuracy and constance to. Down this lane there is nothing that does not apply; be it in work or trade, love and riches or even pleasure and delight, all is fair. The difference though for this better day is that our judgment of these things and corresponding action, are rooted in and baked towards the roundest and fullest expression of ourselves: the results of which need not be concerned in whether not there is something more than purely being me. In that case we can attest to the simplest and finest effort within all those fields applicable to us. The specifics will follow but I generally will say that it is not the sort of action that measures our goods, rather that we do so with the resolve to be merely well and true; and in that case earn the reverence and cheerfulness that comes from being pleased with being just and great.
            <div class="qu"></div>love is in the air, though its scent is from the pie of reason nestled on the porch, wafting here promise and sweets into our sense of virtuous resolve and treatment
            I just can’t sit here and wait to feel like we’re going no where; somewhere though is not what we are trying to achieve. We are simply working to be great. If our horizon is strong and more aspiration is set to carry us away, then I say good on you. “Here though, the heart of us does not lie.” Greatness is marked within someone fully and truly composed forever in themselves and all that this can bring. The struggle though is that, again, as I have found before, there is no clear aim on what we ought to do. Presently, our situation positively compares in that before we were still set on acquisition whereas now we can plainly see that there is nowhere that we can truly achieve. Something to point out then is in regards to doing things that will make you more successful when it comes to regional flexibility and friendship, but are done so by taking proper steps -instead of stressing over how these gains will be made. This distinction is essential due to the fact that one may find that certain actions deserve less attention than others which seem otherwise pure; instead, we should accept the fact that our sincere aim of being ourselves determines how our involvement with things will go and, thus, merit all things so long as your core principles remain. In other words, it is not writing and study that deserve more focus than web design and production; rather, we should assess what remarks the strongest and integrated version of ourselves, and bring all things across the board to fit the line of that.
            <br>&emsp;Let us bring the motion front and forth. We are men and this means we are mortal. We may believe in a God, but this means not that there is a benevolent animal or robed figure who will set you off to a cloudy heaven on a golden steed. “Nor do we find any soundness in the belief that he can intervene -for is he not already all, stably.” Herein, are the likely consequences of our accurate portrayal of thee all being, is one that brings us to a place of seeing that it is irreverent and ill proposed to us. Our disposition though can be better stated as already being set, and is thus worthwhile to recognize and adhere, rather than develop. We are gregarious, thoughtful, industrious, creative, principled, patient and kind. It is through our assessment of these things and thus bringing them out in our active lives, that marks the proper lane and freedom in which we’d properly be. The question though is how this lens of definement incorporates the prominent fact of our familial and civil, laborious, leisurely, credited and artisanal lives? An example may further the notion. If we were a farmer in 1852, then our triumph through grace would likely reflect the strength and valor within our principled achievement; we sowed the grass and broke the bread with little to no complaints, a sense of gratitude and placement, and, overall, a genuine smile of cheer that respected the fact that although your time was in some ways dirty and tough, you were alive, able to watch the sunset and see the moon rise; moreover could you address the fact that this stream of merriment and aim, would simply end by the natural guarantee of what allowed for existence to occur in the first place. In other words, this man, as a mark of who we would better be, is strictly one who makes the best use of his time: for it is all that is given.
        </div>
        
        <div id="forthesame">
            I think perhaps in times of stress or sluggishness, it would be best to go over the primary proposal of your life. Foremost, we will die. Moreover, will rest be given: peace for eternity if you will. Furthermore, we can say that this being true reflects the fortune given to us: for we would otherwise not be able to live. We have, in effect, been propped up into a more intricate manner in which grace and treatment can be experienced, but this active state is principally temporary. We can still see our death as just though -and thereby appreciate our fortunes- as it is what the promise of life guarantees.
            <br>&emsp;As living things we are born and raised; moreso, we are descended from less complex things. It is therein reasonable to suggest that our development did not occur in the void of space, but rather it advanced in a fruitful environment of which a planet could only provide. Before our deaths (in terms of our inquiry) we could say that our place in this world is strictly set in being on one of them. It is possible to imagine interplanetary travel, or some stellar object which sat as our home, ‘but we will stand at least on one’. That we are stuck on the one we originated from is not our strict concern; rather, what we will do on the one that is given. We might say that a planet compares to a country then, in that it is simply some conditional set of lines that vary in what they practically profess. Being interplanetary then seems irrelevant when it comes to how we live and proceed.
            <br>&emsp;Building on that I think a distinction is worthwhile to make. If you take a flight, or a shuttle, to another location, this we will call travel by transport. “Even though you are present within the expedition, your home and place is changing.” The point I would draw then is that our regard for living be baked into the locale in which we end up. Put another way, our city and town, or neighborhood block, reflect the scenario in which our living takes place. Even if you travel regularly and abroad, it is in the place that you end up in that your foremost activity of living begins. Even if the act of travel brings you satisfaction, I would suggest that this be simply viewed as an experience between the points where the bulk of living takes place. For example, if you travel by boat or plane, this may take a day, or several even; but your time in the place that you end up is considerably longer. Unless you plan to move around more than you actually stay in place, then we will concern our acts of living within our local scenario. In that sense, be it on Mars, or in Zimbabwe, Kentucky or New Orleans, the case of our living is generally limited to where we go in a day. Moreso, if those points using vehicles merely bring you to brief points in which you return, then it is that home of yours that holds the primary stake -or the neighborhood at any rate. In that case, as I have found, our time is spent walking around, or inside with more creative kinds of living. Whereas the former aspect can define the active scope of our scenario, the latter reflects the actual time we spend generously, industriously and creating.
            <div class="qu"></div>Life seems so simple then, when the little thats required to account for stems primarily from me: and where would that ever fail to be?
        </div>
        <div id="pureprecedent">
            As I’d put it the sum of our lives is in determining what will happen and how we can prepare, or proceed rather. The latter encourages us to develop strength and accuracy so that our hopes may be in check and that our misfortunes can be fought through. When the former aspect is given too much emphasis though, we tend to aggrandize our interest in real-estate and travel -novelties and sparkling promises if you will. Better said, we get hankered down on wishes for and expectations of some desire. In effect then, we underestimate the amount of work required to achieve these, and overestimate how much free time and use we will upon success have. This is why accuracy is so important. However, the issue -and where the problem arrives- is when we make natural mistakes, of indulgence let’s say, our mind is stiffened; consequently the future, be it nearby or far away, is given too much precedent. “And resulting from this are awoken desires, or the introduction of new ones.” This is simply because if the outcome of things are considered paramount, then our anticipations will surely bend towards self importance and requirement. Apprehension, the inability to rest and the fear of missing out become the repercussion. Moreover, if you have made progress prior to this disheveled state, then these present feelings of grief and yearning will seize your capacities and morn you with distrust. For even though there are better times and steady groves near and on the road, so too does that intrusive state of pleasure and promiscuous excitement leave you feeling miserable and tarnished. “Which, itself,  is wholly tearing and equally distasteful.” 
            <div class="qu">Grim tales, as they say, come through to those who are afraid of the dark, for they have too much experience in avoiding their shadow; herein upon the prompt that he is returning with force, does your mind and gaze bolster itself from behind, as your attention peals back towards that bleeding feeling of rancor and dread -and all those gouging chimera’s that follow. “Such are the woes of inconstancy”</div>
            Principles defend us against these faulty propositions. More than that, they keep us tailored in our better time so that our steps are furthered in the right direction -and avoid falling back. This yields us the ability to more easily sit in times of depravity, as well as keeping us motivated and clear during prosperous times, ‘wherein our decisions are made for the benefit of its continuation’. If we are prevented from reaching this point of inflammation and distress, then we will avoid any recourse and recovery. Instead, we can proceed down the rightful path, earning both the encouragement and respect of the heartfelt justice in our steps, but a bountiful rejoice also as we reflect on what we have so far become. “And all of this too, while dining on the wholesome flavors that we actually have.”
            <br>&emsp;The tipping point is when deliberation and pledge marry you to the stake of this triumph’s continuation. “In that case, it is our life and its great and greenfull goodness that marks us, carries us, drives forward to an end, and does so cheerfully and without wounding efforts, to a point that is right and true and down a course that is worthwhile to agree upon and be faithfully led.” 
            <br>&emsp;The resolve then seems very simple. Sharpen your sword so that you may cut through the thicket and bramble, forging a path that can be both followed and personally enjoyed; as well, take the time to learn where there were any holes and traps, so that more can make the trip and you can proceed knowing how to better explore. In addition,  the knowledge of an infirmary should become familiar with your mind so that any scrapes and bruises don’t lead to permanent damage or disease. Even worse, we should seek the avoidance of a wrongful change in direction. In that case, we are best to affirm the strongest principles that earn us a great and lasting defense, as well as sculpting a mold of where we mean to go and seek to achieve. In this way our accuracy of deliberation and corresponding suitability for a genuine resolve will see that we can proceed through distraction and uncertainty. And with a pleasing certainty too! 
            <br>&emsp;I cannot promise that there is something on the other side; at most I can say that our end will not require or benefit those to cut down a path and travel.  Our lives seem ripe for this sort of being, in that our conquest was in the marching and advance, rather than taking steps with the aim of stopping.  ####Moreover, we could address the fact that the entire possibility of our adventure lie in some sort of wood. 
            <br>&emsp;Paths will be made with trails that follow; predators will stalk us, drawing us into injury or malicious ends; and to those fruits that we may find or the openings where more in front can be graciously seen, are still short of a permanent stay. “For if we stop, not the most on offer could otherwise prevent us from wishing we could proceed with nothing at all.” We are men, not objects. Those are what we look at and see. Moreso, they are what we as men subject them to. It is our industry and righteous passion that determines the boldness and fullness of heart, soul and mind. It is only in knowing this as true though that we will avoid the shambles of foolish and destructive varieties that those faculties potentially hold. 
            <br>&emsp;There are principles that prove this. Moreso, there is a great deal of strong evidence that bears comparable suggestion. Moreover, our very activity within these points of evidence -upon reflection and association- turn us towards the proper use of them. Herein, we can know that our presence as inquirers is smaller than the elements which our judgment holds. “Their place is at least more permanent than ours.” In effect, we can bank ourselves towards them as the things clearly worth our submission; and in that can the means which we employed to address them use similar faculties to better understand their meaning to us, and earn us a more rich and prosperous resolve -one of increased empirical accuracy to, for we gave an increased yet humble amount of care. “But rest easy, for that is all you’ll find -in your lasting mind- in this indebted reproach.””

        <div id="forgoodness">
            I am thinking that in order to take the truest step, we must know where it is we are trying to go. For some time this notion was saturated with active sentiments of ‘experience and joy’, whereas of late I’ve been thinking, with respect to our stake, that a reflective judgement could bear us a pass, ’where we were pleased to simply look back happily’. This would indeed be enough, and allow me to mortally proceed.  
            <br>&emsp;Specifically though, it is hard to say what to do. One of the reasons is that things generally do move with a natural tendency towards some end, and willing ourselves to some objective -rather than bending towards one rooted naturally within- is difficult, as our progress is banked outside of our own proclivity. You would think that who we are would cleanly manifest itself in whichever way was congenial to it. But the concern, is in our deliberation and care, and which end is in fact so; moreover, whether this characteristic (of being formative, or contrived) is truly worthwhile to resolve to?
            <br>&emsp;I think there is an answer. Perhaps it is the case that through our civil development, those well off have lost the judge, which for all of time drew out our nature. As before we were put to the test, to run and hide, commune and gather, but now were at best stressed by the characterized hoarding. “Literally, or in food for example, what a fortune!” Nihilism, Existentialism, Theological debate or simple determinism (by virtue of physics), seem to be fair as the response within this neutered state -when there is no trouble left. I believe this is wrong though. For one, this attempt to live outside of our inner nature is a struggle, for the ends of those claims are as incomplete as the ones in these leveled times. In other words, our attempt to proceed is fabricated on the basis of our fortunes smoothing the way; the concept though defines this as irregular and vain on the pure fact that these intentions are built up, rather than ingrained. That is why we all feel so much trouble despite the fact that there is an abundance of goodness and fortune around us. This in many ways shows us the fact that our living is the front measure, rather than those things around.
            <br>&emsp;In a thinner state our tendency is to look towards outward things, rather than find alignment to ourselves. It is as if we are cleaning fish who have lost their host and have no sense of what to otherwise do; consequently, they flutter about in search of some other whale or shark, and are unhappy and restless until they find a candidate. That latter notion reflects the fact that one’s nature is in effect calibrated to proceed into the world in a way in which those outward things fall in line with it. What I see happening though is that when the prominence of those inner tendencies are removed -by virtue of modern civilization- then the mark for its expression is shortened, wherein the effect is that it has less congruency to be produced, in that it has less that it is meant to do. The issue though is that the core of these ordinances remain: they have simply been relaxed and flattened. “Like muscles which have had nothing to lift, but the fibers remain.”
            <br>&emsp;The response is generally to find outward things that are enticing enough or rightfully substantial in as much as they draw us forward to meet them and interact. On the prior point though, this merely reflects the fact that (seeing as our nature, or one at least is present -regardless of stature or state) some action is needed. To be clear this is fair; considering our root of living, it makes sense that in absence of personal care or demand that some recreational or(for example) divine purpose will be sought so that an expression can be made. This seems legitimate. The thing is, that on one end I suspect that our inner nature is better prepped to deal us a riper existence, while on the other, or in addition at least, I am skeptical, and in many ways critical and cynical, that outer ventures will be enough. Perhaps it all comes down to education. The need for maturity and strength is, for the sake of our tale, lost and forgotten amidst our industrial fortunes. Interestingly though, and to my point, that even though we are warm and safe, we all still wish to, and evidently do, live. The action though that generally follows is somewhat small and hollow in my estimate; moreso, do those who admittedly live more vast and impactful lives, still fail to meet anything that is truly lasting and sound -in other words, the vain attempts and rewards of entrepreneurial and political success.
            <br>&emsp;Here though, we have an answer. To preface, it must be disclosed that this proposal is rooted in my own personal attentions; better said, in my own fortunes have I diligently addressed the fact that without living I am tired and frail, and that within my otherwise attempts I am short and unfulfilled. What then do I mean to say? What I seek to explain is that by paying attention to one’s self, prompted by the honest assessment that those factors of proper living are poorly met, encourages and directs one to well founded living. As we have stated, being fortunate alongside others around you, yields you less outward guidance or personal motivation to inwardly succeed. “In that way, those issues of idleness and vanity lay.” If we notice this, and assent to the fact that living is in fact our only gain, then we can consider the underlying nature that relishes in being so active, and henceforth resolve to bring that out so that our agency is measured by and settled towards a fuller and lasting expression. In many ways, the proposal here is rooted within the suggestion of being wise. “Notice your need to act, and evaluate whether a reflected happiness and proceeding joy will result from worldly ambitions and childish aims? Be honest about this and ordain yourself to the path in which the answer shows. Only here will something truly promising and profitable grow.”
            <div class="qu">And oh how ripe it is; yet ignorance that this freshness and play is the real stake, will see our otherwise ambitions and dreams wither us away</div>
            Considering that wisdom then, how should we ultimately proceed? Well, for one, if we are clear on the fact that our inner nature needs to be upended and instated as the base of our action, then we must make the hardest distinction between necessary development and just expression. Seeing as we are looking inwards, or back let’s say, on the basis that what lies in front is unappealing, then our resolve to go back to the space where our reflections see, is effectively one of suspense and regress. This is simply the humble task for one who wishes to reorient and therein proceed further and prospectively. An old quote then seems appropriate. “Some, when climbing a mountain, come to the end of their current path. They can in some cases see higher, but the trail is blocked ahead. There are two choices: one, you stay there with complacency or complaints, or two, you make that inspection of possible routes below, and genuinely respect the offer it holds and accordingly act. In this way, you will have to go back down; moreso, will the new path ahead likely require new kinds of skill and development. It is only a man though, or one who is mature, who not only sees this and its value, but amends themselves to make the struggle, the heart of which is not in the effort, rather in the humility of recalibration, wherein they follow the patience and care required to bring out those corresponding ends. To that, we all have a mountain to climb. Though, it is those who are best at climbing that will earn the most all the way, as their abilities come from the constancy of use, the soul of which is given by their constant respect for the medium in which their skills exist. Consequently, the varying nature of the mountain delivers the law for the climber: and out of gracious respect, he resolves himself to this way happily, as if it were fertile and just.”
            <br>&emsp;This parable has a limit though. Whereas a mountain is arranged under comparable routes and terrain, the life and intent of one living well is fundamentally different than those who are idle or seeking ambition. At its core, those who are still are not living, and their account, by virtue of being ones like us with the need for expression, will be considered as temporarily out of the game. “And their regard will at most be suspended under the notion that their involvement in the other two will at some point happen.” Regarding ambitions, or vanity, these are ultimately unpromising. Foremost, to clearly reiterate, is that their hope is within acquisition, the root of which comes from a thinned nature looking to express itself, but ultimately finding, upon success, an imperative need to continue doing more. Consequently, the main critique of these sort of aims is that upon their end, they strictly need more: and how is that in anyway fulfilling? Take that to be the case for outward living, more or less.
            <br>&emsp;Regarding that reroute towards the inner path, this one, aside from the reflection and resolve to bring out its ability in action, has different formats and interests with respect to how they (being full natured) wish to live. In their case, the hope is not within fame, gold or position; rather, the abundance that they seek is in how they actually live. In this way, their path is littered with activities such as writing and study, personal training and diligence, friendship within men of old or creative moderns, and altogether a slew of things which draw their aim of living -and marry them proudly to a stake that allows for their treatment and participation. The difference is clear to me. While those of outward intent earn their satisfaction through progress and dreams, these ones of living gain their wealth from actual involvement with the activities on hand; moreso, do they embellish upon these and increase their fruitfulness by paying time and attention to the subjects and topics of interest, refining their deliberative intent and creative means, and overall solidifying their reverence for the path of leisure and craft at hand.
            <br>&emsp;In short, the man of living forges himself to be so. By the graces of his fortuned time, he respects the fact that being free is not equal to living; this consequently drives him to solidify and protect the prominence of what that life of activity fully means. Corresponding with that, as follows, is a loving care for what others have done and a generous approach to being similarly expressive and productive; moreso, he takes notes on the fact regarding who is offering and what they provide, so that his grace and settlement on the present abundance can take a lasting hold, along with proposing himself to the end of this lane and its flavor of living -by the greatest sorts of expression and tribute that he is able to and means to give. “I am not sure there is enough virtue, reason or point in the contrasting path of ambition, that would allow for or invite such colorfulness in respectively describing their intent?”
            <br>&emsp;I will say one last thing, in closing. Even though action seems necessary for anyone with a nature, and although our need for survival and stabilizing effort is fortunately no longer needed, our place as ones in these privileged times is still baked with the fact that our nature remains. Even though the demands and subsequent tradition of maturity and strength increasingly wain, the lower prominence of our ability and care to live removes no amount of worth or claim that is found through riper and well founded living. In a way though, our truest account and interest to live remains a servant to the nature of those who are living. Forgo the nature of a rock for one second; we are trying to attest to the constancy and success of one who has more willfulness and animation, the nature’s of which we describe as living. Regarding those with this ordinance of an expressive need for the according life, is still surmounted and operative to the field of the limits of living. In that way, even if our natures are abundantly freeing and flourished, there is only a short amount where this can be so; for even though during our time when we can address the fact of living and resolve ourselves to be so, as I have found at least, you still feel as though your dancing into none. Let it be known though, for it personally comforts me, that similar to that rest I enjoy during and between our days of living, that having some that is even more free and lasting after all our time is done, is no bother or nail in me.
        </div>
        <div id="truemovement">
            Over my years, I have gathered a great deal of inner peace and satiety from permitting my aims and actions to be enjoyable and promising in and of themselves. This did not always offer much besides our pleasant time, nor was it always accepted, or understood at any rate; but the ease and benefit from doing so has definitely outgrown those shortcomings.
            <br>&emsp;One result of this has been the sentiment of horizontal and vertical movement. The former reflects the change from ambition, wherein a position or possession is gained, while the latter marks the reach of one in their actual living. What this amounts to is a fair disregard for our change of fortune or equity, but instead a vehement and just ascendance to a place in which we see the world and treat it, in and wherever we are, no matter where we’re at. For instance, some may wish to travel to far off and exotic places, be it for the excitement of going somewhere or the novel interests that promise their delight, while others may simply enjoy what they have (and are privy too) where their currently at, whereby the passing sun and moon, the birds humming, the clouds drifting away, all the colors and other norms of our common place, are both enough and, in a way, wholesomely pleasing, ‘for we went to no place far off -with its according expense- to see and be pleased, but rather we helmed ourselves to be so upright and keen for those splendors outside our door’. Which, itself, is something both admirable in its simplicity and reliable in that the only limit is us and our ability to gaze ever higher. “As opposed to fortune, who grants us only steps from side to side.”
            <div class="qu">My constitution is best when it is so well founded and composed, that a reverent tribute to all that draws us and the leading profit of treatment and joy are gained, is readily and forever established and done, no matter the place, whenever the time, in whichever the house, country or norm: we are already made, we are in all places the same, but it is our true and aligned posture to this always present way, that reflects the solidity of one rooted in such a way that the goods of this greatness are simply and widely achieved</div>
            Being who we are, so malleable that is, I feel like our particular aspects within the genre of human, must be thought on and designed. Otherwise, our more primitive and innate features will become embellished and our natural tendency will grow towards indulgence and ignorant gain. We are set for any and all, and those that truly treat us to the most require even more attention and care to become fully disposed to and engrained. “Again, as said, it is only the easiest and immediate to become entrenched in sulking pleasures and foolish ambitions . To conduct ourselves in a way that earns an inner respect along with the sense of being pleased (with oneself), is not so simple or ready to acquire. There, we must actually think on and define the world through the measure of the accomplishments we genuinely wish to find, for even if we were the King of all, able to forever and in any place be, so would those fruits of activity and expression require nothing more than even the poorest man had. “And such alignment and respect limits us only by our regard.”
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, reason is our friend here as is consistency and grace. Done so regularly and we will be treated to the utmost gift that comes from attention and care; that is, a frequent set of joy and flourishing, as well as the promise and stability found through valid and solid prospering. Doing so, to reiterate, cannot be so half hazardly or passively achieve -nor with any naivety of whats required, or the misguidance of thinking that fortune is what such activity is for. “For the aim of generous deliberation that we seek, can only give us the claim we wish for through an equally bound set of similarly thoughtful action.”

        <div id="dearways">
            I will die. This I cannot prove or claim to be explicitly true; but I believe it to be a sound position. “That it will happen at least.” This limit is placed on me justly though, for my time spent at this point is filled with appreciation and joy. And until that day where I end in hope without sorrow, I will live, as if my time was briefly spent being prior to a lasting rest. Though, there is much that can go wrong amidst these active portions of our days, as we may find ourselves stiff and idle, or full of toil and unease. My solution to this is to ingratiate ourselves into the path of righteousness and freedom: if chosen otherwise then discontent will naturally propel you back to the former state. The resolve though, should be one where that proper way forms into something regularly acted upon, whereby the stance of it is constant and upright, whilst letting you bring it out and act upon it -in which the greatest living is gained.
            <br>&emsp;There is a state of goodness that is not only known to me, wherein it settles not only deeply but expressively, but inscribes itself into the world in the most abundant of ways. The picture that it paints is not only vivid and kind, but full of grip and matter; consequently, I not only see but am part of this rich portrayal of the world around me. “What is shown and born from this creator, is where I mean to go.” Put another way, I enjoy what our best self has to offer; not only in the production that it makes, but the clarity that it offers -and the deliberation that fittingly follows. When I am with this man there are wants and needs that beautifully measure up to the richness of the world; when I am touched with such slivers of profit and joy, I can color more, as my palette is not only cleansed from drowning shades, but full of applicable vibrance and hues -which bears the colorful employment of my mind. In this illustration the horrors of the world are but mere stains on an otherwise gifted tapestry; moreso, the goods and green of it all are not limited to hope and pungent hues, but full of deep wonders that reminisce of rainbow scarlet. “Of a whole which is varied with silky joy.” 
            <br>&emsp;My nature is one where this portrait is made, but it is not enough to simply know this:  I must see it. And no wonder, as my heart becomes full of grit and slate when I meagerly stand, thinly noticing the whole of entirety, ‘whose passing glances offer nothing more than scorn and flame’. It is only when my sight is active, as if the breadth of that portrait is more than a garnish but the combined parts of nature herself; whereby I take her hand, tenderly, smiling, and see her sides glistening in welcomed red, vehement orange, pearl yellow, humble blue, sufficient gray and, foremost and to my place as one so small, ‘that glowing grain of green and harmony’. 
            <div class="qu">The latter stitch is where my heart is fit and sown -and all the rest graciously follow</div>
            For many years I had the simple aim of living well, but was imposed upon to have an objective within it. In part this was sound, for that well being and its active elements required a place to work from. The issue though was that I could not find any interest or conception about the means to do these things ‘when it was the simple act of existing that proved enough to do them in abundance’. In that case, I matured and was humbled. Though, this did not result in those truer joys being more embellished; rather, I let them drift gently to the side whereby I sought for them when I could, but responsibly tended to my post with the appreciative knowledge that they were there besides us: our role though had become the primary factor. As I grew I realized that the issue was in the thinness of those joyous aims. What I saw was that they had no form and width in themselves and were therein being shunted by the obligations surrounding them. Now, I realize that beyond being more firmly set, these goals of generous craft are not meant to acquire me anything more than being active in them. There is promise admittedly, but this is not a concern, but rather a suggestion of how the proficiency in these wholesome efforts will provide me with the room and means to do them more and better. ”All that is required though, is in me, as the tailor, and the object of my efforts, the mark of my craft, needs itself an aim and commitment: the resolve of which has made me happier than I’ve ever been before.”
            <br>&emsp;As it stands, there are two principles I’ve discovered regarding this notion -of mere creative ambition. Firstly, is that monetary (or professional, in other words) ambition cannot yield any sort of well-being.  Simply, the asset being developed will not in any short amount of time allow the maker to forgo maintenance, and that even if the time of the person is eventually given free, the skill of appreciation and heart of gratitude will not have been given ample time to grow -for those achievements which gave you an actual (or wholesome at least) reward. On the former, the time offered as a response to the asset’s success will be less viable for use because the product continuously demands support, along with encouraging further development -prolonging the fill of your time. On the latter, the joys and wonder gifted to one who has the freedom to see them, will not be optimally known -or cultivated rather- as their sight was not the mark of achievement. “And by such outwardly ambitions, our creative ones are accordingly familiar and in tune.”
            <div class="qu">Its as if we reached a point where we could have all the food in the world but our palette was untrained, as well as being stained from the time until then, when during the ambitious progression indulgence and sweat were all that we tasted: and how can we now be as well nourished, satisfied or sustained through these purer goods which are now on offer? I’d venture that the results we are treated to are those that reflect the ends which our position is rooted in: those grasping ambitions</div>
            The second principle demonstrates the limit of fortune. To preface, the friction in our lives prevents us from fully investing our time in the fullest abundance. Fortune, describes the privilege earned through relations and family, the patronage of institutions or government, the luck of choices and investment, and the promise of formative and congruent action -or the simplicity that comes from being well tempered and formed.  In total (or on their own), these level out the path of all moving forward. They remove the holes in the ground and smooth the road ahead. A driver is not made though, nor is he given a friend. The principle in question reflects the genuine desires of those generous, rationale and kind, and how the reach of their expression within these is only acquired through being thoughtful, objective and deliberate. “Fortune merely gives us the time and ease to do so, wherein the route ahead had only the regard for joyous achievement -rather than some further position.” The principle though, marks the fact that even if you were king, omnipotent and immortal, that living would still be required for the foremost measure to be acquired -of living that is. And seeing as this result only comes through action, tribute and participation, our strongest effort demands not only that we are stout and able as to allow such expression, but also that we figure out what draws such treatment: both so we have a mold to contribute towards, but therein a draw that earns us those riches of being thrown in -or invested rather and engaged. In other words, the limit of a crown is that it does not necessarily procure the interest or skill in meeting those heartiest of claims. And interestingly enough, if the man in charge did in fact surrender his intent to those things which would actually make him happy, then the position he was in would become less crucial (in his wants), and perhaps a burden, as his time held more worth in raising the solidity of his aims and self.
            <div class="qu">For they are what pull him along, nor is flat footedness or a dull mind welcomed even in the courts of monarchial ambition</div>
        </div>
        <div id="forall">
            There is so much good in this world that an error on my part has been made. We came from a green part of the wood, but were not shaped to hold it all in; perhaps if we had, then the winds and weather ahead would have seen us more rooted in: it simply blew us over. I wish I had known though that the trees were not our object of final interest. As time has gone on I have realized that it is the fruit it produces, the views from the canopy, the home for me and friends. "Each and all being worth our time to deepen the trunk." Moreso, to note, does the base of it allow us to venture around. If it is into the nearby meadows and glades then to this we can be most grateful; and if it is through brambles and mud then we can surely feel the same, though in this case fortuned that our trouble will not burn us permanently, or at the least keep us forever low and the same.
            <br>&emsp;I live in Kamloops now, or should I say the dry snow den. It may not be soon but clear skies of early blue and evening red will consistently come; moreover will the flats and hills around open up for us to rest and gaze at these sights. From a studious point I am encouraged to learn about these elements and what their schedule is, along with the cogs that shuttle them to come and go as they are set to forever be. The reason for this refers to our limited grasp on the world and the rush that we have to see it whenever we feel our hands beginning to slip. The idea can be fully expressed in the following way. I quote, "In a VR experience, there was a flight through the deserts of Nambia; all these hills and dunes of burnt orange sand and the yellow shine of the sun glazing it uniformly, serene. What I noticed though is that within this immersive view -from a helicopter mind you- the world was not so vast or grand in any way; the horizon surely kept some timely secrets as well as the color and grit of the local sand, but it was for itself in this locale, and thus to those present, this was their only own."
            <br>&emsp;The point I'd make is whether or not those who own much more have the time or interest to see it? Moreover, is there any significant sort of you who actually have such scope in your lives, or even the means to keep it(in regards to momentary travel). From the ground up it seems like our place is set locally or, per our limit, will settle into one that reflects the same. This latter notion is worth clarifying. You may expect that fortune's offer to travel is worthwhile and thus the corresponding effort demanded is just; mark that fact though that it will in no short of time ease itself into a home and place that is similar to the one that you left. "Know this before going anywhere, that each and all is the same."
            <br>&emsp;To end I would say that the other interesting fact is that each of these locales, be it set in or arriving to, are really worthwhile and unique because of the variations they possess: the mold is ubiquitous though. Those deserts are only foreign to those who have not been there yet. If you were there then the joy would be in seeing the areas and time that the sun set, the in and outs of the walls of sand along with the ever going view of the dunes expanse: as the good, it is merely one of this specific area, and is thus the good which is familiar to those present. "Flavors will vary, as will our ability to taste, but the heart of food, or there being good in the matter, will equal out no matter the place: for all it means is what we see, and no spot holds more or less possibility."
            <br>&emsp;The conclusion rests then on the realization that where we are at has the same possible interests and marks of appreciation as any place that you may wish to go; yearning to do so then is simply more trivial due to the eventual adjustment you'd make, and futile if you wish to move some more. Bringing ourselves to respect and stair at our current points will allow for the gifts of genuine fortune to materialize themselves more fully: for in this state of grace will your present living see improvements, therein affording you the chances and time to go where the variety's of something genuinely draw you. You can go there without prior unsettlement though; for you know that your sitting point will at heart be the same, and structurally similar as well. All that means is that to each and every thing, are there equal claims of good to see: for the means to doing so is strictly onto our grace and vision, of which has no opportune place that permits its better use, or at all. "We bring out the world the same: and vanity is thinking some will bare a better offer, rather than you being the one who realizes the gain."
        </div>
        <div id="particulars">
            If the good is found in proper activity, how can we better understand what particular elements or ideas are sound? For one, we can consider that the value baked into that goodness is one of robustness, evenness, regularity and care. Regarding that, an action or movement is only fair if it is of the sort and kind with respect to those requirements. For example, drinking overly will cause you to sweat and falter, leaving you with little attentive possibility ahead, nor reflective ability; as well, does the miscarriage of these choices leave you outside the lane of what is true and normal; in that, you will need to re-regulate yourself to that proper way, therefore entailing that the current path is wrong -for it would otherwise not have to be changed. What about exercise though, we ought to take part in some of those? Well, let us not define things so limitedly; we may as well equate civil rights studies with those of engineering; moreso, for each let's say, would the ends differing -for vain or just reasons to name some- alter the sort of movement that you were doing. And so, of things that we are doing, we may do them in a different way, changing by the results we find. This is why vain actions are poor because the opposing route that is truly rich will have to be amended to later. "Whichever path demanded you change direction is not a good one then." Of the kind of action, be it of this training or that employment, is similarly valued as good when the heart of the motions involved produce the profits of living. "Being a doctor is not bad, but if the aim of it and resolve was thoughtlessly formed and set for dreams and ambition, then the reward of being generously involved will not be proficiently sought; herein, a comparable direction will need to be changed, as well as leaving you worse off and empty upon the fruition of this frailish end."
            <br>&emsp;Forewardly then, would I say that our scale for assessing things is bound through the results that are truly offered, and whether or not the path to these can be continually sought. The former to me is rooted within joy and the corresponding need for private thinking and development, along with the suitability for acquiring true and genuine friendship. In effect, we may know where to go that will yield us the environment and task that we can abundantly throw ourselves into, and, additionally, attract others who are admirably the same, and therein be set for a properly just team of acquaintances -or a simple friend. Considering who you wish to be in this regard and what elements are most appropriate for this portrait of yourself to become most realized, is fundamentally required. For if we don't, even if our view was to joy, we would have less clarity onto what would provide this, and consequently see you acting relatively astray. That is why our ends must be thought of; for if we are doctors without any regard for the relevant activities(near and later) when it comes to living, then we will not sufficiently reach them, in both presence or appreciation. Moreso, if the activities that we reach bar us from proceeding, then we are only moving further away from that most desirable point and all its accompanying means for lasting participation and activity.
            <br>&emsp;Let me just say what this form of thinking amounts to on my own end. At the front we have our industry's effort being applied to formatting a journal and sharpening its offerings. This, marks the greatest version of myself, both in terms of what I have done and am in need to improve, along with what will bring me the most forth, and so in the soundest way. Right beneath this are a slew of private and objective interests. These are a mix of A) things that I wish to be more clear on for clarity and benefits sake, and B) those which require an outline and solidifying of terms and ideas, so that the topics and interests can be subject to later industry and formative care. These efforts are not concerned with outlook and appeal; rather they are there to personally suit me, or become viable for that great front of treatment. "I have distinguished these kinds of works so that those proper for rigorous attention have the appropriate amount of time, whilst those in a more cultivating state are neither draining on me with expectations to be treated better, as well as getting the actual objective and preliminary work done -because we are free from ambitious pressures and guarantees." In that case, these private interests are proficiently bold when it comes to the second rule of 'active consideration'. The former to be clear, that is our industry, does oblige the considerate thought of what is appropriate and fitting within that class(of rigor and display), only the foremost rule of 'aims suitable for constancy is also given prevalence and attention. In that case, we are set only on producing what we can, and sharing it for the sake of teaching, composure(from sharing and its confiding benefit), and the utmost increase of our accountability and vested interest. At least, to me, will the aim of this be met fully through sharpening what we have through a suitably portraited and fertile display, and congruently offering the goods from this production onto appropriate platforms such as LinkedIn, Medium, in a sort of way on Twitter, and other writing platforms that share the worth of bound through the heart of our thinking. To that the rule is followed.
        </div>
        <div id="ourline">
            The promise of success and the certainty of how it will be acquired is not truly reminiscent of what I even seek. My wish is to invest more and earn more through activities, be it of an artisan style of craft, or in my business of work and labor -of a good kind that is. Moreover does the requirement of these to be furthered call on a friendship, particularly a friend; the former is found through any and all when similarities are revolved around and triumph or defeat has a comparable cause; the latter though marks one who has these features but lives nearby, close enough that letters and voice chat were not the extent to which our friendship flourished. We need someone we can not only actively but regularly and intimately co-operate on and develop; this means our training, leisure, eating and rest is not done alone with separate interactions between; rather me and my friend (s) are staked around those aspects together, wherein the cultivation and aim of our friendship has more robust and concurrent attention. "That would give much ground around me, as opposed to their being friendly lands nearby."
            <br>&emsp;In addition, it is worth it to add how these friends can be acquired. Generally, there are two suitable ways. One is that you show people at home, that you know or some colleague or possible peer/friend, the work that you have done and mean to do; this is what gives our website so much local appeal. Moreso then, if this can occur and more work can develop -which our private efforts follow - then that expression opens up possibilities for people who are regionally close to become your acquaintance. This case is worth reflecting on. Most people are suitable for living well and creation of some kind; circumstances will likely bring any group together, though not each of its members will be so prominent. Anyone can help and aid you in furthering the scope of your expression, but it is from there that those more prominent and bound can hear what you proclaim, and more reasonably travel and associate. This is why internet friends or people that you meet from afar -who have few possibilities in forming relationships- are not so worthwhile when it comes to our most basic and forming expression.
            <br>&emsp;The point is that our place from the ground up is not aimed at acquiring something, or desiring things that are outside of our reasonable capability; moreover, are we not going to fidget or fret over efficiencies that we could employ with the aim of leveraging our sounder actions: for truest efforts, at even a minor scale, will earn a suitable reward. What we seek is to have more discussions, review movies and play more games. Moreso, do I seek to do this with other people. "It is those by my side though, who are close enough that we could share our gaze up towards the stars, that this cooperative creativity reaches the highest place. Otherwise, you are only part of my community -while the formers are my wholehearted friends."
            <br>&emsp;Moving forward then, I will proceed till someone stops me; if they do I will not be bothered for my understanding was never placed on A) this never happening, and B) that the result of continuing was necessary. Prevention, obligations, doubts and unambition are no trouble for one who wishes to be consistently generous and kind. It is true that these mark a flourishing state of me and that being stuck in a hole would not be preferable; favorable results though are in most ways outside fortune's control: for what will happen is what is likely, and this is for the most part out of my control. It is foolish to think that the things which would impede you are those which are uncommon and unnatural; these are not worth accommodating as their place is unknown and hard to prepare. When it comes to sickness, the demands of labor and the toils of mistakes that cause a stiff body and restless mind, these can be addressed and taken on in preparation; we know they will in whichever way happen, and thus are not worthwhile to avoid. Per our resolution, would becoming more apt and able in all of these situations be the most advantageous; knowing what will happen is worth considering beforehand so it is never a shock and deemed unfair, and to all those which will occur upon recklessness and poor self control not be so, if your time and attention is honed towards supporting more worthwhile values and things: the claim of which is forever, and equally just in staking our growth. "For it grants us increasing amounts of ease and capability."
            <br>&emsp;Our line is forever; moreso is our ability to acquire limited by the principle of allocation. Moreover, would achieving such wealthy ends serve us nothing more than the interest to do as we would now; or, in short, that no matter the width or smoothness of the road, or the vehicle in which we were set in, would not make us either a good and appreciative driver, or give us a friend -who would make the trip more significant and bearable. "Instead of worrying about the net we have and how the fish will swim in it, let us trust our grip and knowledge that 'if there are fish and our deployment is well placed', then our hopes can at least seem fair and happy by the effort we made and the fact that it was best placed - therein giving us enough."
            <br>&emsp;In practice, our ambitions should focus on what will be seen as opposed to whether or how it will be or not. That space is too crowded and ill suited for our resolve and action; our bet is in the work that gathers the time, pleasure, ease and attention by me and those yearning to live well. Doing so then is much more promising within the hopes more reasonable to what's common. What reassures me is that our expectations of grandeur and success have had very little stay in both our personal hopes and interests, as well as what we have familialy conveyed. "If I were set and settled by those rules of choice, privilege, patronage or congruence, then we could barrel forth in the most consistent and gentle ways, making forth through and by the production of things that reflect our innermost draw, and bending ourselves to the mere satisfaction that this is our sought for existence." Perhaps the heart of our roominess and discontent is in the realities of our world and its struggle, and the then present wish to remove it so more time and effort can be spent as we genuinely please. The hopes that rise above this are the most pernicious to me; they drive you out of your home and place, seeing more sparkly and possible ventures inside business and international appeal. The mark of this is in a poor outlook on the world. Here, we think others really care, or are there and pledged to be looking. "Everyone returns home, where those foremost works are done. My place is one where, be it by friends or outward companions, we start from this central place, bringing ourself out through the very mark of our production. Nothing more could ever wished to be accomplished. And if we gain the ability and fortune to do more, then we will know that it was from a spot that was set for more of the same, and ill favoured to foolish wishes besides and above."
            <div class="qu">As my heart is telling me, would something close and nearby be enough. And as an increased point of density, is it an improvment over a lighter yet boread scope of many folks around. "It is just so hard to settle into the ultimate truth, that the former notin reeally falls on you, to at least be a friend of your own -for that is the heart of being local, in which you could then host a friend."</div>
            Now, my choices can bury us in our current scenario(or any for that matter). We must distinguish though the state of our work and its production and whether or not it is in the midst of revealing yourself to a friend, or if it is in a state where its impression and or fruition is on the edge of being seen. We are not there though. We may never be. It is possible that life continues to offer and task, and we innerly work by our own standing forever through the days. Like most of our time and what we could expect it to be, will we be merely looking up then, hoping for nothing more than to continue our place in this environment, by ourself or not. In that case, it is our desire and respect to watch the sun and moon, and beholden ourselves to the short and long term positions and accommodations that allow us to better anticipate and expect their happening. In other words, of all that there is good and green in the world, there are two things that bolt us properly to floor: the admiration of those alike who similarly revere and delight in the greatness that is uniformly on display, followed and aside the balance and composure to maintain and relish the aim of this offer, 'continuing to trust that the active state required to engrain the anticipation and trust of it happening, is simply and freely enough for me, and thus a marked measure of a friend greatly compared to me'.
            <br>&emsp;This question is worthwhile in going over, briefly at least. That is the distinction between our work and ambition, and our personal lives. In other words, what life will we have that is common and everyday regardless if we run businesses, countries or an impression. The truth is that friends, lifestyle and family are likely unchanged by even the strongest of fortunes. My feeling though is that there is some friction in considering the more genuine approach of 'living more' wherein we respect the fact that A) it earns the highest measure, and B) that other pursuits yield nothing more, effectively. Perhaps it is our troubled time that sees me fending of uncertainty and aspiration, and being less composed and settled into a way which is true and fitting. In some ways I believe we are still trying to make our world easier and approachable, differing only in how it is applied. "This does not seem necessary for personal action." I seek to work on things and invest my time and attention; how this varies is whether or not we are on our own or with other people. The measurable difference in what is appropriate to do is with respect to what is sought; this may come from foresight and ease of accomplishment, or be simply rooted into the limits of how much a certain amount of interest can produce. For example, if there were 100 of us then our hopes and ambitions would be large and substantial. With just me I seek writing, reflection, formation and treatment. In addition, with friends, does gaming, reviews and discussion likely follow. 'That is fine when I am set and happy in me."
            <br>&emsp;I would expand on this through a past point that being famous or successful (digitally let's say) would only allow you to do those personal things in a grander way. My feeling is that these inner treatments are being held back by the concern of what forgoing that infamy brings -with respect to newer efforts. Per our decisions I'd say that nothing more than true and genuine effort is of interest to me: everything past is born from self aggrandizement and importance, along with fear of missing out and or what we could otherwise achieve. Building on that prior point, will internet fame not yield you a friend. What we are best to do is earn more and be more through our genuine works and writing. Having friends will allow the formats of these to be more varied and abundant. The effect though is that if we become more prominent and impressive on the whole, then it is of what we are doing that more favorably earns attention. "In short, we want people to see our Sums so that more effort and interest can go in; people caring furthers my own value of it, which either sets me forward towards higher personal efforts, or ones that are equally larger but collaborative."
            <br>&emsp;This is crucial and worth addressing. The model works in the following way. Earn local trust and comradery so that more genuine efforts can be made; as firm as we are to this line will more abundance be produced, efficiently too, and thus an overall impression will be made. 'To Gondor We Go!' I say, in that we are preciously and vehemently striving along the lines of the effort and construction that I have made, and wish to expand upon and further cherish and say. This is solely in our control. Practically, if the reward that we seek comes from the impression of things that we are doing and wish to increasingly do, and the means to drawing this in is through more strong and sound abundance, then the goal of our deliberation and the path that marks the righteous way down our innermost road, is through comradery, friendship and personal acquaintances. Specifically, foreign folks may invest, but they be unable to initially build; for that we need a partner and friend (for strict and consistent sake). How this is achieved is marked within the lanes within our personal lives. People are met at work, at home, with nostalgia or remaining relations; with more benefit are those who you meet at more intimate and useful initiatives ie. workshops, classes, and internet use that reflects regional limits (to name a few). And in that case our best is in having something to bring. For one, will our closest influences give you the time, agreement, wilfulness and or support to continue developing and inquiring from the ground up; this paired with the prominence that we'd display in any of those outer events feels like the right path -where our promise comes from the influence placed upon others through our strongest propriety.

        <div id="whocares">
            Not only is it clear that there are people who are worse off than me, and that my own issues are hardly easy enough to come by as it is, but the world does not care. There is a mountain of infrastructure with all these uniquely tailored cogs, and no one is there to emphasize you. I feel that this is applicable in one's impact, in that only those who can muster the time and care to listen will do so, and moreover, will their spread of what they enjoyed only reach those who are interested in hearing from them. In short, everyone is doing something; moreso is there much less you could hope to achieve that was actually crucial for them. At best, your own inner activity could inspire others to do the same; if one's mind is set outward though, then the issue they've made is thinking that anyone other than those who have similarly errored, cared. There is just too much natural and demanding misfortunes to soundly believe that anyone really cares; that is why friendship is the finest, for someone can share what you wish to avoid and achieve.
            <br>&emsp;Another fact is that people in their younger years get sheltered from the world, forming views from their place within youthful institutions and relationships. The ordinance of this may lead itself well into the real world, but they are merely better at demonstrating themselves. The issue, for better or for worse, is that they don't acknowledge the inevitable wares of their living; as well, they still don't see how indifferent the world is, which contrasts their experience in those earlier ages. Still, they may do well in an artistic or skillful sense, but the value is only in the thing they're doing, rather than the impressions that they've made. "There is simply too much that goes on for everyone with a change of disposition(into maturity) that follows. That is why people don't rave when they're fifty: it runs contrary to their lives."
            <br>&emsp;The crux of this is that the world demands so much from you, both in order to basically stand, and forthright see. Because this is universal, it is not sound to think that anyone is any more than distantly observing(and possibly interested). Vanity should be removed, or devalued at least. We can make moves that are seen, or at least are done so in a more integral way that gives more developing chances that an impression will be made. First, we do our own best, wherein we live the most and form it well together; secondly, is you find someone who is also trying to live well, and therein is eligible to collaborate; in effect, the output of both of you will genuinely be that much more. Why this is good is that a friend is subject to the world in a comparable way. Because our resolve to this is one that is at most suspending over the draining whole of nature and her way, we can say that the very ability to share interests with one is lucky. Compared to kids who have groups and many friends, people amidst mature responsibilities and corresponding desires are outside any place where such sheltered comradery can occur. Neccasrily we should uphold ourselves: for we will not always have a friend, or otherwise be ineligible to be one for another. That marks the proper spot and what we should mold ourselves around and attend to. "Rather than thinking that passivity, ignorance and cheap action, will bring the busy eyes of others towards you; or better yet, that they are just waiting there for you already. Each compliments eachother as a whole of wrong."

        <div id="norms">
            A culture describes the customs and interests of a people. On a smaller scale, groups of friends or family, even a private society, have their own values and processes. Those latter though generally form either from or out of disdain from the norms within the former. In effect, my family is much like other families as are my friends; in that, the culture on the whole is largely adopted by people at those local scales. Moreso, do my close friends have less time and room to be separate from these norms; at heart they may wish to, and to our demise there was given confidence from me, yet to the current end there has been no differing prevail. Perhaps Seneca's quote of 'you must either remove yourself from or imitate the masses' has some worthwhile relevance here.
            <br>&emsp;Consider the following. To be remarkable one must hown themselves towards a greater path and corresponding result; this can not be done with complacency and irregularity. If a society around is in contrast to this, then one who wishes to be grandly different must effectively reform and bring forth themselves on their own -for you otherwise imitate the crowd. For the man to be happy though he needs value in his expression(and creation); what this amounts to is that the steps he puts forth and the generosity he has is invested with an abundance of attention and care. The issue though is that he can only care so much on his own, especially when you consider how much effort it already takes to be so generous. In that, the values from other people contribute a reciprocal caring of the subject in question. "An easy example is watching a sporting match by yourself compared to doing so in a crowd: the latter obviously increases the involvement and joy that each member has." Our concern though is what activities are we doing, even at the initial cost of being on our own. In addition, we care whether that time invested is substantially and consistent, rather than briefly on occasion. Looking at the sporting example, those games are only ever often, expensive too; moreover, do the goods that one gets from being involved leave you with nothing you can hold onto and later apply. You admittedly earn some relief and sustenance from being involved, but if another episode were not to happen any time soon, the present experience would not hold till then.
            <br>&emsp;Bringing it back, we as men of reason and goodness need to form ourselves so that our natural and constant step molds us permanently through the world. Our stance must remain once we receded back in the commons, wherein we'd prominently be shown and draw more in. Also worth noting is that our place as men of reason is not separate from those without; rather, we are only using our time within the world with more maturity and care. Effectively, this brings us away from dinner and events, but eventually leads us back into the everyday workings with more of a composed and admirable state. In other words, our actions will naturally be spent inside the world of man, in all his institutions and delights; however, we are not like those in the passive norms who get sucked into the indulgence and foolish pleasures far in front of those social offerings. Instead, we hang further back, bringing the goods of liberty and utility into our time of cultivation and production. If the world were more like this then we would not have to recede; as it stands, the bend of it is towards that front of greedy fun and excitement, and so we must bracingly oppose.
            <br>&emsp;My point, is that the developments of that reason and goodness will reach a prominent state wherein its extent meets the middle; I am not saying that those fools will ever see it, but those less recklessly inclined will be. As they say 'one man is a crowd, especially when he is in and from himself'. For that, we must take the time to reach the highest good, and maturely do so if private means are required. Then, will there be fans of the goods we provide; though, this is not onto us and our deliverance, rather onto the objects and interests that are revealed through our reason and greatness. To that, may others be compelled to be more composed and admirable themselves, to which the Man justly delights. "Then, all can make and see there own or others soaring towers."

        <div id="intolerable">
            One of my least favorite feelings is in regard to other people's perceived stupidity. What occurs is that I believe that the view from others is tilted in a way that reflects something starkly different from my own. Historically this has conjured itself as 'Game of Thrones' being a mark of what is true: and my dissatisfaction and resistance to the fact that other people would think it is. What bothers me is that the violence in the show is too much a mix of sharpness and putridity. People are subject to some of the worse things ever presented, and moreso is the depiction set within a well acted and realized world -which makes the experience ever more grim. The position I have on the show is that there is an understandable whiff of character and style. As a product that is meant to be aired and shown, the design of it and execution of it are in some ways at least pointed towards being entertaining. Moreover, would I say that even the greatness it has and where it is bold, reflects things that are entertaining 'because they are so good'.
            <br>&emsp;What I am troubled by, or rather personally in disagreement with, is that this sound depiction is both a measure and sound insight 'to the ways things are, and oh how bad did they use to be'. It is my discontent at others believing this to be true without any consideration that bugs me. It is a similar interjection as those who see a friend, or stranger for that matter, attest to psychics or a casual belief in god etc. -and your impulse is to deny their sentiment and insure a proper replacement. The question, is not whether Game of Thrones is completely accurate, or a warranted reference and measure for how we see the world -and are as such appreciative because ours is different. The point, is that although others may believe this to be true, and that this perceived error on their part may dishevel me personally, our own assessment is wrong. Foremost, are people not having such strictly reverent thoughts towards the prominence of Game of Thrones. First, if it is realistic in its violence, then it is better for the show, rather than exciting an insight to what the truth is. I could further say how the show is not actually erecting a dictated response to other people, or rather that it is not really a psychic swaying people to believe something that is not fully true, but I would be better off raising the thesis point of psychology in this case. Fundamentally, it is our own fear and corresponding sensitivity to other's ignorant proclivity, which evoke a clutching discontent -under the notion that they would see dramatic depiction as true.
            <br>&emsp;The resolve though, in this case, is not to settle the dispute of the impression in question, rather that we more accurately assess whether or not the world around us is so foolishly taken. The route of this is not so strictly whole. We have biases that root us towards reacting and acting in a certain way. It may be the case that some are easily fooled by psychics or take what they say on Tv without any concern of whats aside from the grain of salt; it is most worth noting however, that these actions are not of those who would otherwise be wise and perfect: it is your own misalignment that causes them to appear to be taken away. Personally, your inability to grasp things in an active manner leads to an exaggerated notion of how other people similarly resolve. The truth, is that they may be taken by the impression of a thing, or, may simply be ignorant and passive to it all: it is within the scope and setting of their own biases though. "Through our own ignorance of their actual faulty claim, we press too hard that they in fact have one, and fail to see that it is our own rotten sensitivities that hone our criticism to others. For I, in such a stupid state, struggle with such depictions, even though I know that they are merely dramatic devices. The grinding feeling that I have though, amidst our faulty ways, sees poorly placed empathy and personal isolation, regarding others and their apparent naivety." Better said, when my mind is calm and tranquil, then those chimeras of rapacious brutes -shown in such literary ways- fail to break my own skin, and thus there is no discontent that others would believe the same.

        <div id="course">
            The course of our lives are such that death will always find us. Be it in sports, an accident, sickness or war, our end is coming. Yet we act as though this is not so; for if someone said, regardless of the time till, that a certain date held this event, we'd dredd. "It would then become more readily and clearly apparent." In our youth though, or our younger adult years the time seems to be merely passing, into more that is. The days go and more of them come, and we and the world stay for the most part unchanged. And perhaps our strict place within this dynamic is what keeps us from peering our heads outside the channel. However, I would suggest that it is only when some time goes by that our natural condition rears its head, 'as if it were saying that things can not continue as they do'. What I mean is that being sensible will not come forward as the apparent expression, in one's ever common days. As those moments stack, and the repercussions of being senseless come to fruition, herein are changes made. Whether that is within a relationship, one's health, idleness, frivolity etc, the consequences of these(if negative) will reveal themself as unmanageable: whereupon you will have to make a change. This is why we all grow up, eventually, and admittedly to a small degree. But poor eating, drinking, aimlessness, thoughtlessness etc, bear their marks as conditions which cannot be unaddressed. And from those consequent stains do we at the very least do something other than that which obviously procured them. One of the key wonderings then, is why some people rather than others, make these notes, or pay attention rather, in a more immediate and substantial sense. "Why is it that drinking all day and being void of exercise strikes someone earlier than another as being unfavorable and fallacious?" It is quite hard to explain, or say at least.
            <br>&emsp;A mention here is worth our time. Some people, who do nothing that is, make the comment "I know what to do, I just dont know how to do it." I find this to be a pernicious statement, for two reasons. First, is that you assume that your knowledge of something is eligible prior to the actual use of it. "It's as if someone recommended a shortcut, and prior to actually seeing if it in fact was beneficial, you claimed it was. Better yet, you may assume that you now know a better way, but be unable to if your car was broken." In that case, what bothers me is the fatuous stance on which route they are being delayed. "It's as if their newfound blindness stopped them from seeing contradictories: as if those were in fact already true!" Secondly, and for the most part a practical case, is how when one imparts themself through some sort of action, knowledge is learned. This reflects that prior, or in other words experience builds firmness on some action or thing, but it is upon subsequent use and or participation that further definition is made. In that sense, you develop your view on things as you partake in them. The example would go like this: "I have been training for some time and things are going well. I am doing this sort of regiment and readily sticking towards: I am not making as good of gains though and I feel my interest slipping." In that case, the error is not in their resolve, rather their objective. For in doing something for such length of time, you would think, or at least recommend, that the regiment itself, or principles beneath, be developed and refined themselves. To me, this is the front our concerns, wherein even the heartiest of intentions fall prey to repetitive expressions; with the practical shortcomings being both a decreasing amount of interest and ineffective regard for kinks and or improvements in the course of action. "In other words, we ought to be more principled and adaptive, wherein progress is made with respect to the values that we seek; herein would we alternate our directives based on their delivery of the things we wish for. As they say, 'that an aim for fitness will bring the elements of that out if the actions set towards it are truly effective'. Therefore, we must avoid seeing some route or course for the thing it is, as our involvement will likely wain, as well as succumbing to the passing profits and burdens of mistake. We must simply be more thoughtful."
            <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, I see little in the way of friction or missed opportunity by way of those who are foolish around us. "If we are the prince of a dying kingdom, still we will inherit the funeral." And I am not seeing much in the way of what will take away from me as a consequence of what other people do. Rather, in seeing that their way of living is illdeliberate, then our own mind of doing so will not bring us together. This is what is tough. Not that our family's ill fortune will weigh on us, or that other people's irritable stupidity will actually ignite the world, rather that we on this island of strength and profundity will lack at most a friend. Yet I see in myself that our aim is not to acquire those measures with the aim of fueling our accompanying discontent and rigidity; rather, we would make our own amends, and set ourselves towards the care and needs of our own person, and in turn earn the rewards of doing so -therein setting the flag on the horizons of that line. "Hereforth do those men and woman who served their country and gave me the freedom and time to forever more be the greatest version of myself, I can. But not so that the spoils from their labor are improved. They already fought and died to give me everything I need." This is a country, of beauty and serviceable gains; I have all and am in more ways than not the same. Onto our end then it will be one where the ripe prominence of living is claimed; wherein the soil offered beneath our feet is turned into an orchard, by which we to will become gardeners. And let those worries that brought us to war bring us to a point where those apples are sold, and that those bushels and cider be enough for conflict not to ensure: for we are born and ready by virtue of our course being set, towards an end which routes itself into the point and place in which we are presently made. We will blossom like flowers, balloon like mid summer clouds, or happily pillow over like the death from mushrooms. "I sat with grandeur and strength that this is our course." Nothing more. And as our iron stake, we chisel what its for and towards. By the hilt of this claim and all the fortune that its sheath is provided, do we as the wielders need a target. And, like a piling eruption of liberty and stature, doth we come from the ground below in all its richness, into a mighty trunk of elm and oak, by which the branches are treated and the leaves are embroidered. "And herein does the nector lay." It will be place for living, a position that rests entirely on the grounds it so graciously received. And in being so appreciative will this place grow and look up, to the stars rather than tomorrow's business. This grove of treatment, attention and care, will serve us nothing, for we are already made. Instead, it will vessel our freedom into a mold which will brighten no further, 'for our current mind's eye, we are blinded'. For in freedom, all we can see. "And we are already there."

        <div id="anevenroad">
            For all my life the sun will rise and set, and the moon will come along too. Every 6 months the magnitude of its rise will either gradually settle away, or grow towards. Moreso, do I suspect that our children’s lives will be the same. It is possible that in several hundred years, that desirable space travel is more or less commercial. But for now in this modern age, the earth will do. Moreover, is this just fine. Where else can you find great trees, grass of green, sky of clear and breezy blue. I am not sure. But let’s be clear on something though. Just as our planet has its variety of flavors, so too would another planet’s elements fit inside that roster. Better said, if we were all shades of desert and jungle, and another rock(so to speak) held not but ice and snow, these would together make a summary of palatable sceneries; and the point is that in any of those cases, that none is more necessary than the other. “As it goes, the comfort in food is both in the eating and flavor; but it is in the nourishment and satiation that we seek, of which not but the refined can fail to meet.” In that sense, our planet may in fact have the only pieces of the palate, or there may be others too, but a palette is there no less regardless of where each specific is located. “Apples on Mars bear vitamins and citrus as well as oranges on the coast of Spain.”
            <br>&emsp;Now, if there were a war in America, and there was land that was free on Jupiter, then obviously one would be more favorable. What we can not mistake ourselves in doing, is seeing that latter as any different than another country on earth which is equally hospitable. Since our living is generally on a smaller scale, then the area in which we lived, in Argentina for example, is effectively the same as a similarly warless state of Jupiter. “The error being that Jupiter would be seen as a whole.” This is impractical, but ultimately insignificant, for if it were a massive state by itself, the value of ‘states’ and their present proclivity for war(or any suffering for that matter), would be the determining factor for our choices, as well as what we would look towards and be grateful for.
            <br>&emsp;The reason I think this way, or try and attempt to at least, is that it helps to understand, and fully articulate mind you, that each and all is the same. Why this is, simply rests on the fact that either A) we were not actionable or conscious enough to worry or care, and thus our living did not deliberately matter; or B) we are of that rational kind, or one with forethought and industry etc, and if so then it is the experience that we have that matters most, and therein the scale by which we measure our discipline and grace. In other words, our actions will bring us towards a certain way, and in being aware of this we take comfort in knowing that it will be to a positive end. Having learned that all is the same, renders off the fat so to speak, or in other words trims the faulty and mistaken impressions of what is desirable and to be avoided. “Our life is in front of us and our choice in how we proceed, and therefore what we can anticipate gaining, is very susceptible to apprehension and dissatisfaction: for our expectations were either not met, or in any case dreadful on approach -by virtue of our apprehension.” The truth in all this is that living will always be our claim. Less we be dead, or of those general kinds who have not yet been born, living will be our way. And with that being the case, would good living seem the best. Moreover, would the ripest and soundest kind of experience which this good living amounted to, be most positive when it was substantial and consistent. By that token, those who are masochistic, despite preferring the inflicted pain, may not enjoy other delights, or at least not to any given extent. In contrast, those of a devout or simply principled kind, may fear for not and actually enjoy the world in total. In that case, their kind of living carries some strength as the one which is best amended too; at least this is accurately so if it does in fact provide the regular abundance we seek.
            <br>&emsp;There is a line to be clear, that being the place where specifics come into play. For we can see things which are clearly unsuitable within that sort of living, and thus require little detail or thought from us. What about our careers though, or our families? What do these suggest we do considering that scale? If we want our life to be enriched and lasting, does a child at 20, marriage at 22 and mortgage at 23 feel appropriate? I’m not saying it isn’t, but seeing as the heart of this is complex, our scale demands that we think in a particular sense, or clearly that is. For, in that example, would the results of having that child and family at that period in life, not be obvious in terms of what the effect will be through the years to come? And I must be astute here by saying that if, upon thinking about it and determining a more thought out course, that this direction is desirable and well founded, then good, go for it of; just don’t forgo thinking of it at all, for there may be limitations and overestimates in turns of what is actually on offer. “And one would be quite foolish to ignore those facts, or forgo inquiring about them to begin with.”  
            <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, it is easy to accept that friends, a spouse, a child or a home, will be significant in the rewards they offer. And I don’t mean to suggest that they won’t be enough, but there is a worthwhile insight into the kinds of pleasure that they bring. Having a child is exciting, as is getting married. Once the novelty wears off though, then you are stuck with the reality of it. And sure, it is not like it was while you were expecting it, nor was it like it was in that golden period; but still, comfort, security, clarity, support, warmth, a home, are all there. Moreso, is it generally consistent that these things would be the case. In short, besides any other sorts of living and the pleasures those can bring, choosing this path is as good as any of them. But I would like to draw a comparison, or at least highlight another less clear example. Let’s say you discovered the principal element of the world. It had you up writing and engaged for weeks on end, and more than that had the time leading up to it been wholesome and plump, whilst the weeks that followed saw even more effort of the kind -however light in comparison. First, we can say that this sort of experience is different from those more civil and or familial pleasures. As I said, the value there is in the support and warmth that the scenario brings. Whereas you can see in this creatively indulgent case, that the richness of the experience is made by one’s investment; by that token, in comparison to those other values, we could say that what is pleasurable here is the expression of creativity, contribution, generosity, craftsmanship, industry and worldly love.  
            <br>&emsp;Now, this isn’t to say that people don’t enjoy the generosity imparted onto their families; moreover, does a creative person, or one who is especially so, not necessarily lack any places or spots of comparable comfort and warmth. The key then, is where the emphasis is placed. People don’t like to be thrown at by others; in fact they find it intrusive and overwhelming -like they’re being clinged on to. Whereas an artist may in fact earn some credit and care from another sibling or friend, but the nature of their work is one that generally separates them. The point being, that our life’s route will draw out certain aspects and give them more emphasis when compared to others; none be barred up or strictly absent, but time and attention can only be spread so much. My point is that depending on what sort of experience you wish to have, be it bent towards immediate living and fruitful construction, or that of a warm and secure life, really is up to you. Forgetting to determine what things amount to though, as well as what scale you have to measure by, indicates that an unfavorable result will happen in whichever case; or, at the very least, that whatever good you do have, will gradually slip away -whilst things of a comparably bad magnitude, will similarly trickle in. “And what stake would be worth it to have, if its end saw you absent of one and its gains? That, it seems, is the definition of efforts which are vain.” Let’s get detailed. When it comes to genuine highs, artistry and contribution will provide these more often than social settings and typical fortune. There are surely moments in that latter that reach further than the peaks of that former, but the median line of the former is generally higher. However, the lows of this artist are more common as they may simply lack a friend; though, the conflict and fear of loss within those holding hands, may make the peaks of the other comparably high -in this lower case. “Better said, fighting occurs little between a man and his brush.” He still lacks warmth though; or, at the very least, he would be fortunate in his own right to have a partner or friend that fits effectively within his personal kind of life. The point, is not that we will choose one or the other, but that in all aspects we will do them well. And moreso, that we will root ourselves into the side that we lean, and accept any other shortcomings -with natural progression and worthwhile fortitude in mind(as the good from the other side justifies any other lackings). Personally, I see a lot of families who lose their warmth and lack any creativity at all. I do see a lot of artists who are not so fulfilled, but this seems to me because they are not fully artists. “A creative person lives their life with respect to the world, and in the means by which they express the feelings drawn from the impression of it.” This is a very fulfilling thing to do, but requires that you put yourself into it; otherwise, you will get little from it, and be stuck with the little earnings from that contrary route.  
            <br>&emsp;In plain terms, I just see much more living actually being done by those who are being consistently and elaborately generous. The good from family is both in the warmth offered, and on offer. And admittedly the artist may get burnt out from time to time, or just by consequence from the passing days feel cold deep inside; their running is more substantial though, and their heart beats with solidity and pure passion, with duration too. “I just feel like the glow of my family and friends is to suttle, amounting to at most comfort. It doesn’t give me anything to do, or rightly that is.” Fundamentally, people are extensions of ourselves. “As if we were playing soccer together, or juggling on our own.” The actions we participate in, and our general place in the world, is for the most part objective, in the sense that it wraps itself around us, be it as one, as comrades or in a group. The details here are a real match for me then, momentarily at least; that is, if I seek to distinguish a family who does little, with a centered man who does alot, then I am in need of the energy to do so, well that is.  
            <br>&emsp;I think what I mean to say overall, is that whether we are alone -be it within our regard, or lonesome- or with a family, friendship or some friends, that it is within the world that we express ourselves, as one or together. And my only point, is that those things in the world are objective to us; they do not become more permissible because the bar for what is consequential is lowered through the fortune of your family; moreover, does your solo condition not render you in chains to those things which would otherwise be ripe and fruitful. A good illustration will offer the point. If one were to see the sun, and feel merry and cheer as it went about its way, so too would another friend by your side increase the enjoyment of this experience; wherein you would say it was a welcome accompaniment. This is referred to as friendship, in that you share intrigue and delight in what is good, and an equal amount of restraint and respect for what is unfavorable and bad. What if there is a friend, or group of people for that matter, that besides any condemnation for you being so gayly enthused, simply offered no interest themselves? How is this sharing? The question then is whether it is better to do these rich and grander things on your own, or to drink, belch, ignore, comment, criticize, argue, suppose, and generally be inequitable and tiring, simply because that is where you can share something in the presence of friends. “How valuable are people when the time you spend together is of the sort that it would not suffice by yourself?” I personally believe that what is good for me is equal to that which upon an ally, merely improves it. Because for me, the only thing that wavers in being so impressed by the green of this world is not our satisfaction or mind, but the ease and regularity in which I do it. For it legitimately would be more accessible and significant if I did have a friend. I only seek one of mine though, in that they should be a friend to me. “And thus there is no room for me to share anything else, even if this means that our experience is merely our own to contend.”
        </div>
        <div id="thegood">
            If we have family and friends, then two things are true. One, is that the improvement is to those things in the world. These are what require our amendment and respect, whether it is for civil, fortuned, leisurely or studious gain. Secondly though, is that these objectives are the same whether you are with friends or on your own. Where they differ is in which ones you adhere to, but onto that thing which you would, is the same. Now, I must preface this by saying that ideals are not meant to disown those who are uncongenial towards them during our current thinking; put another way, if someone is with family and relations that bolt them down and away from higher living, then our suggestion regarding ideals is not that this situation should be removed. Rather, as most aims do, it provides clarity and bearing, as to helm one's action further down a certain path compared to the other.
            <br>&emsp;In any case, it seems that our effort and life is best when that world surrounding us is best set upon. That means that drugs, cakes, argumentativeness, stillness, poor ambition and raught tradition, hamper those in all scenarios. The man, lets say, whose aim is in artistry, bears not these claims, for their action and intent is coalesced into a mix of enriched impressions and the accompanying resolve(of generosity that is); whereas those amidst other people may have less trajectory towards the positive end of this world, despite their fortunes nearby. If, for example, someone has a far stretching amount of friends which keeps them busy and engaged, then I say well on. But lacking any significant place in the whole of the world, through creation that is and principal, seems lacking on their part. That is not to say there is no good having a few close friends and a world made of others, but the consistency and abundance of joy, rest, right anticipation and admirable conduct, may come short. Let's be clear that my aim here is not to condemn those who lack peace and enriched happiness throughout their day, but I fear little to explain their lacking of such as a consequence to both their absence from the world in the relevant way, and their otherwise roots within the presence of other people -who are not poor themselves for being there in regards to satisfaction- but may not(and are likely so) not of any differing state as our subject, which in consequence sees them all with some other who is equally void from the world.
            <br>&emsp;What I mean by the world is action. And looking at our days there are moments throughout where they can be of a brilliant kind. Our judgment here is merely an ideal one. I don't propose that having good friends and a common life is vehemently poor, or that those who are lacking in both another and themselves, are not the worse of the two. But onto that scale of what is most positive, neither compete. A point then is worth bringing up. Simply, we can distinguish the degree to which something is good or bad, and value them accordingly, 'but we must have an equally firm taste for goodness itself, just as we must have an equal distaste for all badness itself.' In other words, my belief is that living consistently throughout the day, and regularly so, holds the most good, whereas comfort, security, thrills and fun are less good, and in some cases bad.
            <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, we are henceforth looking for the good, and increasingly so. And, to reiterate, will we say that despite any moments of it being present -as this can be the case in almost any sort of scenario- that we'll anticipate and hope for a true constance of it, enriched too. In that sense, there is reason to declutter poor estimates we have regarding the world, seeing as that space is where your expression finds itself. One reason that friends and people are lacking, is that your training, sleep, food, reading, film interest, story experiences and writing, bear no social setting; in those cases, we are truly on our own -with friends offering at best a warming glow. In regards to our view on the world then, we can see that its draw on us is mixed, that being whether we do something as one or together. The point being, that in a group or on your own, your actions place themselves to objects -which is what we refer to as the world. And which ones we choose, and in which way we act upon them, determines the heart of our lives. And I feel like I'm assuming little that those prior actions are either necessary or for benefits. Seeing as they are things done by yourself, does not exempt one from simply having friends, and only participating in actions according to that. "For our feet may have great itinerary and roots for fun, but not for lasting joy or rest, if those prior efforts are forgone." Our life needs to be more rounded than that. One thing to note, is that what we mean by consistent and abundant good, is that joy, rest, peace, tranquil and dreamless sleep, firm posture and breath, ill restlessness, avoidance of anxiety and stress, and no apprehension or grueling regrets, are each provided in their corresponding ways. Since our actions in the world will return us the sum of this experience, it gives merit to choosing the right things to do in that world; or better put, that there is some good in our objectives -if we want this favorable result.
            <br>&emsp;What is causing me to restep and tread on my heels, is that it is unclear what a normal person really ends up doing. Let us just say that with the support of others, they enact themselves onto the world, for both fun, principal and profession, and be it to other people, institutions, nature or activity. I simply feel that if certain things are lacking, or in some way lacking emphasis, then one's objective rewards will be more hollow and poor. Again, it is that register of aspects that mix together to become a lastingly good experience. This is our utmost scale. And rather than recommend which things one ought to do, we can at least say that per one’s bearing and proclivity to receive, that an object's impression and reward will itself be objective. In that sense, I mean that our judgment will have to be imparted, and measured against that foremost scale. All I mean is that if you want to do these certain things, or that those things lacking are o.k to you, then be clear that this being the case will have its objective effects. Donuts not being in your life will remove the effect from donuts, just as writing consistently will bear the effect from writing. "Regardless of what you prefer and deem suitable, know that the way things are, is in an objective place, aside from your view of them lets say. Be at least clear on that."
            <br>&emsp;Less our judgment has some place, and considering that we are otherwise on our own -in both the acceptance of good and bad- then a tautology is the only explanation. That is, things will do this on account of the particular thing: if this is good or bad, use your judgment, whilst remembering that things will have their objective effects. In that sense, the point is that being clear on what those effects will be, and what your values are, are strictly important by virtue of 'some effect surely happening at all'. And I could suggest what is good on account of my own judgment, or be impartial and say that one should be thoughtful and discerning by themselves. For one, my ability to give recommendations is resisted by that fact, that my advice is out of place and not mine to give. "Where I might otherwise plead that one is careful, or cautious." Being a writer though my thoughts have open reign, and are looking for clarity of their own; thus, I may attempt to be ostensibly suggestive for the sake of mending our own thinking. Another limitation grows though, in that being objective as to what things we should do is simply a hard thing to say. Again, in reiteration, my kindred passivity roots itself tautologically, in that I would prompt someone to be thoughtful about themselves on the basis that things will act on you as they do; the point being that your admission and resolve to any which thing should not be without initial discernment. In our writing though, or if we are actually giving forward advice, requires that we mold the world and our general lives, as to extract some sort of principle or law, which by itself indicates what we are congenial towards. I could distinguish the two approaches in that the first was hopeful and passing, whereas the latter is more direct, but merely based on strength and likelihood. For that to be so, our casing of the world can only be sufficient if the specifics on offer dangle from above. "For if we start with those, then the expense will be holes in our frame." We can thicken it though, the frame that is. We are all people, and mortal as such. Moreover, will food, sleep, responsibility and the future always be on our plate. Additionally, does our self regard give some credit to the fact that actions and good living are truly sought for at all. In fact, we can mix in the value of what's most positive as a fundamental aspect regarding our existence. "In some ways, this is true and warranted by virtue of us asking at all -for it suggests the place of an appropriate way to be."
            <br>&emsp;What we are trying to achieve is a suitable mold. This is not in it required that everyone else's life is accounted for, or that they would(if so) listen. I am personally trying to have a better target and grasp when it comes to living our best. So, we will begin by encompassing ourselves to the world; moreso, will we draw borders around it -in a national sense- but that of states and cities too. The former does have its literal restrictions, whilst the other is for our regards as to placement, but each rests on the fact that we are either A) somewhere local, and B) without imposition to be in any given locale, seeing as there are plenty where we can be. Now, these positions that we are in have similar elements; those being civil rules and services, familial rules and services, right and wrong ambitions, and our foremost place for activity. Across these, there is a sentiment of regard that ranges from 'what we have to do, and what will earn us more from doing so, or make it easier to accomplish, and that this is what we seek, and how we can do so more often, and to a higher degree'. This for the most part is sufficient for me to explain what one ought to do. I'll be clear, that I am in fact only trying to say what I ought to do, but in the sense that if someone were the same then our advice to one another would equally fit, and being able to consider the time and place for more than just one feels more approachable. To be clear, I am aware that people have different environments, hopes, fears and positions and that none will ever be the same. It is our understanding though which we seek to further, the aim of which is bettering the guide which orients us as to choose better and end up better within that respective life. "In that I earn more from seeing those around me as comparable. Or at least it smoothes our thinking to imagine so."
            <br>&emsp;Something not unimportant, is that we are merely trying to understand. Our goal as stated, is to simply reach a point where the flow of our life is without reckless distaste or ambition, and rather filled with rest, tranquility, richness and joy. People, bring this out in us, in both the company we have in our enjoyment, as well as increasing the value of the thing at hand. Their effect can be opposite though, in that important things are given less value, or at the very least their enjoyment is lessened in the presence of certain people; or, they detract from your value of important things, and instead encourage and or praise your efforts toward worse ends. My goal is to simply say that our life has a bearing, is improved upon with people, muddied by their presence when it's unsuitable for that aim, and overall that our best is when we further reach this way. That is all. Now, comfort and stability come into question here, as one may say 'what, you don't have a girlfriend, a career, a posse of sorts!', and I say "yes, I truly don't, and moreover do I wish I did. But I will not substitute a version of those things for a shortening of these things which I currently have". Furthermore, would I state and affirm the fact that all who are then good and congenial to me and this rightful way, will come about and join our path, take part in it at least, as long as we walk it. And either A) I have only begun, or B) have been going and have not crossed another suitable for this lane. In that though, I would plead that pity not be placed, for the good at the end of this trail is drawing enough, so much that even without a friend I am carried by it.
            <br>&emsp;All in all, we are left to bear what choices we have made; and, to reiterate, that even choosing well is enough to fill it up, regardless if the ends have come to fruition. "Doing what we feel to be right is ample enough to keep us encouraged and satisfied. For we feel like we're going somewhere born out of that foremost stake." Moreso, does that underlying wish for warmth and security -and its tendency to prevail- assure us that when it comes, it will be towards and in congruence with this better end. In contrast to this are those moments of gluttonous and idle regret, where being overly comfortable at the expense of firmness and application hollows one out, and makes them feel as if they were at best stirring, rather than being truly alive. And so we can build on that by saying that each of our aims are upward, and to whichever path we are brought, and whomever and whatever comes along or misses the way, that we can all accept and kindly agree that each may learn their own, but equally assume and be privy to the disdain of things which are poor in themselves, only that those who partake in them are not the objects of that contempt - only the results(or states) which reflect the dimness of our heart. So be poor or rich, I care not. But you are a man, or a person rather, and that means the regard for myself includes you both in my desires as well as where the scale in which I'd employ applies to. "You are relevant and suitable for my wholesome discrepancy." Again though, if you fail to meet these standards, or find truth elsewhere, Ok. But to those things which I view as bad, will my judgment remain.
            <div class="qu">No matter our differences we are still kindred and cordial, communal too at heart. We may simply walk apart. "But your home shares the same soil as mine. Grow as you please, but frett not if I nevertheless see you as a gardener, as I."</div>
            Let us summarize, for there is a crucial detail that needs reminding. On the whole, and generally I might add(considering the type of thing we are), that what is good is that which we are best to move towards -and more or less end up at. Now, what this is, firstly at least, is not particular or objective; rather, we can say that to whichever good(and corresponding end) this would be, that positivity is ubiquitous to any kind -of outcome that is. Now, this may be of an indifferent sort, as in the ways of a sheep or rock, but when it comes to Man, or at least one who is deliberate, then the end for us should reflect that. In effect, our actions are like those of the former, only done so with more huff and gust, and forethought to, as if we had planned for it and sought for a higher being within it. "As if we were acting for sake of the actions themselves." Whereas a deer may be compelled towards its good of running away from wolves or nibbling on shrubs, but without much care or attention as to what they're doing -by virtue of their baser nature merely bringing them along towards what is appropriate for survival. What is suitable for us, or at least where we are in contrast becoming more congenial towards, is actions that are good in themselves. This means that we seek the warmth of a spouse or joy of a friend, not for the benefit later on, but because it is what is worthwhile right now. And, as our kind of nature reflects, would thinking about this being the case, and deliberately addressing which things were appropriate for that, would not only garnish us with a self respect and ease as results from trying to live well, or good that is, but actually conferring the benefit and gain that we currently seek -by virtue of targeted intent.
            <br>&emsp;The question as always then, is whether there is any good in particular things in a universal sense, or is it specific to the subject. Of varying kinds sure, as a Dolphin enjoys jumping through the water, it also doesn't care to read. We on the other hand, have our own common proclivities and or tendencies which reflect, that which when applied, returns the greatest living. What I mean to clarify then, is that however unobjective we can be onto which objects are good, we can at least be honest and admit to the attributes associated with the result that any favorable action of ours would have. Again, this is based on the fact that, however varied in peculiar aspects and or scenarios, that our heart and bones(so to speak), or at the very least the roots of being cognitive and(more or less) industrious), does suggest that to whichever particular end of, that between us all they'll be comparably the same. In that sense, be it of family and friends, crafts and study, ambition or philanthropy etc., that each would be seen as good(in the result) if the following sorts of elements were present. Joy should be there, as something contrary to this is literally explained as something you don't enjoy doing. Rest should similarly follow, as being restless upon completion suggests that either something more will have to be done, or at the very least the current session fails at being fulfilling -for if it were, you would be pleased(with joy), but then able to rest(as if you were satisfied). In addition, the means by which you experience these things should not go against the other; drinking and parties are fun, and generally are full of enjoyment -little rest is on offer though, upon finishing that is. On top of that, would responsibility, your ability to participate in things that were good themselves, or one's strength in avoiding which was bad, will to our doom falter, leaving us with not but hopeful dreams and intent -as we wish to return to a point of action that left us without debts. Another important thing is that what we are doing should give us commendment of ourselves, as if upon thinking about it, or at least having thought about it before, measures up to what we believe is good to be. "If we set out to lose weight and later on noticed that we had, or were otherwise in the process of exercising, then by noticing this we are bringing ourselves to a more respectful position, personally. In contrast, had we stopped training, or noticed that our effect within it had been worse than we'd expected, then our pride is consequently dampened. Accordingly, we will not only feel poor and little, but discouraged too, which confers even more detriment as further good grows increasingly distant."
            <br>&emsp;As a fuller picture, I can say at the back -where more base actions are done, such as training, eating, deliberating- ought to be beneficial in a positive sense, but also void of negative effects when it comes to sleep, breathing, posture, walking, stretching, labor and common discourse. By that latter I mean that our actions don't produce future moments of shortness and irritability, rather that our success within those wholesome gains would give us the ability to listen more, endure through stress and ill fortune, or simply be patient, thoughtful and kind. Moreover, when it comes to those former elements of health and well being, that their consistency in being experienced bears the soundest mark, or measure that is, by which separate actions are judged by. "And again, drink all you will, but if your sleep seeps into detriment, and increasingly to, then that is for you to contend with -while you otherwise drink. To which end you will sacrifice, the choice is yours." The other end of this fuller portrait reflects the prominent aspects of your life. General content and happiness is good, but it swirls a bit inside the middle. What we are addressing are those moments, and corresponding activities, that see you drawn and engaged, lastingly to, and leave you with not but a feeling of richness and accomplishment. These activities range from study and writing, specialized training and recreation, particular interests in TV and Film, fun and immersion of games(from shooters to Sim), and if fortune bears us the claim, a sincerely well founded discussion. To me, these all amount to the peaks of our lives. They are not in themselves sex, or drugs, or momentary relief and excitement, rather they are things which abundantly you actually do, and embroider you with a feeling that you have lived and produced. "Those former experiences are admittedly pleasurable, but their effect is generally passing. Whereas these latter leave you feeling full for a comparably higher time. Not only that, but you have much clearer, strong, deep and commendable views of where your action will go next. While those previous lot leave you feeling a little dirty and hollow. 'That is why they call it finishing'." Wrapping these two sides together, are those baser actions and their aim of constant and easy solidity, with those in front, who live off of that ground, blossoming like flowers gifted with the grace of good roots and nourishing soil. In some ways then, our attention really should be onto that foundation, for it is where our living is built from; it is only of a formative kind though, as those forward actions need their own design and admiration -as to be clear and able to use the energy at hand, as well as being resolute and staked on their goodness, as we might otherwise see our ability better spent towards experiencing cheap thrills and short lived pleasures. "Whereas these and their total sum of widespread living, is a lasting one, and increasingly prominent too." That is the whole of it.
            <div class="qu">I don't mean for this measure to be aimed at scrutiny or harsh judgment; I am merely including those who I consider equal in relevance to the understanding which I seek to have. I only bring others into the question because it allows me to advance more effectively towards the truth: the only intent is for me to use it though. And in that case, for me personally at least, do I fear not that others would beguile me as to their inclusion in my assessment, or that they would treat me with their own harshness because this was the understanding that I had. I simply suspect that in being this way, and resolutely too by virtue of who I am, that none will be there to share it with, or to further learn, explore, develop and enjoy. And seeing as this attempt of mine is a legacy one at this point, you can see why my current steps to further advance are so severe and astute. "For the end, in effect, which they mean to promote, is one that must carry us by itself: who else would be there to share it?"</div>

        </div>
        <div id="suitableconduct">
            The good is in proper action; that is, within an operation there is appropriate conduct within the matter. So, in a scenario of piety, prudence and grace are good in that they are in line with what piety requires. A better example is in skilled labor, in that a machine or device has a proper way of using it; whereupon doing so, or failing to and stumbling, would the former be commentated on as ‘Good’, whilst the latter would confer ‘try again’ -as to avoid saying that was bad. Secondly, in summary, are the investigations of the machines themselves. Note, that our preferred outcome is one thing with respect to the total of all things, but we can say that an oven, for example, has the aim of baking, of which the act of doing so well will be good for this. The point then, is how do we know what baking needs, or is in the first place. This, as I would generally suppose, calls on the means of science, wherein an object’s identity and possible purpose is brought into question. So if we had a large iron blade, a sharp piece of metal that is, then its use could be of military or decorative kinds. Now, to reiterate, whether one should be done over the other requires a higher understanding of what things one ought to generally do; in this case, we are merely explaining that in either use case, this is how the object could be appropriately used. And I would say that we can base these illustrations on the fact that we are creatures of utility. “We are not making the mold for reality as to make the forms act and arrange, rather we are trying to see how things are in themselves, by virtue of our opportunistic curiosity.”
            <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, through analysis we can see the use of the blade. At the very least we can say its operations are derived as such as they appear with relevance to us. “For a pile of gold might otherwise be viable as a paperweight. ‘Though King Midas may himself seek an opportunity with that.” In this scenario, we could describe how our tools of analysis were merely such, in terms of what’s useful, by further understanding what a thing was in order to see what it did. Two thoughts come to mind. One, is that by being more detailed and focused, on the sword let’s say, then we may become more capable in wielding the sword(by the use case) as well as employing our construct capacities to a greater effect(by our resourceful mean). Secondly though, we may discover that its main component was iron, and that it itself can be smelted into other use cases. In that sense, by virtue of our curious nature, an analysis aimed at bettering our use of an object, may in fact allow us to perform and or manufacture other objects. A good example is the lightbulb, whereby its benefit from lighting our nights, also saw further understandings of how light worked itself. Consequently, direct advances in electronics were derived, as were accompanying advancements in engineering and physics.
            <br>&emsp;To bring this to an end, we can say that beneath the proper use of an item, or the proper display within an operation, is the understanding of what the conduct is, what would be useful to us when we operate, as well as alternative devices and or routes that become beneficial themselves. Herein though have we reached our limit. Or mine at least as we’ll say. For at this point can I only decipher and explain the metrics of desire and avoidance seemingly conducive to us as people, but an objective measure seems otherwise a challenge to claim. I wonder though if there either is one, or one that we would find useful or consequential, compared to that earlier sentiment that we could say sufficiently defines what is good for us -as we would commonly expect as people. “Perhaps the lord’s aims are other.” But if we do not know that truly, then would the reach of our opportune casing not mark the point of sufficient regard. ‘Wherein all that sat beneath did so with proper respect for what they are bent towards doing, to which we could then soundly amend?”
        </div>

        <div id="theprince">
            I figure that as we proceed, our outcome will be the same. This is why, in fact, they say excitement throws us off before something actually happens, for in anticipating it we become restless and fearful whether we can make it happen, or that it will occur at all. Seeing what you like is fine, but merely as a natural end to our wavering conditions; that is, as we go through our days, and have time that is full of hopeful energy or that of idol daydreaming, we think of the time ahead. And letting yourself do so is fine, but remember to come back to where you are. "Otherwise, you will dredd over every detail to an unproductive degree."
            <br>&emsp;Now, it's not that those events call for little, and that knowing more precisely how their various elements will be tended to is unimportant, but the event itself is not part of our action, now at least. This is because these future happenings are usually the result of some choice, a resolve no less. And again, thinking over what that choice will be or how its important aspects can be dealt with, is not itself unimportant. But there is no choice right now. And if you figure that an accompanying amount of aims, privilege, fortune, grace, appreciation, congruence and or indifference sits beside our eventual chance to proceed, then you can see that the simple act of choosing fares no difficulty at all. "Both in terms of what it asks, and what struggle there is in terms of what we need it to do."
            <br>&emsp;Lets say we mean to move, to a new house that is at some point ahead. In our case, the amendment will simply be to move, and get through the logistics of choosing where to go. Getting there will be simple, as will the road ahead from getting there. Looking for homes then is not unimportant, but only relevant when you get to that point of looking. And surely, the selection will be smaller than if you were there locally -as you will have to virtually call. But, remember, that our skill, persistence, freedom beforehand and ease upon arrival will level the lands around this predicament, so much so that the widely applicable measure for success will be met. And then were there.
            <br>&emsp;My point, is that you can choose to do this now, and moreover do we not know when it would be preferable or beneficial to do so. As it stands, our life is just standing, growing an inch or two every day. If we simply show up, then our place here will be lasting as well as our eventual return. From that, there seems less worry required about a plausible choice, admittedly, but one that bears little impact in what it requires and affords. And seeing as all is in most practically, if not strictly at the moment the same, then we are better off and fine to currently be. And to that, do I sit here progressing, tuned, and tailoring our strength; moreso, do our aims that run from this sit as mere targets and guidelines, as to bring our ever advancing place into a more subsequent and favorable direction. If we look at all that we wish to write, as well as our leisurely interests beside, then we can be happy that our only expectation is to properly show up. "For the practice within this developing state, prompts us to partake in the interests we have so long as we are present and able. And our goal then and care, is in being prepped and ready to arrive at that." And there is no room to worry about voicechat, the simplest of bills and formality, and the even easier process of moving(once clarity is cemented).

        <div id="outcome">
            The fact that the world will go round and round is merely a garnish to the fact that every position is the same. This is because in terms of what we seek, and what really withholds us, simply reflects the cold and warmth of our days. Most other scenarios are passing ones, or those which we impart on ourselves. "The only real difference is where we are in the rotation; whilst those other misfortunes are mere moments of inconvenience: for we generally overcome it, see it for something lighter, or simply move on and take our following steps ahead." It seems appropriate then that we would not bank our life as though any of it will change. Now, transferring our placement in the world does bear excitement, 'but only will a subsequent change bring you to a point that is any different than where you left'. What you will find is that all contention and doubt, and criticism for that matter, comes down to comforting our place when aims and principle are lacking. Assuming those goals were sound, then we could see how their foundation within natural tribute and care, sees no particular place required -by virtue of the majority influences (of the moon, stars, clouds and sun), being relatively constant in what they provide(necessary in the smallest case). Herein, if the world is generally all the same, or within the variety still offering the same quality(regardless of flavor), then our position bears no real worth so long as we have values, interests, objectives, ambition, resolve, attention, generosity, strength and care; moreso, that it was directed at and deliberated on to a scenario which has no borders or bounds, or better said, that our purpose is not suitable in one place over the other, 'as we are everywhere that we go, in which the catalyst for our living is brought and glows'. "And this light simply asks for a canvas, of which there is plenty -for treatment by the indifferent giver to that is." Nowhere can we improve. Fortune can offer different tastes, and generally there is an acceptable stance on our own infidelity and the wishes that correspond with the relief of that, but there is no other principal way. "These alternatives of gold and travelers fortune are mere dressings to an otherwise ubiquitous core; in there, doth we dredd ourselves if our heart is not bent or reverent to that lane, and moreso then will those additions be but mere seasoning, rather than any bulk or grain."
            <br>&emsp;Self regard is an important feature of this, as we typically come from a place in which virtue and justice were absent. Par for the course, is a result wherein one's personal attention brings them to a point where the aims of their prior state are seemingly achievable. In other words, we become wise as we fall in line with the world, but in effect become more capable. Moreover, as we cement ourselves into this way and 'add some meat to this righteous bone', so does our product and creativity. Therein, does our prior roots of ambition, as well as the pressure of being so prudent and astute, migrate our interests towards reliefs and success of that lower sort. "Wherein we spend our new founded pure tradition, on comparably lecherous ends." What I would suggest then instead, is to come to terms and develop a grasp on who you actually mean to be. For fortune will come, and prospects are never far away. But we must not see those as the world; and moreso, must we not confuse their respective promise as some end which is more comforting and exciting, yet admirable. Put another way, as ones who have their heads underground, in search of ourselves and our re-establishment we must not confuse more dazzling objectives for ones that upon our own righteous use, would in fact be proper. "For in our efforts as men, we become so only through cultivating it; and if we see other spots for employment as suitable 'because we as the greats are now placed in them', will only see that the gains of those formative efforts sizzle away."
            <div class="qu">In other words, acts for men must be sought for and seen as what they are with respect to what is appropriately mature. Whereas those of boys, ought to be seen accordingly similar</div>
            Nevertheless, the point was that on our path to be more pure and stout, ought we regard ourselves in such light, and reflect on who we are and what we seek to do in context of that. In some ways, I personally see the fact that our life is readily setting itself in front of me. And again, I am aware of future credits, or expected fortunes, but there is really just the year ahead. Any farther than that, and I can only see that stretch of time where we are on our own: in which our current principal grants us the simplest of sufficiency. "So I am just to simply show up." Coming back to that point, and building on this as an example, can I see what is next and how I'd like it to be. "But I see very little that is required for anything right to come around at all." In fact, instead of making the error of staying inside the hypothetical goods that you engage with, simply think about these things for the sake of anticipation and clearness, then return to this point of self regard, wherein you address yourself as one who is merely present and growing right now. In that, will the proper vector be one of general excitement by virtue of goodness being present from any end that comes, as well as a rooted indifference to any outcome which might otherwise appear uncomfortable. "In that last sense, you are only giving plausible occurrences more figure and charm by thinking of them; and what is right, is to instead focus on the fact that there is very little that you can do to dictate the result." However, if you engage in the contrary of this fretting, and merely assess what you really care about and the ease by which it can be achieved, then the wideness of the lens will grant you both a calming relief and breezy advance, as well as encouragement by the positive outcomes and or likelihoods that this rested state of yours sees.
            <br>&emsp;In that, if we relax and let ourselves go, tending to our heart and lawful loins instead, then what is actually more likely to happen will become more apparent -and seemingly favorable. For me, this reflects the ground level fact that our funds and profit are set to last for the near year to come; moreso, the events that have expressed themselves as likely to follow, offer me much unapprehension at our return to the coast, future support from our parents, sooner or later privilege through the following year or two to come, as well as our actual inheritance (of sorts) upon our father's death. And I don't mean to be morbid, I merely am aware with how I would rightly use it -which drags me little on approach, for there is very little that I need right now. "Henceforth why I am unafraid to look forward to it, for I am not restless without out". Bringing this all together then, that self regard we have truly benefits us when we refer to it as our regular advancement and indifferent ease onto the steps that come. Not only does lightness and creative engagement accrue, but so does the future and all that it could bring. "For in being unafraid of what will come or what you are supposed to do, does a profitable choice or welcomed end become acceptable to merely sit there, as my choice in the matter bears no haste or care. So I will just let the probability of it happen -while I gently and flourishingly proceed."
        </div>
        <div id="mark">
            I can either reflect on the past and address hows its moments are impacting me right now, or I can consider the future and what it is I wish to accomplish. For one thing, it is not like there is anywhere for us to go. And even if some project or stage in our life would allow us to be more adventurous and engaged, so will this not happen with any ease or necessity; that is, a great deal of time will be required to even simply be yourself -by which the extension of that will give you what you genuinely seek. Of those outer things which flaunt our eye, will they demand even more; moreover, less we are without much thought on the matter, would we otherwise come to see that such ends would in fact be more of the same. "For as Socrates says, wherever you go, by your legs let's say, so will the body follow." The point being, that if you were fine here, then the reasons for so would see your ends comparable no matter the position. "It's as if all we needed was water, yet we saw great pleasure in those things which conferred confidence to there being more later on, yet right now there is ample amounts, lastingly to; moreso, when we look at the future, it is admittedly bright in what its course will offer, as well as being sufficiently met by things which we will be necessarily able to address: so why elsewhere ponder?"
            <div class="qu">In that, we will always have enough, as will the line of what we are ingrained to have and the means by which even more will come -persisting and improving</div>
            Im noticing though that there is less to compel me to wake up in the morning. There is to be clear alot of poor choices from even duller thinking that have me lagging behind, though, two things seem otherwise promising. One, is that you can solidify the scope of your nourishing efforts as to be more dense and substantive. Instead of doing a moring flow, followed by a hatha stability, with later rest and recovery for evening and before bed, simply do a great session that boldens them all. Rather than a slew of sequences, do this giant bout of standing, upper body, torso and recovery. This is effective in that your goal for the day is clear and compounded, as well as branching you off to do more voluntary sequences; these may naturally come after, or embellish themselves as the moments of focus for the day. "Moreover, would the simplicity that followed be reason enough." As I see it, sessions are wide yet shallow -moreso are their elements general- whereas a sequence is narrow and focused. In that way, this latter is more select and repetitive in its effort, while the session is more welcoming to other exercises that fit into the standing, holds, torso or recovery molds. "For in these moments, the goal is to complete the whole; and so side raises, handstands or pigeon pose can be done as promptly as the rest. Whereas the chaturanga sequence is best done from down to drop to up and back several times, with only light variety in between." In other words, broader efforts make way for niche elements, while focused ones fair better when the concentration is select to ones we regularly do.
            <div class="qu">In a similar way would more oranges fit our bill during the days, where some is good, so more is plenty!</div>
            Now, the front end of these remarks is in having more to do. We are not vying for some great project though, with the aim of it bringing us somewhere, rather we are presently trying to do what it is we can do the most. So we wrote a book, rebuilt our website, set up our studies, music and channels. Pictures are good to follow, as well as additions to those prior. Writing too is its own ripe reward, with our strength and ease elsewhere giving amendable time to produce within these investments. I think what is happening, is that we are not in short of things we want to do, rather we are too shuffled on what the requirements are and our view of there worth. "It seems less important to wake up early or to be so orderly when our aim is merely personal and passive." It seems then that a grand project or some mighty sort of business would justify more elaborate means -as to reach these greater ends. Writing though, requires little, as do games, movies, formatting and reflection. Industry does require immediate cares, which in practice spreads out the provident efforts into select pieces, but generally if our ends are purely onto our drifting rewards, then so the means can be more relaxed. In that sense, would a big bout of hatha as well as a big bout of strength, earn us the requisite blocks for our living to flourish widely ontop. "Whereas strict efforts equally high above need equally narrow foundations below." That's not to say that errors won't be made and that rules won't be better in place. However, my experience is that it is those narrow confines of good and provision that result in us stepping outside of the line. And these errors are never so bad, but they are hard to amend to, and as a result leave us with nothing: for the top is hard to return to. If our times are one of prominence though, and widely so in the means and their ends, then mere principals apply; that is so for the sides cant be fallen out of, rather we can fall too far below -where sugar lies. Eating breads, potatoes, figs, smoothies, quinoa, barely, corn and rice, as well as oranges(in plenty), kale and mushrooms, almonds or pistachios, and anything that is in whole generally true, feeds that expanse that is our living. "For there is little room for specific error, as the room for our life is as big and wide as its action claims."

        <div id="construct">
            The core truths of our lives have to do with food, training, careers, family and death. Though these are each common in our lives and expected to happen in whichever fashion, ought we discern what a good end from each would mean, and how our directed time can affirm this as the norm. In a similar way, we spend our time and attention in pursuit of office, commerce, property and profession, so why don't we direct those means towards the aspects of our lives which truly impact us? Money gives us no real friendship, nor does office and wealth provide the means for genuine parentage and familial bonding; in fact these things more often than not find themselves at the mercy of such ambitions. Instead, we can recognize that each scenario that we are in really offers us the same; if it is tough, it is usually our sensibility and fortitude that evens out any of the challenge, and firms us against whichever difficulty remains. If it is favorable and interesting, then our generous response and accompanying gratitude brings out the scene as to be more significant and reliable. "For we see it more." This feels appropriately contrary to that ignorant notion that one's position in life will act like an ointment to stress and hardship, or if something good occurs, that it is the promise of more and the luxury provided that is seen as good. "This is besides the stronger point that in either case, it is we who determine the affective result: as we are the vessel by which these scenarios come through. And there is a genuine lack of wisdom to see the latter as the priority, rather than our selves."
            <br>&emsp;The point though, is that even though we wish to be happy and void of distress, our application of these values must first be set onto things which are most prevalent. A good example is in doing business well but sleeping poorly. That former will eventually be outweighed by the lows of the latter as well as being brought down in what it personally brings. Now, if we focused on our sleep, then that care or mindset might see the business as less important or simply ineffective regarding the scales in place. But this is our core tenant, that of living and its goodness that we forwardly seek, no matter the cost or prior interest of things themselves. "We ought to become wise and sensible, then assess what things are with respect to that; here, will we learn the core truths of ourselves in that we have addressed the things most relevant and near to us, and with a mind of determining how they ought to be seen and arranged so that a good experience is claimed."
            <br>&emsp;Everything must center around this point. otherwise, we are headed for a place where goodness is absent, or bad at least is too prevalent( as in those thieving billionaires). Furthermore, are we better to be sensible and measured as opposed to vehemently principled, as these kinds of routes suggest that you are ingrained to an extreme response to the badness that was prior; moreso, do you forgo the broad applications in both your generosity and core regard, as regimented and strict systems typically resist any sort of change, so improvements and or corrections(of errors) fail to be made. Thoughtfulness, admiration and respectful assurance bring us a better way. This is because the particular aspects of our lives are given the room and space to cultivate under the guise of our sensibility. At the base we are then given a nourishing and dutiful strength, and in response an upfront means for industry, friendship and care.
            <br>&emsp;This life is a rounded one; moreso, does it fit well with its own address of family, civil liberties and death. As a science we know not that it is true, only that it is strong. Our framework that explains this is merely one with meat on the bone, and this is only in an increasing state, a tended one, rather than being complete. There are many reasons for this, as are there for it being enough. Foremost is this because we recognize that there is a game, and that seeing so suggests that the point of our reasoning is to better demonstrate ourselves in it and earn the sought for rewards. Learning about the game and nature of play itself, merely serves us to be more strategic and tactical, only for the better though as opposed to something vain -or idly technical. This is because the state that we reach wherein we would say that our end was true, is merely one of prominence; for those ends are ones where we are living, moving, reassessing and confirming, reflecting and improving and all sorts in between. "We may know more and thus be able to further grow and produce, but our need to digest does not go away; our merit in reasoning then is merely to provide more fruits, for our nature which remains."
            <br>&emsp;Truths then are associated with things themselves and in many ways are defined with respect to them. Simply, these insights mark the experience that we see as favorable and desired, and which things show themselves as fitting or not for that. "We know that sleeping is important; that is a value. That chocolate before bed negates this is a very basic truth but one no less. Whether or not veggies would be better is comparably known and assessed, but we may either experience this first hand, or merely suspect based on what our prior reasoning suggested about the time before sleep." In that sense, as we evaluate things, we learn more about the values we need. In that prior case, we could say that food before bed is quite poor, as its place is better for breakfast and during the day. What this may mean otherwise, is that when we had sugar in the morning we felt terrible, as did bread feel poor in the afternoon and rice before sleeping. Specifically, we know something about these, but generally do we know that the time that we eat is important; in that way, we may find things to perform otherwise, or are merely suitable compared to those more vicious things -sugar fairs worse at all times compared to broccoli, yet initial and closing moments care less for each. Put another way, we can say that things are superior or not to one another in a certain respect, but that the principle may in fact thrive from absence. "A small murder is better than a huge one, but both are still lacking good." And it's not to say that this model for thinking and assessment is complete and perfect, but it is a serviceable one. We'll take the heart of it then and apply it to things, which in the end is all that we seek, rather than the means to know: as the former is our aim.
        </div>
        <div id="deliberate">
            A friend is that person who cares about something that you do; the effect then is that you share something, which amounts to more openness and care to be involved. Being drawn though is not without its risks, as the same as it is on your own with bad things, so do those interests that are bad with friends deserve equal contempt. "The good though may only find you alone in place; yet when a friend comes by, or with your state as a friend to yourself, will the right ends and their steps be better set, for both regularity and reward." Parents too have their ways, as their place is one of giving but also stubbornness. Our course though comes to fruition here, as when they pass away will time and privilege be enhanced, or furthered at least. "So be respectful and trustful that their care for you is genuine, and that being happy is all your free to be: so be."
            <br>&emsp;The truths of training and food are the most expansive here, as there are so many specifics that result in various effects. I'll name a few for each. Circuit training fairs the most when it comes to strength as an accessible yet significant amount of cardio and resistance can be achieved. As a prior our hatha works well as does its resting emphasis in the later day that follows; moreso, as it is in the morning, does a flow sequence following our workout smooth us out and allow for initial and subsequent stretching. Regarding that hatha, the central count fairs the best. In this case, breathing for at least one whole time during the pose allows for each one to be administered well and transferred optimally towards the next. Breathing in and out is how you want to come in and out of each position, yet a full breath in between is where the openings rise. Moreover, that less you wish to do many minor sequences, that major sessions can be simply done. Here, you combine standing, holds, core work and rest into one large address. One of the benefits is that its width allows for efficiency to be had with less focus and intensity, whereas a smaller session gains its benefits from a higher standard. This lower threshold for concentration paired with the larger size of the progression, gives room for accessory exercises that you might not do otherwise: side planks can be done during holds, or handstands during core. In a sequence's case, the strictness of it holds little opportunity for new additions. Whether the early day holds this kind of session, or you merely do a vinyasa, a brief portion of flow to begin the day and rest to end it makes our training enough. Those are the truths of physical health.
            <br>&emsp;Food wise, the truths are more crucial yet acceptable to loosely define. Fundamentally you don't want to eat early or very late, and that starches and carbs are best for the latter part of the day. Secondly, is that lighter foods ought not be had following heavy ones; so rice should not follow potatoes nor should figs follow rice. Giving yourself more freedom to eat the same fruits and vegetables during the day can give you assurance and ease towards reaching the sustenance of the evening. Moreso, does edamame come into fruition as a welcomed protein source -if your training is more prevalent. Thirdly, and perhaps the most misunderstood, is that momentary nutrition fairs different than your baseline response. If you go for a sprint then your body ought to refuel from such exertion. If you hadn't trained for two weeks prior, then the baseline needs would be small. "So much time has gone by where we failed to make this distinction." And its point does not rest so much on what momentary choices you should make, rather that you should keep your baseline in mind. As it stands, when it is small(or lower rather) then grains are favorable compared to starches -as the latter surpasses your needs too quickly. When your training and corresponding needs increase, so does starches and proteins relevance -as well as the lowered ease by which dried fruit is had. Bread too loses its place as your body needs more; for just as potatoes fair little compared to barely and quinoa when your training little, so does bread get pushed out when potatoes come in -when your training is more, and less doughs required, but fuel. Keeping this in mind and having your sense of right and wrong tuned by this direction will see that your principal strength becomes both effective and simple. "For you can say which grains and starches to have, and when, as well as whether produce and dried fruit is appropriate or necessary -for we may bet better off in having more sustenance rather than ruffage."
            <br>&emsp;In terms of interest then, I have little. This is due to the cold admittedly, but our response is also creatively fatal. As I see it, what is good is that which allows you to continually do what is positive. In other words, an action will produce subsequence use if it is fitting; so if we read and enjoy it, we'll read more or if we are playing a game, so will our experience with it stack our investment. Whereas, it seems to be hard getting into things when we are at a standstill. This is no consequence of how drawn we are, or how worthwhile things tend to be, rather we break our movements by sleeping in, training irregularly and eating poorly. Typically, we rebound back to a freshened state but our actions are diminished; interest thus wanes and our care for things has to be redrawn. "This is a core reason for not acting poorly, as it prevents the presence and or advancement through alternatively favorable routes."
            <br>&emsp;Principally, our wish is to live well, and this aim rises above the applicable things; if we fail at some course of action, and miss them, it is really our resolve to live well in the first place that remains, not our effective place within the action. In that sense, our hopes and wishes to do more with the efforts that we have, are really remarks that come from points in which we are no longer engaged. "When we are participating in something, I care not where we'll go. Yet, when my position wanes, and I feel empty upon the initial point of return, I conjure images of how I can greater proceed. This merely reflects our fear of being outside the state, and its then hasty resolve to return." This sense then that we will fall from grace is not to be amended by making the heights higher; rather, you must become more ordained to the value of living, and deliberate with that as your scale. "That all goods and reason are set within the measures in how they pertain to that desired experience." To me, the specifics only come naturally, in that you think about how you are going to do more, rather than how you will begin. "For the former amounts to current additions, whilst the latter sees larger foundations for a higher aim. The more you get there though the lesser the heights and structure are needed; and consequently, does your planning elsewhere take you away from the point in which living would be in place, and thus you fall again." Simply assent to that more approachable point as the position that you want to be and let it flower and bloom, rather than trying to get far ahead by getting part way to some further end. "For that clearly reflects the view from someone fleeing from their idling doom."
        </div>
        <div id="innerweaving">
            Since our aim is to live, and this amounts to enjoyment, then the means to this(or nourishment rather) holds the bulk of truths. That is, what is fairly correct is that which truly brings out our objective. For example, in Buddhism, the goal is Moksha, as a state, a Samadi, the central mean by virtue of ending rebirth and karma. “The truths then are routed towards the removal of contrasts to our aim, and the saturation of what is good for them.” In the Buddhist case, Dukkha and Samadya are removed by Niroda, and its cultivated path of Magga. Upon finishing this, one quenches all their negative hunger; Nirvana is this cleanse, while Moksha is the prevailing state. In our case then, we could say that accurate assessment of what affects us dearly, embeds itself as the means towards flourishing, prosperity and tranquility. That is our Moksha, and the confidence we have and respect that follows are the positive signs of progress: our Nirvana. The baser truths though say that one must only confess their aim of living; the struggle is that admitting that you are in fact not, leaves you feeling suspended and at the mercy of all to come. “For you are not trying to get to some place, but rather become someone. And in that case, it is only more clear that you are currently not.” I would say though that the positive encasing that this admission brings, is genuine sensibility; for in our world, environments and scenarios present themselves to us, that would otherwise leave us principally free to engage with the world openly. These tasks though are natural and fair, only we must respond to them both effectively and maturely -and thus be honest and wise.
            <br>&emsp;The Second rule on top of the core interest of living, is that upon taking more time and care will our tasks be handled more effectively, done so as they are needed as opposed to fretting over or striving towards some further place; consequently, your are left with some actual good, in that you are lightened from your gratitude and strength, as well as plumped up from the active experience that follows. Regularity of this brings more confidence that it can be achieved, assurance that it is the right thing to do, satisfaction with what you have reached or are currently in, as well as anticipating what else will come -and therein what else you are willing to do as a means for it. The result that blossoms on top of this is our Moksha, a realm of imperial bliss and charming joy. “Nothing but the edge of this could see such righteous grandeur and beauty; for if you are out of this then you are merely elsewhere aligned.” For it is natural for one to be hopeful, composed, satisfied and unapprehensive when their situation is in harmony with them; that is, the demands are in check and the benefits are known. “More on each end is welcomed and looked forward to.”
            <br>&emsp;This is all baked with sensibility. That is, we are imbuing ourselves with a structure that innately responds to its aim of achieving Moksha, or joy rather. Because our place is with things, and of the actionable kind, then our experience will be determined by how we participate in the field that holds these moments of engagement. Specifics are hard though for we commonly find ourselves on that side of things as we are making judgments about them. Instead, we are better to sit with ourselves, being both valued and sensible in how we are best to proceed. In that way, we are more calibrated and confident from being so, whereupon the success that marks the proper achievement of where our mind and aims are set, reinforces the objective and our means of acquiring it. I think this contrasts Buddhism in the fact that we are more aware that there are things. And perhaps I am so focused on my highlights, but reading, personal study, training, eating well, great films and leisure, the scenes of the world, are not draining experiences; rather, they fill you up like a pump who grows upon being squeezed. In that, we gain everything when we do activities of this sort for they act moreso as vessels for us to contribute. “Whereas the Buddhist concern is in rearranging ourselves away from things in which we hope to be given something by.” We on the other hand are looking for and happy with things that we can throw ourselves into.
            <br>&emsp;Our eschatology then comes from the sensibility that this positive aim comes with; in that case, we merely see that we are going to die, the end of which will be a tranquil rest. Not only do we see this as fair, for we could not otherwise live, but in being so we actually welcome it and thus despair not, and enjoy the leading time as it is. “As we are in life, a dreamless sleep is graced upon us. Onto the end of all our living, will such rest be equally seen.” Now, our epistemology is rooted in the innate nature that we have heralded for millennia. That is, we came from monkeys to man, yet the latter is subject to Gods rather than himself. This is because we are aware of all but acting on it little. “As if the results from reason don’t make the lense.” Because of that, we are effectively monkeys with the abilities and familiarity of man. Yet we have not made mature uses of them. What we know then is that we are merely trying to live. And to fill in my own gaps, would I say that a chimp actually fairs comparable to us in terms of how its experience is dealt. Sex to it is pleasurable, and by its place in the jungle is idleness never close. Moreso is it likely warm by virtue of its compatibility with the canopy and warm environment. Just as we are well of in certain areas, or making up for it with technology, so is the monkey in its own congenial habitat. There are dangers though, and surviving is miles deeper than our own simple walk to the store.  
            <br>&emsp;The point, is that our needs being met are no different than that of some other. We happen to find it easier to achieve baser things than anything else though, but here an important point arrives. What does one do when their roots are in actual doing, yet there is no need for them to survive? They become idle, restless, stuck with responsive tradition, or otherwise gluttonous and avaricious. In a way then, we are trying to live when the ask to do so is not placed on us, rather we make it ourselves. For me, the heart of this is just as we gain little for moments of sex, so does the monkey. And admittedly its everyday life bears some pleasure, or satisfaction at least seeing as it is well off and engaged with its environment, yet I don’t believe that it is flourishing, or imbued with joy and rest. I am sure a monkey is in most ways senseless or on alert, or with pleasure otherwise. However, the latter comes just as it goes, the second arises almost to its despair, and the former marks that its life is not so full of living: for its lack of industry, intellect, admiration and care, render it contrary to generous and full living, and instead it is more passive. To be clear though, I think the monkeys passing time is more satisfying than ours because it is still generally active in the jungle. I just don’t think it extends beyond this in any significant way.  
            <br>&emsp;We on the other hand, have little interest or time to meddle, for the environment is already taken care of; moreso is the nature of the land around us one that becomes rather sequestered and hollow. This is why we bend towards those pleasures, or in some cases run towards danger and risk, or otherwise seek adventure. The problem is that these are aims for the world to happen to us. “Let there be fun, challenge or some new place abroad. These don’t fill us up though, as once they are done we simply want more.” The key issue is not that these activities are poor in how you feel; rather, their profit is not one where similarly good feelings follow. The novelty wears off, desires continue, and exclusion of other goods generally fall into place. I know this is true by the simplest of recognition. I need to convince you not that rest and contentment are superior to restlessness and contentment. Only, we must be careful and considerate as to how things bring these qualities of us out. We know that things are going to happen, and that seeing as our past is banked upon this that we are in most ways congenial to things happening at all. Better said, if nothing happens we will become idle; and as a poor feeling itself we will be driven to find life elsewhere. “And this response usually has its own perils and shortcomings.”  
            <br>&emsp;What I can measure and assess is the deepness of my breath; I cannot say what breath necessarily is and thus mark out all the spots in which it could be, matching then where my current state aligns; rather I can fairly recognize good from strong breathing, just as I can for good and bad sleep. Simply, there is a subjective element that need not be further confessed, only admitted to as the measure. That is, if I am at peace and rest, then the physiology and fundamental philosophy that accompanies this is not crucial to test. Stress though, and injury in clear cases, has more objective measures -in hormones and visibility. The point though, is that what we are looking for is that experience we deem well. Ontologically we are opposed to intervention; moreso, is our providence one that is ubiquitous in the elements, and natural in the form. Conclusively, we will fret and fry or live and die, that latter being so for the former has their eyes closed. I only subject it based on our viewing experience. “I’ll be there for death”.  
            <br>&emsp;I only then mean to remove the presumption that this course of ours is resoundingly true, and is otherwise a universal scale. I fair not in this case. Rather, I see myself and am content with the days that I have only known, becoming more in line with that experience of satisfaction and rest, as opposed to distress and boredom. To me, these are our foundational measures. For even if we do not otherwise know, we can say that there is nothing else to suggest -seeing as intervention, fairness of death, ostentation and a deep breath appear sound in our regards. The game is hard to explain, for it is in many ways made up, or ignored as the traditional response which it truly reflects. The strategy and tactics though are not clearly the aim to better; rather the ends of our play and what we experience is what we are better to address. “For the equipment we use, attitude that we bring, training we employ and efforts we produce, will bring us towards a more suitable and amendable state of victorious regularity. And one suitable to us too.”

        <div id="closingstep">
            As it stands, there are four primary truths. In total, they amount to what’s good, as do their negations reflect the bad; moreso, does the absence of the former suggest the latter, as does the absence of the latter provide the former. “Would a lack of wounds not describe good health? Or would a lack of health, or wholeness to our stature, not comparably suggest an illness or injury? I think so.” In any case, the four truths are as follows. One, is we ought to be void of doubts and scrutiny over our actions. “I wish not to eat or train, for example, in a way that makes me anxious about the results which follow.” Here the second truth arrives, in that we should be confident in what we do. “What will come I do not know, but practically speaking I am reassured by the good in what we are doing; at the very least these actions are what I can stand by.” This truth readily thrives on reflection and resolve, as we give insight into what has worked and what in absence equally does so. In that way, if we are good then we can be happy that our path will continue; or if we are poor, then we can at least feel bolstered by the better aim that were trying for. These more or less make the back end of truths.
            <br>&emsp;On the front, the third truth is that we ought to anticipate what we are doing. Looking at what those nourishing truths offer, we can see how their provision is best when our ends are ones that excite us to arrive at. “We ought to write and feel drawn to do more. It’s not the case that things should be banked upon, nor should outcomes and fortune linger in our mind, but onto what we have done so far that we find respectable and confirming, so too will more of it be welcome.” Lastly, and where this blossoms, is that our activity is one we enjoy. Simply, the measure of our lives is that the components are pleasing to us; consequently, will we anticipate more of them and feel confident if our means toward them are sound; nor will we feel absent if the errors against this are avoided. Buddhism in comparison, has ignorance, suffering and rebirth, each of which unite to form the whole. Each element though is a portion of truth, or a piece rather onto that unison. In our case here, it is the stitching of aversion, amendment, disposition and reward that come together to form the good. Corresponding to that, are the elements that come to be in the absence of these parts. To be clear though, that these are not things in and of themselves, rather subjects within our discourse that describe the voids left by the absence of those better (and truer)pieces. In that, will a lack of sensibility to what would be bad, leave you with cluelessness and frivolity. “As if you don’t even know that you are suffering.” On top of that, will a lack of principle and self respect leave you with a mixture of doubts and uncertainty. “As if your reasoning for acting how you do, is not one that you’d stand by, as what it suggests is not commendable.” Furthermore, will your disposition drag you away from anticipation. For one, your ignorance will not prevail by virtue of its ineffective nature; two however, is that awareness that you are poorly kept and defined will only reveal that the end is not one to look forward to. “The steps that you now see, are towards an end which is not desirable.” Foremost though, is the presence of frailty and discontent. This is the hardest thing to reproach from, since if you are moving away, then your view from the bottom only reveals how far away the top is. “That is why people stay ignorant: for if they only knew how lackluster their experience was, oh how troubling that would be.”
            <br>&emsp;All that being said, it is important to note that these truths are not qualifications for things. Rather, they are embodiments of how we are intrinsically. That isn’t to say that things don’t affect us, but that happiness is a point to reach, or thing to have, as is restlessness a thing to avoid or place to refrain, is not true. Instead, these are arrangements of ourselves. And I should be clear that the configuration is found through things, as our expectation of some event may be gently ingrained to us and leave us thus with contentment, or we may cling to it and becomes apprehensive. The point is, just as deep and shallow breaths are descriptions of ourselves rather than the ways of air and oxygen, so too will gluttony and savasana serve as inputs to our vessel, of which happiness and its negation are states of the mold. That is the crucial thing to know, for despite the resting end, so too does our living state benefit from a generous scale for judgment. That, is then onto the subject of application; whereupon learning the truth, we address how we’ll live. “And the results of that which are most positive are those by which the proper scale is credited.” Place yourself before ignorance then, and remove all assumptions of what you need and simply ask what you require: is it not that state of your vessel being void of rugged proclivities, and full of righteous ones instead? I feel like our need for more is strictly because we have not clarified that what we seek is that: for which the scales of good are made.”

        <div id="aman">
            To expect and regret something is to refer to some measure of truth. Good or bad refers to our assessment right now, of some factor or thing. However, these estimates are really based on what we are naturally inclined or averse towards. For example, we bring our hands away from the fire as our innate tendency is to avoid it; however, if the perils of hell upon death must be particularly amended to in order to avoid, then so would our nature’s wish to fall in line. To be clear, we are not comparing impulse and higher thought. Rather, we can know for example that eating heavily before bed is unfavorable in a nourishing and thus rewarding sense. Basic thought and awareness reveal this as true. It is merely a personal truth though, whereas objective truths reflect the frameworks above us; this amounts to ends and consequences which we could not effectively anticipate. “Unless we use reasoning.”
            <br>&emsp;People have responded in this sense and forged pernicious systems of divine promise and benevolence; simply though, their conclusions are wrong. Foremost, is that their truths are merely composed of air weaving; that is, compared to stitching linens whose fibers come together strong under the needle, our religious sentiments are like arranging abstract ideas and possibilities. Better said is the heart of it purely deductive, as if there are musts, rather than the points being sound and likely. The attempt though is not foolhardy, as a simple line of regress does bring you to ponder an origin, and therein where it is to. The practical mistake is our fallibility in configuring the parts that we get from such inquiry. “You do not know the true origin of the universe, nor can you even regard its complexity and principal nature. Moreso can you not account for it on the whole scale, and thus your place within it.” Better said, our view of objective truths are in error due to their certain completion. “As a man who is reasonable and mature, these weavings of ideas and concepts into floating frameworks bear little truth nor use for me. I am only seeking to be happy as nature has ordained. In that, ought my reasoning for things rest neat and tidy beside me, rather than trying to paint the world. The outside scenery will do instead.” That is what I need to explain.
            <br>&emsp;This concludes it for me. As a man, I am unsure. What a man is though, is one who seeks rest and freedom, and avoids idol discontent. These are not values any more than gun shots are an aversion -or as air is preferable. “The elements of me are what define me; and as my bones fair poorly when broken, so does my mind when it is drenched with sugar and crumby thinking. And so forth.” The interesting thing then, is that if these peculiarities innate to me amount to the quality of living, then our formative response(as opposed to earlier impulsive ones) is to ardently consider, resolve and compose ourselves in a relevant way so that our environment is in harmony with us. We seek food because we need it, just as there is heartfelt security from a friend. So to do we avoid dark alleys for the fear of a mugging, and otherwise act respectful in public. The crux of our mindset is in the following addition. It is easy to demonstrate our nature through examples that show our core aversions. That is, where we run away from and avoid clearly illustrates something about us. What is more difficult to explain is why we would choose to study in school, as if remaining safe from predators garnished similar attention and care as being employed. This is the point to explain.
            <br>&emsp;As I see it, where we must come in line is in understanding that what makes a high career good or a sensible action or reservation prudent, is not something we must choose to desire or like. Rather, the results of these are goods that we innately find favorable. The issue though, is that rest and contentment come from forward actions, whereas the aversion and fear of tigers and snakes are responsive. The crucial strand of our reasoning though, is that the values for each equally mark the man, and thus his nature. “Fresh health and a clear mind are definitively equal as preservation of air and an interest of sex, in regards to our core tendency.” A useful parallel to this is that mention of virtue and vice, in that on neither side do all actions amount to the same in severity, yet within each are things strictly one or the other; they say then that although cheating on your wife is quite poor, and that however worse murdering is when it comes to being bad, that badness should be seen as consistently poor regardless of a particulars strength. That is it more or less. In that sense, we can see how preference, skill, prominence and interest vary when it comes to our core proclivities; but we should equate them equally ‘as perclivites’ regardless of how their individual ‘peculiaritieness’ is. “A domain explains this nicely, that joy and self respect fit within the same range as frivolity and trauma. Where they differ is in their color and saturation; as elements though, or items rather, they all fit the line of what defines us. And as that marks our nature, so too would our deliberate regard or measured response relate to the subject or maker that we are.”
            <br>&emsp;This could not be more important to know, for it removes the need for an objective measure; as our nature clearly is defined besides the need for it. To our benefit then, we can paint. “But as painters though, happily, rather than those who must know if they can, and in effect doubt whether their sense that they can is correct, or otherwise that their work must be submitted and in(that) effect, alter the creations we mean to make and thus what we feel compelled to or at liberty to see.” My own nature reveals to me that these are clouds of exhaust coming from our pipes of reason; the road is ahead though and, in driving, there’s fairness, pleasure and care from all that I see. And are those fumes not a result for the sake of those? Moreso, should my objective then be to grab all the smoke, ‘or put my foot on the pedal’? Perhaps the purpose of those former is to prevent the drunk driving that we see. “If there were no laws against this though, wouldn’t reason still carry you to drive sober, so that you could see.”

        <div id="embers">
            I’d like to dedicate these thoughts to Plutarch, whose illustrative aims and power reflect my own, to which I am grateful and with comfort. As he has said, disposition molds life; that is, it is the foot that bends with the shoe. As I see it, we are bowls, spheres, vessels if you will. If left unattended, then the walls will close in, increasing the pressure by which troubles and concerns exist. Consequently, are they more likely to ignite: the result being hot headedness. “And, as they say, such hot heads are not actually big ones. Rather they are small, where problems easily bounce around.” On the flip side, if our borders are more expanded, then incoming affairs can float around more easily and freely. In effect, they will either not become inflamed and thus act as deeds rather than burdens, or if they do spark up the flame will be at most mild. “That is why, in contrast, we can say that those who are well-tempered are so because they have the space to fit everything.” Now, there is a point of wisdom for each side. On the part of intolerance, we can say that removing issues in the first place will remove the required embers for heat; note however that problems will always arise, so long as the world and you remain. It’s not that we can’t become more sensible and become less intruded, or be longing for things whose absence equally stirs us up, ‘but never will the bowl be empty’. To me, it feels like a strict condition that the vessel be attended to, otherwise, the expected instances of intrusion will necessarily burn. There is another related point as to the relief caused by a larger bowl, but we’ll come to back to that shortly.
            <br>&emsp;With our small enclosure in mind -with all the animals in the pen bumping around- we can see clearly that the walls should be extended. This is quite simple mind you, though those prone to or in a state of heatedness tend not to see the greens around. Nevertheless, as in most discourse, we are discussing things as if they were something we would in fact address, or otherwise do. And I can say a great deal about what will specifically widen your foundations, but I will subsist by merely being formulaic about it. That is, what is good(we’ll say) is that which gives you a bigger bowl -or a suitable one at least. This, as we said, is to remove the proclivity for ignition, as well as allowing for concerns to rest easily within you. The good then will allow you to sit with troubles with more ease, and solve them in a more able minded fashion. In contrast to that, will the bad be that which results in a smaller bowl; gluttony tends to do this actively, while ignorance or shortness when it comes to fruitful activities serves you the same(by virtue of their absence).
            <br>&emsp;What these activities of good and bad are, I will not for the moment say. It is not that I have little sense or suspicion, only that the discourse here relies on either an objective measure, or approach at least towards it -that being an account for what is right and wrong. For now, I am simply suggesting what outcomes we would want, as to establish our value, and letting the student and or person assess what activities and resolutions seem to fit that. In other words, you may say what things are good or bad based on the experience you have. What I am saying in a more forward sense is what results we will say are poor and which are favorable. “And, definitively, goods bring out the latter while the bad draws the former.” I will assume these values, and by virtue of our bowl illustration assume that the heart of it is worth agreeing upon: to which things you do specifically, that can be up to you.
            <div class="qu">Take this scale, I recommend it be yours. What we should measure though, that is less clear. Through our inquiry though we can better know -as our reflections and care demonstrate- but only to a likely objective end. Because of that, I only invite you into these talks regarding things and definitive measures if you are fine to be suspended and suggestive when it comes to what things we actually do. However, besides right and wrong, we can still use a scale of good and bad. For none can tell us that irksomeness and hot tempers are worthwhile, while rest, satisfaction and joy deserve avoidance.”</div>
            Another important point is in regards to the goods that come from the bowl. As we said, if the walls are close together, then the elements of our lives will feel compressed, and thus ignite. Moreover, does the likely accompanying stiffness of these fumes exasperate the problem. If the bowl is large though, two things happen. One, as we said, is that troubles and concerns have more room to mozy around, and thus become less prone to ignition, and with less severity when they in fact do. Secondly though, and to the good, is that this increased area allows for positive elements to cultivate. Interests, inquiries, personal care, the removal needing prospects, the introduction of ostensibility etc., these ideas and cares will have the room and freedom to assemble themselves into light yet hearty things. “For they have less scruff and gruff dragging them down; or in other words, there are less sparks of avarice and spite putting out the embers of good and green.”
            <br>&emsp;Two things regarding this. One, is that the removal of inflammation makes the birthing grounds for these things more welcoming and fruitful, which gives us the benefit of being void of negation and full of promise. Secondly, is that the growth of those goods carry the enclosure as to keep it ripe and plenty. A useful example would be how air underneath a tarp lifts it. Now, in the case of these goods, their evenness increasingly spreads across these greater grounds, and upon becoming more solid and ingrained, firm the walls themselves as to keep them from pillowing in, as well as giving them that fluffing effect, wherein their own milder heats and pleasure give the enclosure a blossoming effect. “As a cloud remains solid and whole, yet through its lightness pillows over.”  
            <br>&emsp;Altogether, this is a mere illustration. It is a useful one though, as we can see that it is really we who determine the results. That simply being the case because we are the ones who take things in; as there are elements that offer, and thus our ‘bowl’ so to speak, will tilt our ends as being compressed and inflamed, or evenly fresh and stable. “Thus, a hard brittleness is no measure of strength: we seek a more robust and virile firmness and solidity.”
        </div>
        <div id="ends">
            How we feel right now is worth reflecting along with the course of our lives. The former may in fact just need some tender love and care, while the latter could simply bring its light into further fruition. As for the present, I am fairing well with our interests and duty; though, the nature of this can bring me into a point of immediacy, 'as good becomes subpar to greatness'. It's important to remember though that feeling average is best compensated for by taking careful accounts of why you fell short in the first place - and then what you are going to do. And to that latter, I could say that keeping yourself active and accordingly fed in between strength sessions is a means of regulation, while returning to an aerobic state is otherwise crucial before resistance can be attempted -if and when you faltered. This will hopefully keep me in line. My attention though is fairly placed on what lies further ahead. As we refurbish ourselves from that lower state and make a resolve to become more effective, the larger path ahead becomes intriguing. Down that road we can see our parents leaving from early April to mid June, followed by another month long trip from the end of August to the middle of September. Then, though are edge here is marked, is a substantially longer trip in the early spring of next year. This seems all good and done. "And I am happy to rest with it as our course, rather than plan what will happen during or after: as what follows will more or less be the same. Thus my minds eye can fear not, and settle, to me."
            <br>&emsp;As for our life, our time and days are one thing, but our happiness is the other. For the former, we are graced with a trough of games, shows, films, creators, books, study, principal and noble resolve. This is pleasing, and respectful. Regarding our general lives though, my core is slipping. Admittedly, this can be explained by our solitary state unfolding as we become more apt and pure personally, and considering this it is clear that any slips in that stead are likely to reveal the wares of such solitude; but the potential of which the line at heart has yet to fully reach, that describes the answer. That is, we can see that there is a great deal to do; moreso, can the baseline of what we are required to meet as well as what we are given, is ample and increasing. Where the struggle comes in is that I have no plan for my life. The course is good, as is our every moment in place: it is merely the road that lacks a wheel, and by those moments where the joy is lowered, does my lack of grip become apparent. "For that is how I wish to live, as it seems the best in an admirable sense, of taking increasingly great steps, and letting that bring me to advancement." The core issue though is that our anticipations are waining due to a lack of real expectations. For our ends born from self importance and fantasy have been shed off, yet nothing has really replaced them. In that sense I can see where I am. And even though all the poorness has been removed as well as the aims which it purported, only the good in contrast has become fully placed: the according aims though need some development.
            <br>&emsp;On the whole of it I see so much interest and green in our righteous study. That is, like a painter who skillfully knows the world, are my own efforts similar. "Both in the care and keenness to the beauty I see, as well as the priviness to and ability with the craft that allows for an effective display." In that, has an all encompassing approach towards the mightiest of inquiries lit my way. "And what I mean is to give it the proper depth, as what I see must be respectfully drawn." The truth, is that what I see in those things which inspired me, as well as the end portrait itself, is where the reward lies. "The drawing and or painting otherwise, is merely peeling the fruit." A not unimportant note is that these paths are banked on regularity; and seeing as what I have to say is sought for based on interest as opposed to opportunity, then the abundance in which I mean to contribute marks a path which is not so casually begun. For I do wish people to see it as to draw out the value of the work; moreso, do I wish for others to be involved, so each element can be expanded upon its viable mold for tribute, as well as furthering the array of parts which we can be generous too in the first place.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, this path marks the route of me becoming the greatest version of myself. It is a massive line though, rather than a single figure which fairs well with occasional additions. For two reasons then should our resolve be contained. One, is that I am currently on my own and with more personal concerns. I love Middle Earth, but my place at home is to write about it rather than form a video -or wide production rather. This is partially explained by the fact that our civil scenario is one where the time is spent mostly walking or at home. As the sun rises so do we, not to some audience or crowd. And so, for one, these elements of abundant construction are secondary; which in itself fairly suggests that what is primary is a priority. Secondly though, is that my intent upon these is one that banks itself on regularity and growth. In that sense, I mean to go to war, rather than win a current battle. And with the current fight were in being one of personal interests and cares, then no lasting conquest is on the table. And that is the main point, that our present place in life is one where we are solidifying our core selves. "Therein, is our time more private and locally industrious, rather than being directed onto the world." Our base is all we have and in turn where we live. I don't have the troops nor the machinery to encompass the land, or achieve any significant victory for that matter. In other words, unless we actually win the war, then our return home will only see us wishing to return to battle. And for me, the more favorable choice is one where we continue forever, rather than retreating home.
            <br>&emsp;That isn't to say that these efforts will have to yield me with riches in splendor, no. "Their aim is reflected in what I actually mean to do, the living and tribute of which is the compensation." And to be clear then, that blogging, YouTubing, programming etc., are not poor choices in terms of what one wants to do, or what they could receive. What I wish to achieve though is a brilliant end, one of which amounts to an accomplishment: for I generously lived. Therefore, as that path is one where my consistency and care will be placed, then no other path which required the same will be acceptable. "For in those cases, not but that kind of commitment will yield a reward; and seeing as though for any path that the end is one with no finish in sight, then we ought to prioritize which one(under those conditions) we'd choose. And if the one which you see yourself sticking to is not one you can suitably begin right now, then simply keep it in mind." The course of which, will see our good sprout and extend. From us though will this happen, by which our current attention is merely onto the seed. "In which our life and nature will simply grow to our bettering end: for we are letting it happen."
        </div>

        <div id="virtue">
            Since we are alive, living seems to be the mold for our aim. That is, in a redundant way, that all ends are so if life is actually gained. A useful metric for this is joy. Rather, if we wish for our lives to be full of rest, satisfaction, contentment, excitement, curiosity, friendship and care, then we can say this is so for we enjoy these things. Opposed to that are those things which bring little joy, such as trauma, idleness, frailty and stress. Herein, will joy be our measure. Moreover, can we say something is good because we enjoy it; as well, can a lack of things which would otherwise be unenjoyable also be considered good. This is why they say then, that good and bad is found in ourselves rather than things. "As a long line causes trouble to one and nothing to another. The patience that composes that latter can be said to be good as it is favorable towards maintaining enjoyment." In that sense, we could say that what is good are those things which we enjoy; however, this must be colored with a touch of maturity, as a lack of character and understanding will not procure and desired results. To refine then, we can say that if joy is our sought for experience, then achieving this readily and smoothly carries more value. Therefore, will things that we enjoy momentarily but at the expense of others, be seen as minor goods, as their joy is also so. Seeing as we are placed within a condition that tells us to adhere to it through a certain way, then we can say that only those things which sufficiently abide and the otherwise select interests that fit with these harmoniously, mark any merit in being an eligible claim. I would point out in addition, that those goods aside from those within responsibility are soundly so if they work in unison with those demands; that is, that our more creative and leisurely interests sprout from the grounds in which we are ordained to, as well as being either supportive or encouraging for those lower tasks. In short, there are things we have to do and things we want to do, and in terms of why we have to do those former ought it be so we can provide for those latter; and these latter should be staked as if they were rooted from the offerings of the former, and, like a seed which gets carried to some adjacent place, 're-nourishes the ground and soil by which its origins were made'. As a complete picture then, we will say that goods are only so if they fit to this model; otherwise they will be seen as lesser, or of a lower kind -such as a full count of half goodness.
            <br>&emsp;Within this framework there are two sides: nourishment and reward. The former reflects the amendment to our condition so we may be present and thrive. The latter in contrast, marks the reason for committing to such demands, as we are given something that we seek. "Compensation more or less." Now, each can be regarded in one of two ways. In terms of our means, they can be central and of duty, wherein we abide by the law, act civil, shower, maintain our health etc. The other side is one where we develop skills, the ability for craft or mind for design and formation. In that, do higher interests at the front require their own particular means to enact them(such as skills as drafting); whereas those baser needs are merely in place for us to survive. On the flipside are what we get from what we do. And to be clear, that this end may in fact involve more doing, but of a preferable sort. "For example, if I am playing a game, my aim may in fact be to win, yet through my humble and better ways would the simple act of playing satisfy enough, rather than requiring the trophy upon completion." To be clear though as mentioned, there are two sorts of compensation. One, is a profit. In a specific sense this merely refers to the removal of friction for interest elsewhere; this may be for direct advancements towards some other end, or may simply remove the amount of core responsibility that you need to have, or otherwise soften the efforts required to lift the same load. Secondly are rewards. These are what we strive for the most, 'as we feel the best when the feelings are of this kind'. Profits are pleasing, but their heart and core is in what you can more easily do; it those highest things that reward us, and thus is where our furthest ends are placed. "For this end holds the things which we find rewarding, making the spot foremost." To connect a few dots, we can confidently say that these rewards usually come from efforts or activities where you are genuinely involved. "If your mind is elsewhere because something else feels more important, then that clearly describes this current place. If your doing something though that you have no interest or mind for somewhere else, then we can say it is rewarding for it is clearly pleasing in itself." In that case though, would this activity likely have its own kind of requirements; if it were some craft then the appropriate skills would be needed, or if it was some grand plan for producing an abundance of creation, then prior design and formation would also be necessary. These are at the back though, for even if they are baser efforts for works of a higher kind, they are still means. "In that we call them nourishing, simply higher than paying checks or doing remedial tasks."
            <br>&emsp;Adding to this, I will say that when it comes to the array of specific tasks and rewards, that the back is typcially more dense and concentrated, whereas the front end activities vary in what they offer and demand. "For writing books and fiction fairs differently in the genuine amount and quality than playing sports or driving cars. In that, despite residing within the same league of interest and rewards, the details for each reveals what they truly amount to. In that sense, these things are all definitively rewarding, but to what extent and by which credible means, is where they vary." Moreover then, do we use this sentiment to distinguish between average and higher goods. "As a brief sprint of a car is effectively lesser than an evening sunset with books or a friend." Even though the former has a higher high, so mine has a wider low. And when comparing the two, you can see how one is merely a knife whose point stretches a bit longer; while mine, being admittedly long and sharp though comparatively less, has a more wholesome and firmer base. And to me personally, that is the reward that my nourishment is banked on.

            I'd like to talk about principle aspects. We have said that an objective measure is hard. It is not too difficult though for two reasons. First, is that a local principal is generally sufficient in that locale. That is, if we are cooking we ought to do so well, as the contrary however devoid from the foremost measure, is by itself clear with respect to this situation. Secondly, is that reason, or rather what our senses confer as being relevant to us, takes situations and their corresponding aspects and tells us which of them are essential. Breathing, water, sensibility etc., all appear as necessary for us to be, and henceforth require no further understanding. "For we may be better off in having that measure as we may consequently achieve more, but being as we are in the first place has no detriment in remaining so." This arranges itself nicely in the first place, as the scenarios which are relevant show their relative principles. "If one were to choose cherry over grapefruit juice, then we could more simply ask as to the point of juice in general. If it were health, then either would be more clear as they pertained to that value, or it may simply negate them. Or, if it were based on drinking fluids, then each would be assessed equally; though, other considerations would still be in place likely, otherwise the choice would literally be the same." In that way, we can look at what it is we need to do, and simply respect what is true based on the situation of that. "If we are best to do some action, then the nature of that action is where we will amend to, rather than nature herself -for the truth of her we cannot know."
            <br>&emsp;Personally, I find that fitness and nutrition offer the most when we explain their principles. For both our need to do these in some way, as well as our apparent frequency in doing them nonetheless, suggests that there will be more profit and good if we understand them at their core. I will be brief. Fitness, accounts for walking, running, sitting, standing, jumping and bracing. At the core of this is our propensity to wish to move, and feel poor if we don't. It seems though that action in these cases will just naturally happen; my belief though is that opposing forces can bring us down. Chairs, beds, inactivity from life's build or other select choices(such as food) dries our nature up. "Where if a burglar broke in or a tiger was after us, so would we be capable. But only by prompt would we do these things, rather than it being something we commonly do." And I would say that having this as our nature is the most rewarding, as we are able to watch, think, dream and know. Moreover, would the rest and fulfillment that came as offers from such ability, best describes how we are happiest being, and thus what is good for us to do -as it provides us something rewarding -or a means at least. As a resolve then, I would say that containing your nature of activity is good, and that refining it is merely of excellence. Nutrition fits in here nicely as well, as her place is meant for the same and banked equally as a worthwhile thing to uphold. To note, that the pleasure one gets from these things in themselves, such as the fresh feeling from running or the satiation from eating, ought not remove the advantage and or point by which the principles of these are staked upon. "Enjoy your days and dinner, but not so much that you are too full to live otherwise."
            <br>&emsp;Specifically though, we can say that what is good for exercise is that which allows for it to persist and bring the rewards. For me, Hatha is what permits this. Simply, it roots us into the ground and imbibes us with gentle strength. Effectively, we are able to be still as well as grounded enough to produce powerful movement. From that, will motions be carried out in a way that more can follow -because they firm themselves in by virtue of the practice being substantial. As well, will the time between not wear us away, as we are steady and true in our rest and preparations. "Here, will the steps we've gained not fall away, as we hold the progress and prime ourselves for more." The principle of fitness then is the lasting abiliy to do it; both in terms of allowing for our natural ability and interests to run their course, as well as defending against any withering away or friction in being productive. "Our root is solid when its base cannot crumble, as well as letting the body blossom and expand -without retreating or imploding mind you."
            <br>&emsp;Practically speaking, the unit of measure here is our breath, as it marks our means of assembly and demonstration. In effect, we gain the most from breathing through the exercises as well as during transitions(for Hatha that is). However, when we do such training is besides that point, as the method of breathing still remains as good beyond our completion of the activity. So, building on that, can we say that stability and recovery expressions through this breathing method will produce the strongest Hathic effect -and thus the principal good for our active nature to flow through. How much you do is not so important, rather that you do some at all -and well at that. Based on the time of day, as well as your sense that it ought to be done, or at most that it could be done and you were able, will see that either type be administered. In this sense, it's as if there is a casing which forever needs stitching up, as well as benefitting from additions and or affirmations. What is crucial though, is that we have the right putty, as our interest in rebuilding and improvement will reward us with efficient success, which will in itself carry us forward with more potential and further realized gains. As if we had a home and some paint, will the clarity of why the former should be treated as well as the experience and sense as to why the latter is effective, will see that we act properly as painters, and earn the sought for reward.
            <br>&emsp;Whereas fitness marks the structure by which things are done, nutrition reflects the engine so to speak, of how it is produced. "In a way, our diet saturates our means and ends, in that we infuse prominent capacities in the training as well as the activities that we are rewarded with." It follows though, that nutrition bases itself heavily on what is appropriate. Specifics aside, we are looking for a general principle. What it amounts to, is that what your body needs must be solely amended to. If it needs sugar, then this is good, or if it needs protein then that too. In effect though, as it commonly occurs, poor choices here leave the subsequent needs out of wack, where the sensibility to have or not have something is pushed aside for the momentary need that is currently best to respond to. This is no point though, rather the reality of the situation. "Principle seems even more important then, for we can at least stake ourselves towards the proper end, wherein the good is done when times are better, or we at least more happily and eventually do what is good in response to times which demand us be pernicious."
            <br>&emsp;The details are rough though as it is very difficult to know what you really need. Similarly to note, is how Hatha is not so clear why it is good and whether your body needs this in particular, or if not so some other. In that, we merely have a well founded and thought through sense. I suggest we apply ourselves equally when it comes to nutrition. In its case, the furthest remark that has sparked my attention reflects how your body has a mass state. This amounts to the kind of needs you have based on the actions of the day, only that our view of it respects the sense of what recent expressions require. Whereas the average of all expressions over a stretch of time more effectively tells what place your at. For example, if we hadn't worked out in three days, then the prominence of our need for nourishment would be low. However, if we had been working out every other day for the three weeks prior, then the base would itself be higher. Practically speaking then, you can see how a moment requires a response, as in a severe case would a marathon require a great deal of refueling and recovery. It is what you have done over time though and accumulated which determines the bulk of the matter. In effect, the higher your base needs the more you will have to intake. Whereas a low amount of needs paired with a moment of severe requirment, suggests that only that brief span be amended to -as the whole is quickly pleased.
            <br>&emsp;What we are trying to avoid is eating too much when we need too little, as well as forgoing nourishment when our baseline is higher up. Again though, the moment should be preserved, but the day not be amended to as if its needs were the same. "What is best for Monday comes from the actions that followed Monday prior; whereas the choice action for that evening is based on what you did in the earlier afternoon." This is generally a good understanding. Specifically though, will we say that starches are very filling, whereas grains have more room to grow. And neither is better or worse necessarily when it comes to the whole, only that starches will fill it up quicker. "And going over, in particular, is the harshest thing to error at." For the moments, if extreme fatigue and or resistance is expressed, ought more protein be down; and if this drain is one that marks a significant - rather than a brief moment of intensity- then the caloric burn that occurred ought to be accordingly dealt with. Smoothies, many oranges, dried fruit or bananas fit that bill of replenishing fuel. And if a moment needs none, than an orange, almonds or kale will do -with carrots, and later on a smoothie, being suitable for after portions of the day. In that sense, would an off day following a stretch of intense training see the resting portions during the day respond better to ruffage and lighter foods, whereas starch and heavier grains would still be appropriate during the evening(when we nourished the base).

        <div id="amend">
            For many years I see us living immediately. Following that, I see more control to target more long term ends. However, it is most evident that our life will not appear to have improved unless we get more from it. Naturally, the steepness of this line is fairly slight when we're on our own, but its heading is generally up. A friend though, or illegitimate impressions or praise, will bank it more quickly, as in these scenarios we are more drawn. Reaching this point is tricky. Foremost, is that if your further investment is into lower and unsustainable things, then that end will eventually fall away. On the personal end, you may otherwise find more true and genuine dealings with works and efforts of a higher kind: their attention can only receive so much from a single person though, nor is it as seemingly important as the world lays aside. Worth noting, is that there is a reasonable sense of community, seeing as we are people. Removing our aim of grandiose praise or delivery, or remedying the worries of far off acquisition, our simple efforts that merely come from ourselves can sit in both a comforted and communal state, 'as our place is already amidst the people of the world'. One way of looking at it, is if you were by yourself but saw people around, who also were doing their own unique things, then to all could confidence and security be gained, 'as during our own intrigues and work, there were others around doing the same'. At the very least, we can be confident that even in private affairs, the world proceeds around us. The point then is that good work need not be sacrificed if one is in that private case. Their strength and ability to see, will result in a dignified course of kind of conduct, as well as being pleased that their personal direction is not a deserted one. "Man is always there."
            <br>&emsp;Coming back to our issue, is in the improvement that this proper course would have if other people were directly involved. As if we were architects, does that worldly mention affirm the stability in which the worker is placed? There is only one builder though. Humanity being around however helpful and comforting, does not directly contribute or care. For that we need friends, or a genuine interest that is. And this can be tough as the kind of work that seems favorable is not one that most people lean towards. Part of me then sees that our course in life will be one where our private efforts conjure themselves as to draw others in. A friend may be found along the way, or many in fact, but the situation will be the same. For other people to care and or get practically involved, requires from one or the subsequent group to be impressive. Know however that this is only so we can throw ourselves in. By the virtues of stability, we are in most ways made, simply trying to live. In that, the works, pieces, ideas and or creations that we mean to contribute towards, require less money than time. Our efforts are ones of generosity, formation, tribute and design. And the world in which we are inspired by along with the molds we erect as a means for our treatment, only require time, attention and care. Tithe, or the income from a patron is merely additional here, as if it were more fuel for a fire that would always be lit. Helpful indeed, but were looking for more direct involvement. "Those who would actually roast weenies and mellows over the flame."
            <br>&emsp;On these sentiments I have two things to say. One, is that my venture to describe this path and its ways is merely reminiscent of my clarity onto the things that I wish to treat. Currently, we are in love with Aristotle along with great film. Games sit there too as do our roots with training for nourishment. These elements of our lives increasingly cement themselves as those things which were generous towards. And in seeing so, I am merely stating how it would be improved if there were people of a similarly generous build. That isn't to say that onto each piece that this is where that person leans, rather that they are attentive and resolute in general - regardless of the specific way. In that, I am looking to find those other people who are ordained within creative piety. "Of others who worship are what I call a friend. Neither the end though of those treatments is what matters, nor are you my enemy no less. 'It really is just about whether or not you care'." This reflects the aim of the second point, but of its route I will first expand.
            <br>&emsp;Of great importance is that we constantly adhere to ourselves. The simple reasoning is that if we had friends who liked us and we were comrades to, then being out of line with who you were in this situation would reflect 'riches of a poor kind'. That is because, for example, good words and great deeds are only worthwhile to those who can read or see them. "In that sense, would a currency from a country that did not domestically apply, be quite useless." The practice of this wabbles in the following way. One discovers the reason to live; moreso, do they imbed themselves into it and become rich with personal wealth and cheer. There's no one around though. "And more or less we could describe this predicament as one where there was no one to share the bounty or load with." So, you venture back, or into rather, ignorant lands where others reside. You say 'hey, come with me, I have something great to show you!'They may humbly oblige, but also may feel uninterested. An issue arises then that if you sought to demonstrate an example let's say, of the goodness that waits, you would likely find that there was no suitable place for this reasonable expression to be done so 'in this land of ignorance'. Therein, you may bend to the local ways, as to learn their customs. In this case, if we meant to spread the word of Jesus in a foreign country, then we would likely learn their common language as to spread our doctrines with respect to that. What you may find though with goodness is that it is easily stained by relative badness. That is to say, if you learned Chinese to share an idea through that, then the English roots in which it came from get easily swept aside. "As they say, you must avoid or imitate the crowd, for the fairs of either are lost in each end." It is worth noting though that regular exposure to reason solidifies it(so to speak) in one's bones and mind. In that, it is fair to expect that some accommodation can be made to the local ways, wherein more effective communication and display can be made regarding your own local goods.
            <br>&emsp;That is one element then, in how we are going to draw people to the land of reason. A second issue though is that just as your roots are baked within your domestic product, so are the others. And just as you maintain who you are at heart when foreign lands are approached, so will these residents of Ignoria when they land in Reasonville. That's not to say they won't care for the weather or appreciate the food, but their heart and palate is otherwise ordained. Here is the important point then. Regarding cooking, we learn local delicacies so we can fit into a new locale. In this example, we may wish to reveal ourselves as a chef, as to encourage the locals to come and try your brand of food. As a strategy, you learn to make their kind of food so that their interest is sparked onto you personally, and are then fine to see what you otherwise have. Regarding reason though, the details change. For one, this land of Rationalia is really just an assortment of thoughts and their practice. Whereas the food of an English chef is sure to satisfy the tastes of those familiar with Taiwanese, the folks of Ignoria will not so readily and happily be drawn to or oblige the goods of reason. What it requires is an impressive display. As it goes, reason provides rest and cheer; however this is hard to convey through your private affairs. Consider who we are as creatures though, and how this tempered soul and mind realizes itself as its strength becomes outwardly prominent. In the case of man, it is industry, generosity, creativity and design that comes boldly forth into fruition. "And as a mark of the character and kind that reason produces, gives much credit and appeal to those who would otherwise see it as pretension and cirfufity."
            <br>&emsp;The point then, is how this builder builds. As we said, we are going into an ignorant land, like a missionary would, and asking those besides the doctrine to come and see the good that it can do. This is a flat remark, but what have you actually so far done as to legitimize your claim 'that reason is provident?' What goods in fact have you uncovered or materialized? And to which ones that you had, did they come easy, or quickly mind you? Moreover, if they actually had and your stock was abundant, do they forever remain, 'or does reason require consistent care herself'? My point, is that in leaving your post as to find potential interests, as well as the accommodations required to 'speak to those of suiter's land', you soften your abilities and place as a builder, as well as slowing the progress of your personal display. Better said, will the creation that you leave at home be good enough when you return with others to see it? Or would it have been better to remain at it and profit by another means? I believe this is the proper way. In fact, the principle of monumentality fits perfectly here, in that if you forgo the mission outwards and instead focus on the goods themselves, the grandeur and promise of these efforts will speak for themselves. "Build it and they will come." What this means is that if you focus on the work, and to the ethic throw yourself in, then by virtue of the product you'd expect, those around could not help but see it. This seems more lasting and favorable then actively trying to get others in, as upon arrival you have shortened the very reason that their attention was meant to bring.
            <br>&emsp;This is more or less my second point. The first being that the ideas and care that we have, sees the good in embracing those on either our own or with other people. "It is simply a line that is right and proper, and bettered by others; removed though if it itself is replaced with another direction: even if that new route is done well itself." In other words, the right thing to do will readily support and smoothen the goodness required to reach it, as well as the goodness that it provides. "For that is what makes it the right route, in that we are most able and rewarded for doing so. To that way we'll say its whole." Then, that second point merely says that the means to that improvement will simply come from being the best version of ourselves. Instead of looking for other routes that we could do well, or trying to show off to others what you have become, simply be the good that you wish to show. For that will be the most evident proposal as to why goodness should be the one. "And in that, are we not still fine on our own."
        </div>
        <div id="living">
            For our course we will die. We are currently living though, so to that end I merely anticipate how our time will be till then. Morseso do I reflect on how things have already occurred, and use those to furnish more accurate estimations along with more reasonable values of what I wish to obtain and avoid. Now, for me the right kind of life is always one in which you are actually living. And seeing as an abundance and regularity of this is important, then brief and occasional highs are unideal. Instead, for example, we can indulge in writing, study, reflection and or other creative means; be it in war movies or great dramas, immersive sims or skill based shooters, there is a piece for us all. More than that, can we see others treat these things in their own way: these are the creatives. In this day and age they are everywhere, from pithy little comments regarding philosophy on Twitter, to more interesting and rich discussions on Youtube. "And all other kinds for all other pieces spread abundantly between." Furthermore, it would seem that our interest here, in activities let's say, is such that the amount we care and our ability to be thrown in, determinans the resulting satisfaction. On the former, if we think about particular things then we can find more worth in them, or, more likely, can we share interests with such things with comrades and friends, 'wherein the value of a group is formed'. Here, the height of the appeal rises significantly for each one involved. Moreover, does it encourage self attention as well as communal support regarding our capacity to be generous through these things. "In that sense, if we care for a film, then on our own we may simply recognize its good and(more or less) silently respect it. If this thing is cared for by a group though, then not only do the basics of your attention feel more substantial, but further investments and care are placed by virtue of you being drawn; as well then, would the way in which you contributed towards this, be it in analysis, criticism or pure reverence, be brought and cultivated by the helping hands of those others around you. Together, all of these eyes on some thing makes it more appealing and accessible to abundantly treat: which is where we live the most."
            <br>&emsp;It must not be forgotten though that our selection of interests ought to adhere to a measure of 'regularity and ease'. That is, we ought to be able to do the things we like often and simply. "For our lives are not meant to have momentarily reached the highest point, or within a given duration do so for an instant, then come back down to a point best characterized as 'nonliving'." By virtue of our engagement and care of things, will we be wholesomely satisfied and fulfilled through the various actions that we do. We'll read many books, write many things and discuss much; moreover, will we train and refrain so we can be more well founded and wise in both our desires and fortitude. Occasional and brief vacations, the glory from impressing others, seeming clever, rushing to be seen, these things and their vain consequences are no lasting measure for what is truly good. "For the end which they offer is eventually minor, and irregular at that." In this case, ought the interests of ourselves and our friends be onto those genuine things. Moreover, would our relations with the former reflect our own stake in the latter -as to come together on something good and worthwhile. Seeing as we are looking to spend our time well, makes us in a way restricted from doing poor things with other people. "For even though we may be supported and drawn, still will these activities wain."
            <br>&emsp;Conclusively then will we say that something is good based on its nature. what we are right to do then, is line ourselves up with those things whose good is substantial and lasting. Therein, will our amendment to that mark the soundest way, even if some other indulgence or excitement seemed more appealing: for what it offers is a mere moment. "And we are looking for lives, whose range themselves accounts from beginning to end." What we must understand then is that it is to things which we apply ourselves and thus our measure of lasting goodness. In that, will we be wrong to choose things that fit otherwise, even if it means we are left doing the right thing by ourselves. Again, even if an action is one that draws you, and moreso are you able to have the company of friends, that this end or activity is not sound simply from being so -and such friendship is otherwise a fortune, for how many truly ordain themselves to something well? Within reason, what's offered must be lasting and accessible, as well as cooperative to other interests, rather than draining the rest of the whole. "Ought we choose things which allow us to be drawn and productive within other things as well. Foolish ambitions or exciting events, however harmless or acceptable, may in fact work out of line with a host of other things. Seeing as our life is meant to be full of goodness rather than briefly experiencing it, then the whole of our time that need be filled must be done so with things that fit and nourish eachother. However pleasing and or sound a particular thing is, we ought to see it as it is with respect to our lives. For it may not seem conducive across the board of other things. And we are best when that range is full."
            <br>&emsp;These are our values. Not only do we hold them, but we practice them too. And in seeing so and feeling the strength by its effect, can we say that no other choice or obstacle is worth detouring from this. The road is open in front of us, and this is our reason for movement. "Not only does it take us down this path, but it also determines the smoothness of the ride." For as we get more comfortable in the seat and acquainted with the wheel, so does the terrain feel more even and leveled out; moreso, can we see more as we travel along. This in total feels like a worthwhile fair. "Take me," as Socrates says, "oh destiny and fortune, for in these tracks will I have lived knowing that your end would be reached: and all that lay beside in its wholesome grace and glory, will be my just and gracious claim." Conjuring this sort of attitude within ourselves will see that its principal nourishment and rewards become ingrained and easily faceted into the seams and or proclivities of our minds. With these then affirmed and producing, will the steps we take be suitably great.
            <br>&emsp;It is worth noting though, that the path will call out to you in ways that it would improve. Concerning what we care about, ought we firmly remember that it is not our time and place on the road that counts, rather our destination. "As we said, initial excitement and content for a current path is not what makes it good, rather if its substance is substantial as you go along, as opposed to the common risk of it whittling away." In that sense, it is our reasoning and philosophy that curates our direction. And to the ends prescribed do we say their good, because the result from adhering to them is continually fruitful. In that, will theology and ethics trump dinner parties and soap operas; dialogue in film will appeal to us more than the drama on t.v; moreso, will nourishment be seen as what provides towards this path, rather than the needs of futility. In that sense, the demands placed on us are the principles and machinery needed to operate the vehicle for this path. "What some other end needs, I bear no response. Like a bears care for calculus, only this path is becoming of me". Serenity and ability will reward you from these times. For the profits of the highest kind benefit those in those most assuming ways. "The good route for a beast is one where it can easily survive; of man though, will the goodness we gain from the land of reason, offer us the means to be the greatest version of ourselves, in that an appreciation and respect for this being our path and resolve will sink pleasingly in, as well as rewarding us with the space to be congenially expressive, through industry, creation, friendship and care." And so, cement this stake in your mind for the pure promise of reason and her treats. Bolden yourself from the back, in that you are happy enough to simply go this way. But also have trust, that the riches that you find will extend themselves beyond the initial borders of your learning mind; for upon realizing themselves in you will the light they bring shine further out and high: wherein the borders of reason, like weeds, grow over the fading greens of ignorance. "The residents of which will suitably follow."
            <br>&emsp;Which is how outstanding communities and friendship are made.
        </div>

        <div id="ameasure">
            The heart of any point or discussion is what's most important. If some technical point is missed, so be it. "Let us measure one's expression by what is meant, rather than how it is fitting a supposed measure." Foremost, is the fact that without an objective measure, then all errors of truth are in themselves unfounded. Fully at least, ought a criticism base itself on an objective measure of the world in order to say that someone's conjecture or view was unsound. And to be clear, that validity is merely of the form, whereas this universal scale reflects a test as to whether the terms in use are properly used. This means for assessment though seems unobtainable for those already outside its place. This is due to the fact that if you had reached it, or supposed you had, then you definitively would have come from a place wherein this absolute had not yet been claimed. "And my sense is that no proposal would truly be sound, if in coming from a place of ultimate imperfection that it thought that its reward would be perfection." Perhaps this is best described as the inability for fullness to be reached by those things somewhat hollow. "For in that, the end is already there."
            <br>&emsp;Anyways, what we are trying to do otherwise, or at least what we are trying to contend with is an objective measure. As stated, proficiency marks itself as a sort of machinery, wherein upon its ways a suitable amendment is stained. In other words, within these operations there is a proper use: but without the objective measure, we cannot say which operations to do. We could refine this however by saying that what is better are those things which upon proper use, give us the highest good. That is, if we more or less killed someone, but upon determination did it well, then the good in that would still be lower than the good from being generous and kind. That is why I say, in this case at least, that we ought to tend to the heart of the matter. For in this current state I am unable to say whether being honest and frugal are truly the best, but we can at least say these are more favorable and well elicited than thievery and licentiousness. Additionally, we might say that there is an important point of distinguishing between the propriety of man. That is, we surely must be more productive, consistent, cooperative and sensible, as opposed to impatient, compulsive, irrational and irate. "Again, for the good within the heart of our conduct."
            <br>&emsp;The discussion can be furthered when we think of what holds this medium by which these obvious things act. As we said, these more acceptable traits and or actions seem fitting for us; however, their place is suspended from a ceiling in which we cannot quite express. Moreover, do more refined questions such as mortality, deliverance, freedom etc. case themselves in those rafters -as opposed to comparing the value and use of dishonesty and sportsmanship. Second to those finer concerns, are the natural workings in which even the everyday things of our life spurrs into our minds. Since we are in fact creatures of the sort who are both subject to those higher concerns, as well as able to wonder, it is not surprising that an equal kind of thought is triggered onto the simplest of things. "Whether we should buy this house or that, or choose this amendment or another, does not fair in terms of significance of whether there is an afterlife, yet to each we address them the same." This is unclear of me, but I only mean to suggest that even the normal things within our lives are in need of some scale in order for their respective choices to be deemed in accordance with truth. "For how do you know which one of your tastes for either ketchup or mustard is better than the other? Better yet, as they are separate objects, could you place one in front of the other with respect to the truth?" To that would I say, that neither red or yella is clearly superior. That is because I don't have measure.
            <br>&emsp;One of the reasons this question is so difficult to conclude is that we assume too much in terms of what the answer would be. As we are asking what will guide us objectively, what does the delivery, or rather expression of those suggestions mean? In other words, where is the message by which this truth is known? "Could it be that as it happened this reference of authority was in brail? Moreover, what should we assume the messaging means; ought we translate it interpretively, as if it were a mere bearing against our own inclinations? or maybe we'll adhere to it word for word." Whichever end we take in this regard, it is simply hard to entertain. Foremost, is that we are in most ways ascribing a result that is in fact absent. That is, we have an idea of what truth would be and what it would contain, but we expect too much of the kind of answer given. "It's as if we were foolishly afraid, yet smart enough to ask for wisdom; what should our profit be in regards to this foolish end: is there truth for that, or genuine guidance rather?"
            <br>&emsp;For me personally, I see very little in the way of a truth that we would anticipate finding.
            <br>&emsp;As it is, we deem the reference of authority to be the element or thing which can answer our questions. "The absolute is that which explains all that I wish to know." In my case, I am simply buckled at the thought of derailing this opposition. The heart though, in the matter of me, says very clearly and richly too, that our thinking of both the issues and their end, will clarify what it is in the truth that we seek. In other words, if we put more effort in, then we will not fall prey to that all too common misappropriation of what tool is necessary. In fact that best explains it. An ultimate tool will produce the ends of any prompt, or rather by it all results are given. This we will call an operation. "That to my prayer this mechanism produced. And whereby to the end in which all regularly and fully do so, did it earn the spot of our highest stake. 'For our faith is placed onto that which most giveth'."
            <br>&emsp;Anyways, we have said that right action is that which corresponds to the machine. In that, we are well to take good advice. Here, we have a problem though. What advice is good? For goodness, or right action, is that which complies within the commands of a certain operation. "So if you wanted cheese, then onto the rules of doing so you would so well; and having done so, then to the end of cheese will we say that you were good of it: for you arranged yourself appropriately to what it required." The good then is in how you meet things. The most divisive question then, is whether we are better to personally address the worries and interests as we deem fit, and simply ordain ourselves to do these well, or do the actions we take become choice when they are given as directions themselves. In other words, does the objective authority tell us what things to do, and equally in turn declare that we do them well, or do we determine what things to do, but treat them in a similarly appropriate way?
            <br>&emsp;Discerning so is troublesome. My view, is that the path forward in these respects is one that we are continually out of shape for. That is because a great deal of our best effort here comes in the form of negation, whereby we explain why determinism and preceding genera are weak in their claim for truth. To suggest what is otherwise strong and likely, demands that we employ our greatest means for questioning: the toil of which is the hardest for us to do. For we are in some ways asking questions by highlighting what we don't know; and the struggle is in being articulate and sensible enough to see what aspects of your considerations that you have excluded. By my estimate, and at the very least where I judge myself in coming short in any given experience, is when our intellectual rigor loses the steam and clarity in order to do that. I must say though, that in these foremost states, despite when I run out of steam or when the finishings seem incomplete in retrospect, that more of the world I've claimed. And relatives aside, can I say objectively that our current approach is one that reflects a great deal of soundness and civility, in both the encompassing nature by which these inquiries are produced, along with the genuine candor and process in which these incomplete steps move a little bit ahead further each time. From that I am proud. And admittedly, I cannot say what is true and what is not. I can see it though, 'like a stranger staring at you in the crowd but is hard to recognize'. Perhaps in a few months time we will be better prepped to make more common attempts within this rounded framework. Still, I am in many ways skirting around this integral flame. "As I see it though, our own moisture and ignorant wetness, dampens any embers that, if I were otherwise pure and beholden, might ignite and grow." I must say though that this is why I wish to participate in this quest, for in the reasoning and all its adventure, I learn more and become more ingrained towards the path of being a better man.
            <br>&emsp;Maybe this explains it all: that without that objective measure, I am unsure what that end means. "For how else would I know."
        </div>
        <div id="target">
            If one were hunting, they would prepare and ready themselves 'for the fight' so to speak. Then, when they were aiming at their target, a good shot would be taken. Note though, that this shot was not good because they 'would' make it, rather that it seemed best. However, if they hit their mark then this is success and the hunt seems complete. "We might say then that however unlikely something is definitively, that the end is itself objective, or strictly the case no matter the outcome." The point being, that despite our attempt being rooted in weakness and strength, the result is explicit. Ought we conduct the whole of our lives under this model? I would say no. That is because in that case, for living, the model which we would base our actions towards has no explicit end. Another way of looking at it is by seeing how the hunter, having won his prey, still has to continue to other actions or things. In that, this activity is merely part of living; and so the ends of this species(so to speak), achieves its end differently than that of the base genera.
            <br>&emsp;The reason I bring this up, with that core question in mind, is that at regular intervals I feel as though(in explaining it) that I can take my shot. And that's not to say that our ability to do so doesn't increase or that our soundness in the description fails to improve; there seems to be no end is what I am saying. This is best put in a similar light to that hunt, wherein we see a good chance to make our target, then complete the step to some explicit end. The concern here is that our explanation of life and the model which we base it on, never seems to finish. There is always more evidently. And akin to our limit, I can say that our attempt to bring our understanding closer to completion is an eventual point we will not reach.
            <br>&emsp;Saying why is difficult, for as they say, 'how can you say what you cannot know if you don't already know this'. This is a legitimate argument in most ways. And I don't claim to have an answer otherwise, despite having limiting principles that effectively describe it(our limit that is). To me, our place as thinkers bar us from anything more than measurement. For one, we are not the things that we are measuring, and in that sense lack the constitution of the objects and forms that we mean to explain. Secondly, it would seem that our place as inquirers continually builds itself as we learn more, in that if there was an end that we reached, so would our existence continue; and consequent to this, is more impressions that either A) affirm or weaken the views that we have, or B) introduce new additions or possible negations to our conclusions. "A nice way of looking at it is in wondering where the ocean ends and the air begins, for the waves or momentary splashes intrude upon the space of the latter; in effect, the limits of the prior's body is difficult as the irregularity of its shape makes it challenging to contrast with an adjacent object."
            <br>&emsp;The hardest thing though is to say why it is that we don't know, or will not for that matter. I suspect that there is an epistemological root to this, in that if one were ignorant of what they didn't know or understand, then those inclusions would not be considered in terms of what they felt was complete(regarding the knowledge of something). This seems quite characteristic of ourselves, and well founded in our quest for further understanding. However, I feel as though this outlook bars me from friends, as having little to say yet being aware of all, sees me as both contradictory, out of place, uneducated, unnecessary and, foremost, unwanted because my highest proposal(as reflects my own aim) is one of indeterminacy.
            <br>&emsp;Let me illustrate what I have to say though. For one reason or the other, there will not be a point where all is known, or better yet will there be no point where we'll not have to act -if even all the knowledge were gained. "Truth must be acted on, and is useless otherwise; like a tip that is made to no one's advantage or benefit." We are aware though and with some grasp on the world, especially the very elements and their origin. In doing so, within meta considerations that is, ought we respect that limit of ours and simply build another model. For how is our understanding meant to produce or profit otherwise, less it expands from the heart of its actual being. "That is the issue in looking for these ultimate truths; they forgo the anticipation of one who can see it with the proper action congenial to their nature." It seems that the only one who would enact those highest principles is the maker himself. To be clear then, we are best in being ontological, rather than knowing ontology. For we are either wrong, assuming, animalistic, or thoughtful. And to me the latter is the most true of our nature.
            <br>&emsp;This can better explain hopefully. The good is in proper action; that is, within an operation there is appropriate conduct within the matter. So, in a scenario of piety, prudence and grace are good in that they are in line with what piety requires. A better example is in skilled labor, in that a machine or device has a proper way of using it; whereupon doing so, or failing to and stumbling, would the former be commentated on as 'Good', whilst the latter would confer 'try again' -as to avoid saying that was bad. Secondly, in summary, are the investigations of the machines themselves. Note, that our preferred outcome is one thing with respect to the total of all things, but we can say that an oven, for example, has the aim of baking, of which the act of doing so well will be good for this. The point then, is how do we know what baking needs, or is in the first place. This, as I would generally suppose, calls on the means of science, wherein an object's identity and possible purpose is brought into question. So if we had a large iron blade, a sharp piece of metal that is, then its use could be of military or decorative kinds. Now, to reiterate, whether one should be done over the other requires a higher understanding of what things one ought to generally do; in this case, we are merely explaining that in either use case, this is how the object could be appropriately used. And I would say that we can base these illustrations on the fact that we are creatures of utility. "We are not making the mold for reality as to make the forms act and arrange, rather we are trying to see how things are in themselves, by virtue of our opportunistic curiosity."
            <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, through analysis we can see the use of the blade. At the very least we can say its operations are derived as such as they appear with relevance to us. "For a pile of gold might otherwise be viable as a paperweight. 'Though King Midas may himself seek an opportunity with that." In this scenario, we could describe how our tools of analysis were merely such, in terms of what's useful, by further understanding what a thing was in order to see what it did. Two thoughts come to mind. One, is that by being more detailed and focused, on the sword let's say, then we may become more capable in wielding the sword(by the use case) as well as employing our construct capacities to a greater effect(by our resourceful mean). Secondly though, we may discover that its main component was iron, and that it itself can be smelted into other use cases. In that sense, by virtue of our curious nature, an analysis aimed at bettering our use of an object, may in fact allow us to perform and or manufacture other objects. A good example is the lightbulb, whereby its benefit from lighting our nights, also saw further understandings of how light worked itself. Consequently, direct advances in electronics were derived, as were accompanying advancements in engineering and physics.
            <br>&emsp;To bring this to an end, we can say that beneath the proper use of an item, or the proper display within an operation, is the understanding of what the conduct is, what would be useful to us when we operate, as well as alternative devices and or routes that become beneficial themselves. Herein though have we reached our limit. Or mine at least as we'll say. For at this point can I only decipher and explain the metrics of desire and avoidance seemingly conducive to us as people, but an objective measure seems otherwise a challenge to claim. I wonder though if there either is one, or one that we would find useful or consequential, compared to that earlier sentiment that we could say sufficiently defines what is good for us -as we would commonly expect as people. "Perhaps the lord's aims are other." But if we do not know that truly, then would the reach of our opportune casing not mark the point of sufficient regard. 'Wherein all that sat beneath did so with proper respect for what they are bent towards doing, to which we could then soundly amend?"

        <div id="ofdivision">
            A body of water is a strong analog for how primary substances operate. The word melting comes to mind, in the sense that if a volume of ice cream were melted down then its constituent parts of milk, cream and sugar would become the substances. In water’s case, if you split it, or rather divide it, water remains. That is the idea more or less. To be clear, water, as is the case for any molecule, would either be broken down into its elementary particles(and radiation) and so forth: but we don’t say that water is elementary. Strictly put, a general body will hold itself upon being split, like water, but equally transform its shape and type whilst remaining of the kind. A blanket, or cloth for that matter, illustrates this best. Simply, if the blanket folds, hath the material stayed? Of course it has, and none will disagree.
            <br>&emsp;Here is something to consider then. Guided by the fact that nature appears to be fundamentally vibrations, regarding matter that is, then as a blotch of water here or a fold and wrinkle of the cotton there, is the principal layer by which these vibrations come to be not merely this base foundation knotting around and turning out, but doing so without dividing or loosing its kindred claim? For, just as there is liquid water and nitrogen, so there beith the strings of an olive garden branch, or a linen rope; the point being that by that primary being or substance, that its imaginative engineering, as to whether it moves and curves this or that way, or in this or that fashion, continues and lastingly does retain its act of being genera(or of the same base kind). “And do not all the genus’ by that token, duly exhibit their proportions by virtue of that? I feel as though there is strength in believing so.” To further note then, ought we at least address the necessity of this blanket, or at least its constituent place amongst other potential beings(of contrary nature for example) or even as to how this primary cause remains and heeds itself as so. Perhaps it may be divisible, or, in other words, that there is more than one principal material. It is fairly possible. Note though, for the sake of forwardness, that being singular and specific in how a mere body of individuals can be woven and stitched, sufficiently explains the ostensibly whole matter that we see, wherein we can likely explain wherefrom it followed. The idea at least of indivisibly and genera seems to offer a more or less prudent beginning.
            <br>&emsp;Let us summize our proposal then, that the folds of reality make what seem to be true, what they ostensibly are. In that case, the base element is one, however unfolding. Principally, this is true because it does not divide. And moreover, as our heart in this suggests, that all the peculiar things that we see are in fact one, and merely the ends of that ever making mold. To that, would the genera that holds all our kinds, be in fact not so, for it was no holder to anything other than itself. “What makes this true is the division of water, whereby the separation of it does not change its form. And by that, we can reasonably suggest that the unchanging arrangements reach their particular end, whilst being constitutionally the same. And is there room for God in that. I simply wonder.”
            <div class="qu">Considering what this is about, that is the heart from me</div>
        </div>
        <div id="divisibility">
            Let me delve into a topic -as opposed to fretting over the meaning of things. To preface, if one separates an element and finds that there are only adjoining elements of the same kind, then we can say that this is of genera, rather than separate species. The common example used is of water, wherein a dividing of it maintains its place as water. In a similar way, would swirl ice cream be broken into two separate kinds of vanilla and chocolate; flavor wise though, would each of those be their own kind. Now, just as two bodies of water are the same kind, so can they rearrange themselves and or configure their shape in differing ways, yet remain as water. One way of looking at this is if we shape a dough in a circle or star, the kind remains. Only if we add another aspect of 'kind of dough with respect to shape, flavor etc.' does a division take, otherwise they are merely arrangments of the same thing.
            <br>&emsp;Now, what I suppose is that the primary element of entirety has merely configured itself in the ways that appear to us now. The key point then, is if the constitution of all things are the same, differing only in arrangement rather than kind, then each object is only ostensibly different; this is by virtue of it being rearranged rather than its own unique kind. In that sense, an apple and banana are the same thing fundamentally, separate though in the arrangement. "Again, two bodies of water are the same kind, but may splash this way or drip down that side, of which there is a difference in the figure, but not the form."
            <br>&emsp;Now, there are many suppositions to this. One, is whether this principal element accounts for all that could be, or if there is negation of it. Technically this refers to its contraries, but more interestingly is the assumption of nothing. Imagine if you were in the ocean, looking for fish or sharks perhaps. If you looked around and saw none, you may say there is nothing there. What about the water though? This is a clever issue in that we are merely prodding at the idea of some aspect which lies outside our principal grasp. However, the question bears the only merit here, as we are not so clear on what 'something' actually is. Nevertheless, it pays to address whether there is such thing as 'no thing' at all, or if that principal element in fact protrudes to all. "We ask though, for where is that bound? Less it is infinitely everywhere, then are the points where it's not merely so for it lacks what is principally so: for that though I do not know, and lean towards the fact that I cant. But I can suppose and or ask -hence my limited intelligence." We could follow this with many inquiries as to the nature of reality, in its compactedness namely. But a more pressing issue is at hand. We have said that we know for the most part what things are, how they can be used and that doing so well(with respect to the operation at hand), marks the point of goodness. We have also noted that understanding which operations are best to choose is a challenge. Worth noting though, is that our quest to define such measures and their corresponding end is effectively a means of reassurance. This is because we can already say that idleness is poorer than engagement, as is honesty superior to deceit. The problem though is that we cannot know completely: and people make little effort without clear guidance.
            <br>&emsp;The main problem as I see it then, is that where we presume to hold the answer feels irreconcilable; that being our description of God. This is only the crossroads though. Because I, being sound and wise, can truly see in a wholesome way, that peace, tranquility, natural amendment and commendable success are worthwhile and sufficient to achieve; just as I can say that gluttony and larceny are irrefutably bad. "My discretion at least says these are appropriate values, as my palette rightfully hungers for nutrition." I make no claim that these are true because it is what the world demands, or what God would command; rather these are the insights and discoveries of one in touch with reason and themselves. Better said, in regards to the things relevant to us, we have noticed and tended to those which our natural faculties and gifted strength prefer and wish to avoid. "I need not God's understanding or approval to take my hands off the fire." Bringing things back to that point of ignorance, we can offer a useful alternative. For what it's worth, I think those values of content and satisfaction, as well as those vices of frailty and sloth, are worth amending to and or resolving to avoid. However, I do believe that doing so from pure sensibility is below our threshold of capacity; that is, if the primary being ought to be known for a general principle to be instated, then I feel as though this measure can be effectively defined. I do hesitate at the thought that our attempt will be incomplete, but I think it bears strength and thus I'll proceed.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, it is that idea I've stated. There is no God, prior reason, true absence or ability for intervention. The world as we see it, and in turn who we are and what we interact with, is merely the root layer of being arranging itself in different ways. Why it does so is beyond my vocabulary; still, it is not the interesting question. What is paramount is in regards to this view of divisibility, whether or not the need for prior reason is necessary, as well as the present ability for intervention to occur. Put another way, in terms of siding with one view over the other, does the merit and or strength within their ostensibly being the same things lessen the strength of reason preceding matter(and its consequences), or is there still an effective requirement that this uniformly generic being had a precedent as well. I am not entirely sure. What I can say though, however sound my premise is, is that the matter that would come from this reason is fairly explained by this view of divisibility. And all I would say then, is that whether it was brought into being itself, or if there are commanding and intruding rules of what proper conduct is, I would still take the Protestant way and its subjective determinations. That is, if there is God, that his place within us is a constant benefit regardless of our actions. "More or less, that whether we believe or not, or otherwise steal and rape, heaven still waits. For God intends it for us no matter the case." This at least can be comforting, if not a removal of avoiding one's sensible claim of real human flourishing. And again, I cannot say strictly whether those claims are true, nor can I really say what God intends or demands that we do, but I still have a place as evident of the times before.
            <br>&emsp;Personally, I see no problem or glaring weakness in defining my view of the world otherwise under the guise of attentiveness, reason and the resolutions that follow. In fact, the only element that has me concerned, is whether or not my end will treat me to the blissful nothingness and rest that I look forward to and expect. Perhaps it is that latter part that renders me wrong. As I do not know. Which in effect conveys my concerns; for how could anything but overwhelming strength or brazen certainty protect me from doubts regarding my foremost desire? "I suspect that it is assuming that the opposite of this would otherwise happen." Frankly though, I couldn't believe that some favorable end wasn't guaranteed. For what sort of God would penalize one who merely sought to be the greatest version of themselves, regardless of whether they were ignorant or bound to the measure? As we have said, goodness is in how you do things, no matter the task. And personally, I have grave doubts that God so strongly cares about being orthodox; or at least I greatly expect that goodness at heart will earn his approval.
            <br>&emsp;In summary, I think that end of congruence and praise is how the ultimate measure is well explained. "Which items fit the scale though I do not though, for I still can't proclaim who holds the lever
        </div>
        <div id="ostentation">
            Here is a theory of everything. A rock exhibits its purpose by the actions of its characteristics. "Wherein its nature is in motion, and thus to a targeted end." As people, our chief trait is intelligence, that is we can think and inquire. In this way, our purpose will be brought out when we have understood the world. In the same way as a runner has much to go if they are merely average at it, so will we assume we are incomplete if there is knowledge left to acquire. An interesting point however is that the means by which we partake in this action is one of discourse. In this way, we are merely discussing things, as if they were subjects of our investigation. Another point, is whether or not a completion of our discussions, in that all things were known, marks the place in which we were done; or if we ought to use the material that we've acquired for some other end. Or maybe, be it from a limit of learning or the unnecessary fact that we would even completely know, that further action would be worthwhile at all. Moreover could we say that seeing as our rooted kind is through inquiry, that if that bowl was full(so to speak), that further action could not be done at all. "For, definitively, the mark of us being complete, corresponds with there being nothing else to do. More or less."
            <br>&emsp;A not unimportant as I see it, is how these discussions are made, for we do not know everything already -hence our purpose in doing so. However, in a practical sense as well as what we would think sound and just, is how we are meant to progress from incompletion to so. This to me is the hardest thing to explain. I think despite this that an illustration can level the ground. As we have said, all things are ostensibly the same. That isn't to say that there is only one element, rather that all things which are not of that primary status, are necessarily derivative. "For if they existed otherwise, then they would clearly be primary, as you are or you aint." Now, in our discourse we may ask questions about this principal component as to whether it is material itself, has dimensions, a body, or if it's a unity or plurality, has contraries and or accidents etc. I must divulge the issue though. Take a sphere and consider its volume. The basis for it in terms of the length and width, portions inside as well as what the object could not otherwise be -as to lose its uniformity would make it oblique, who would become more sphere like if its own ovalness became more uniform. Now, take a bunch of spheres and put them together; now you have a body of spheres, an ocean if you will. Imagine then that these units arrange themselves into peculiar ways, so much so that a complexity emerges so far that vision of these complexes are seen. Can you see how both the viewer and the products seen are merely those baser units rearranged? In that we say that these higher objects are only ostensibly so, as who they are housed from is ubiquitously fundamental.
            <br>&emsp;What is most important is in how our discourse can address the 'nature' of this primary being, while also considering how whole elements lack any of those aspects. What I mean is that a derived body has no genuine measure, in either its material or form. "It is merely a product of those core elements". Additionally, could we clarify by saying that arrangement means nothing more than bodies of the same kind. "As water is the same whenever it is split." The point though, is that beyond our theoretical position of what this primary component is, do we forgo a great deal of eligible consideration if the subject in question(more or less) rests above the level of genera. That is, how there could be a form of the principal, or variety in itself, or quantiy of sorts. This is so in reference to our spherical model, that just as the bodies in which these units are arranged, so do the containing aspects of the sphere itself similarly break down. "As if there were a statue of bread, that upon splitting apart revealed itself to still be bread, yet those same portions were equally derived from water and yeast."
            <div class="qu">The foremost question then is where does our refining end, and where does a proper address of the primary being begin?</div>
            Where discourse comes in, is that it means only to better explain, rather than purportedly know. In other words, we allow ourselves to have proportions, quantity, necessity and contraries of the primary being for the sake of consideration. True wisdom and articulate strength would then seem to be when one can decipher which aspects of these are true, a simple example being the unrequired factor of accidents. And truly we may not be able to fully say, but at least within our descriptions and address, can we speak more firmly and sound about which elements and or aspects are fairest and ripe when it comes to those principals which are otherwise unknown. In doing so, will our illustration of the world from our point of view, reflect it appropriately in as much as we can see what it seems to be. "For we may not know God or what he is fundamentally, but we at least know that he(or one of the kind) would not(or in any case could) be contrary. And that just seems reasonable to suppose."
            <br>&emsp;With all that being said, if we assess that our end is one where all is known, then the form in which that would take would necessarily suffice for completion to be reached. And in that sense, would an explanation seem fair as the mark in which we were credited. To finish so however, does seem to require that the basis for the operation in which the end is reached, is itself adhered to. This is why with discourse being that action, that a removal of all factors as to remove ostentation, feels inappropriate, while wisdom of there being ostensibility feels sufficient as we otherwise address the primary elements as if they were whole -as opposed to singular in aspect, which is most difficult to know.
        </div>

        <div id="propiety">
            This may illustrate the whole of it. Too much do we pull away in both the front and the back. In the latter, we try and find the specific workings of all things, whereas our best effort would be to simply address how you feel and what in that regard is favorable. On the front, we forgo assessing things from the stance of their place amongst those values, and instead we look ahead to find an answer that will declare which things to do. This seems foolish, as we eventually will miss the mark of the congenial goods that we seek. Otherwise, we end up making a portrait of someone whose merit lies in that they could tell us what to do, rather than actually being insightful. Or, we look too much inwards, and fail to see the simple nature in which we are trying to address.
            <br>&emsp;As Buddha had truths that pertained to living, so will we consider our truths as those values at the back; their essence is to the subject though, as what will amount to goodness varies. "If pleasure was preferable, then some might like sweet and others spicy. To each and their own then, will objects be judged as good so much as they fall in line with that." In this sense, we are arranged a certain way; the truth though is that the world in which we live and the context in which our assessments address, is of humanity and its offerings. In this case, we can assume our standards as general so that we can more simply reflect on the medium by which our nature participates in.
            <br>&emsp;All I mean is that our regard for what goodness is lies simply in the common areas of food, training, careers, family, leisure and death. We need not understand the roots of this congeniality, or rather why these things are so relevant to us and attuned to attract in a certain way. In that sense our only place is one where we are reasonable. In this case, we are merely applying our time to find things which fit us the best, and the scale by which we use is merely sufficient if it is the best one in place.
            <br>&emsp;The highest ethic then reflects that highest principle of seeking goodness, with the soundest resolve then being a true assessment of both the subjects that we attract as well as the truth in the mold. This method bases itself on the nature which we have. If we were more primitive and innate, then our response to the world would be of instinct and compulsion. Our discerning efforts onto what would be better to receive goes then in harmony with the consent of things which we have similarly assessed. This removes the foolish mistake of using one's reason to achieve lower aims. Instead, ought the things that we do reflect the rational nature by which we apply ourselves.

        <div id="forensics">
            Discourse, whether private or personal, effectively describes itself as the means of explanation. When we assess what things are in themselves or regard how things can be or came to be inherently, we are explaining. The reason that it is called discourse is that we have to address the point we are at as one who lacks the answer; consequently, we must disregard certain things and give more credit to others so that we can progress. “Looking at things requires that we speculate and define, so that our estimates and qualifications for truth are employed towards a proper conclusion.” Discourse then simply demonstrates how we use terms and subjects in a way that satisfies the heart of an explanation. This is not to say that it is true, only that we are using the tools we have to paint a better picture. “And it may prove more favorable to merely splotch the brush and give it some highlights, then detail every leaf on the tree and bush.”
            <br>&emsp;Opposite to this is deliberation. In this case we are strictly focused on what we are going to do; and things will be assessed, only as they are with respect to us. So we may analyze the elements of an apple, and address how it as an object is meant to be, but to us it is a flavourful fruit and treat; moreso would we judge it as a kind of nourishment, to which we resolve ourselves towards. Discourse would better explain how we are as things in general, and that since we are natured how a nature’d thing should be; that we seek rest and are averse to aimlessness is determined by us though. Thats not to say that our roots of desire and distaste aren’t rooted in something fundamental or that they could not be explained, but we are not trying to learn so for the sake of discussion; rather, we are looking at the apple as nutritious because we experience it as so, and are thus deliberate on where and how we’ll use it.
            <br>&emsp;Another way of looking at this is that discourse merely helps us to understand things, both in a particular sense and one overall(in which those particulars fit). The problem though is that our wish to learn more and find higher principles can prevent us from directing ourselves in a proper way. The idea is not complex, but if our heads are turned so we can see the truth behind us, we may fixate on it too much and forget to bring it infront for actual use. To me, the important note is that knowledge and its means through discourse is effectively aimed at truth: this amounts to what is objectively right and wrong. However, what is good or bad is quite easy to determine. “By our inclinations though in experiencing rest and joy -as found in things, of which we oblige- despite us being ignorant of what is actually correct.” Moreso, as our thoughts turn inwards rather than outwards, will we see a great deal of conflict in acting outside any objective measure. The point though, is that the ease of our breath and lightness of mind, is a mark of something favorable and good, of which we can amend to no differently than our ignorance elsewhere would promote us to steal and lie. The absolute scale does say what is right and wrong, but only that we know our resolve to live well and die easily is true. “Even though by this token, for our lack could crime and lechery also be suitable.”
            <br>&emsp;What I have found though is that the deliberations I have upon myself reveal that our own needs are not placed in that ultimate demand, nor is it one that my reflections suggest we are capable of achieving. As an admission to all the logicians and philistines(who I don’t equate), I will say that my resolve here is not one that is banked on truth, only reason. That is, we have come to terms with ourselves, and as those insights regard matters such as ontology, death, liberty and pain, do I merely craft pillars and frameworks around those central matters: the heart of which centers on me. I don’t see them as true though, rather as rafters that allow for our senses to determine which is appropriately good or bad, only on a local scale. That is, satiation, and of a fresh kind, is of my favor whether I know it is true, or how. “It’s my philosophical attempt ot exist profoundly, in this lil world of me.”
            <br>&emsp;Put another way, my personal inquiries have revealed to me that a natural death is promising and acceptable; on top of that though, have I flattened out any bias or ill foundedness that may otherwise be had in the quest to know the actual truth of it. And again, I will not say that it is ultimately true, nor will I correspondingly rest with the utmost certainty that it will be the case. However, my senses tell me that the trouble is for those who wish to prove otherwise, and that my common place is one that more ordinarily rests in that natural position. I may be wrong, but those actions within my own affairs are where my actions go, with confidence and strength mind you, no matter if I know.
        </div>
        <div id="completion">
            An important feature of any thing is that it has a right way to be. This is because, depending on the characteristics that form its nature, will it have some end or being that is congenial to it. In that sense, the inanimate life of a rock gives its being an impermanent state. Whereas an animal is almost definitively more actionable. What is important then is detailing the scale by which objects are suitable for an entity. How it works, is that externals sit outside a subject, waiting to act upon it as a response to its attraction; that is, if the subject wields it, then the attraction will be one of craftsmanship and skill -as if wielding the handle brought the blade into submission. In other words, the man, or subject, attracts an object into its practical use.
            <br>&emsp;Another attraction is one of compulsion or rather innate response. This amounts to the objects around impressing themselves onto the subject, who then replies with a response that reflects their nature. A clear example is that if you put a monkey in the cold, it would shiver, while a penguin would appear content; obviously, a naked man would be colder than the former, but the bodies of each are arranged differently none the less and thus respond differently to what is impressed upon them. I use the word attraction then in the sense of a mold, or vessel. The world imparts itself onto some entity who takes in the expression and materializes it into an intrinsic response. "The heat comes in and I am affected, wherein I feel hot, can address so and speak, as well as discern between the slices of this experience; relatively speaking, any point could be considered whether it was more or less of something, or rather one's attention or potential experience no less, could align itself by virtue of possibility into a state which reflects the current arrangement and those that are equally plausible."
            <br>&emsp;The basics of this are extremely complex, in the sense that temperature is nothing more than matter vibrating. And so when we say that a man is startled by some noise behind him, we ostensibly say that his senses were alerted and his body sprung him to action, but molecules and hormones specifically are at the heart of this play. Moreover, are the constituents of reality and their fundamental reasons for acting even more basic than that. If you look at a plant though, you can see how its components functionally convert sunlight and CO2 into sugars and necessary products. Now, the nature that caused this is one that similarly results in other entities acting in their own sort of ways. There are many kinds of plants, cells even, and so are there further arrangements of those. Imagine then if a path of arrangement led to a point where there was innate sense. That is, if a rock hit the ground and made a sound, or was melted by molten lava, that the reaction would not simply be broken sediments and the physics of sound and heat, rather the rock was aware that it was happening. What if it could see it, or hear it, speak about it too?
            <div class="qu">In that way has man come to be</div>
            Unfortunately, the products of those senses is a wholehearted mess. For even if we can agree that we are seeing, and that we are speaking too, it is not so clear on what we have to say. On one hand, we have made great strides in reducing the need to act at all; that is, we have flattened the curve for our need to address the world in necessary ways. Living though has been removed. On the other side sits those who try and assert a guiding principle, as if that presence of living is valued in itself. Yet they only reach for the answer higher, and falter in the fruits they seek. However, there is a worthwhile remark. Just as heat is really vibrations, so is that living which we truly seek one that more simply reflects a lack of idleness and frivolity, and is full of joy and rest instead. Moreso, could we describe the needs that those wishing to beat survival seek, as an avoidance of stress, injury, insecurity and discomfort; while those within the higher principles are trying to be more collected and arranged around a path and its end, as to bring out the goods they seek in a more assuring and respectful way. The only difficulty is in knowing whether we should act with this model in mind, or if we should display ourselves in some other way. Ought a reasoning man reflect on whether breakfast is good with food or freshness, or is he better to concern himself with how all things generally are. "Is an absolute scale required to determine how right our intent is to eat eggs, or not?" That is the troublesome approach here. That if we don't know how things act principally, then it is hard to be specific about ourselves and the objects we treat.
            <br>&emsp;However, it seems nearly impossible, or at the very least impractical, to describe ourselves and the suitable actions by their constituents. "What should this bag of carbon and bone do on this earthwarren ultraviolet lit day? Maybe I'll use my stomach acid and saliva to break down and digest a mixture of fructose and polymer, or maybe I'll be egregious and use my skills of respiration to intake nicotine: oh how would I enjoy the stimulation of those neurotransmitters!" A more simple example might be that a service would offer(and in effect equate) their products in terms of the dopamine received upon satisfaction. Or, assuming it would taste better, that a waitress would ask if you wanted more pleasure with your coffee. Commonly, it seems we address things, as opposed to their constituents. And this seems for the most part sensible. What happens though when our choices come short, or we are selling ourselves below our potential? How do we improve our benefits and remove any errors? Moreso, if we are thoughtful, how do we merely foray into the lands of reason and take her fruits for the benefit of our experience, "rather than worrying excessively about the analysis of principals and objects themselves?" Even more than that, how do we arrange ourselves so that our inquisitive means are towards things which are truly good in innately? "Less bureaucracy and innovation be spent towards cigarettes and fast food satisfaction."
            <div class="qu">A general qualification is that the good and the bad in our lives equal up; that is, experiences amount to moments, however long, and they are either of some severity of favor or not, along with adjacent qualities such as eventual outcomes later on -while our present anticipation is of the moment itself, whereas the truth in that event is more primary</div>
            Returning to the starting point, that things will affect something naturally. "As oil and water don't mix by their natures, so will too little oxygen impact ours." The ground floor is worth addressing, only generally though. We don't need to consider that we breathe oxygen, or what sugar even is; these are arduous tasks and difficult pieces of knowledge to apply. What we must be concerned with is that all things will act as they are made to do; and we are an arrangement of those things, with various functioning organs for example. And in that sense, we must assume that there is little which is forgoing us, as the fact that we have a nature suggests that other things are filling themselves into the mold which the arrangement of our nature makes. Inquiring then into the ways of that nature, can ready us to proceed in ways which give us more personally, as we can see what things are good for our kind, and thus advance in a way which is congenial to their arrival. That last point is key. Why we should not ultimately address how we acquire food, get sleep, stay active and engaged, then freely die, is beyond me. You might consider though that these demands are usually responded in a forward way by us. We move mountains to find more grain, destroy nations to become more secure, and prudently eat and train as to get better sleep and earn more rest. Can't you see how our compulsion is to act as our nature has ordained? "That skin cannot be burnt without a cost is representative of our nature; it seems only sensible that the presence of that also has a means to avoid this, so that if it is burning it will move away."
            <br>&emsp;The point I am trying to make is that we are always doing something, at least things are happening to us. We are trying to survive for not even our stubborn minds could proceed or assent to no air or food; a lack of action though also sets you into a weighed down state, as if you have no more lift. "It just seems like there isn't anything that we are not doing." We are always in motion, or mildly so, or at unease as the mildness becomes so much. With all of this action then, it seems right that it would reward us with a result proper to our nature. As our body feels at rest when it is free from danger, as does a relative amount of relief come when there is no longer pain, or the source of it has been removed at least, so too will the complexities of a well formed and mature life yield you with the same principal sorts of pleasure and content. The thing is, is that our time is more bent towards the latter. We cannot settle into the satisfaction and clarity that comes from the troubles and concerns of primitive times. Our path is free, with nothing but the fear of idleness or responsive tradition ahead. What is better is a hard thing to say, yet we can generally agree what it is we'd assume. Regular joy, righteous confidence and regard, safety by virtue of personal and civil respect, and so much more. All actions ought to point us towards this, at least we may describe what is furthest and highest as having these attributes present.

        <div id="beginningsend">
            Pardon me, but I am no academic. That’s not to say that I don’t respect what people of science and education do, rather I am merely a thinker. In that way, I may speak about things that they formally see or explain otherwise. Philosophy is a good example. As a branch of learning, it technically means love of wisdom; in parts, it is formally split into metaphysics, knowledge, logic, ethics and aesthetics. For me though, I tend to use these elements as they particularly are, and regard philosophy as a general care and approach for thinking. This in effect runs contrary to what ‘a’ philosophy is, in that it is a systematic approach to understanding the world, that usually defines itself on the basis of those prior elements.
            <br>&emsp;To me however, such a complete end suggests that you haven’t cleaned the table. “For how could you confine everything in truth, if confinement hadn’t been done already? Who holds the mold!” The limits here are themselves implicit, but I can say that history more clearly illustrates the picture. If a model is to accurately reflect living and the world, then it will be perfect when we say that its depiction is complete. Definitively, elements of a perfect entity can only be shifted around, not altered. “For if a dress flaps in the wind it is no less perfect; if a spill hits its side, or if an additional strand is added, then the form of it has changed.” Now, we can see how past models have been added onto or adjusted, or simply made anew in the vision of the old; or an original one at that. The point, is that even though Aquinas and Kant had all rights to claim and or be praised as sound in their thinking, has more not become known. Or, at least, have additions and developments not been made? The progress of Aristotelian thinking namely reflects the former while phenomenology, psycho-analysis, modern physics and mathematical logic appropriately reflect the latter. What I mean, is that the advances in chemistry(per say) by those great advents and discoveries in the enlightening world, were not in themselves a complete view of the world, chemically.
            <br>&emsp;The most difficult thing then, as a limit would be in place, is how can one know or see if more additions are to come. That is, how will we know if our model is complete? One mistake to avoid is in addressing our state of progress now as one which will sooner or later reach a state where the advancements are done -as this really just amounts to the same. A conditional question is useful then. “If we are to be finished with a complete model, then no more alterations will be done. We may lift it up and spin it around, rub out some cracks and refine its edges, but new parts or restitching will mark a new form.” Importantly, we must recognize that those further alterations may be in fact regressive or progressive. “As the Greeks attempted to understand the world using geometry and rational consensus, so did the religions that follow make their own additions and form using millennial scripture and custom. We can at least say that these are at most complete on their own, but incompatible as being the correct view of truth. For there can only be one.” That is perhaps the proper portrait of these thoughts, that is, what marks the correct view of the world?
            <br>&emsp;The question though needs more refinement, as we must be clear as to whether we are trying to explain how things could ever be and how they came to act and form, or if we are trying to assess what is good for us to do? There is a murky line as I see it where one thinks that if the answer were known, or the view was correctly seen, then proper action would ensue. Two core problems arise from this thinking. One, is that we are in some way giving ourselves too much credit by thinking that an accurate model was placed before the embodiment of truth was known. And Secondly, that upon acting upon this model and ingraining its experience, that more would not become impressed upon you, or revealed that is, and consequently prompt the change of the model. My suggestion is that there is a better way. First, let’s admit two things. One, is that this line of questioning and insight is merely a mark of discourse; that is, we are merely illustrating the world, rather than defining what all its constituents mean. Practically then, we can ignore the agents within this model, and rather focus on the framework itself. “For that is what discourse is for, to make reason rather than claims. At least these should come after, but are therein reminiscent of resolve. In that case though, ought we have configured a measure.” Secondly, is that base assumptions in our process here will be admittable. For one, we are shackling ourselves to details that bear no assembly to our search for the truth. This is not to say that they are irrelevant to the truth itself, ‘but where paintings will go on the wall is better concerned after the house is built and painted’. Moreover, and moreso I’d say, is that we are by definition coming from a place that is ignorant. Seeing as our quest is to know, then something is strictly lacking. What we need then is an approach which does not halt its progress because either some screw fell out or some flap came off and makes the model unappealing. “Let us construct the landscape from back to front; there, we can develop the most depth, and more successfully add minor additions -as they will have a world to fit in.”
            <br>&emsp;Let’s take these points of guidance under our wing as we advance. As a mark though, the question is here in place. Coming from a place of imperfection, and seeing as we can basically assume that we are mere rational animals who will continue to be so and at most benefit from knowing the truth -as opposed to being more able to run the system, like we were God planning a project- then we can for the most part see what our model of the truth needs to be. Simply, we need to have the best depiction of the world as we know it that marks the best assembly it can be. If truth still needs to be found, we’ll find it; we need not despair or give up because there is room to go. We also shouldn’t bolt ourselves down into our current steps under the notion that ‘these next ones will get us there, finally’. This expectation suggests either that you will be evidently wrong and that further steps are required, or that you are anticipating stopping upon completing the model. “And that forgoes the ethical notion that upon cementing the frame, you’d use it.”  
            <br>&emsp;The basic premise for all of our inquiry though is what is our reasoning for? And I believe that it is only to those relevant that must answer the question, and bear the answer from all others; and is it not the commonly accepted response that the end of our reasoning is so we can better live? To me, it seems sufficient to live with the best model that we have and make use of it the best we can. “For in some ways life comes after learning. And won’t the former become free and flourishing on its own, and in effect disregard the model?” Perhaps then we could explain our issue with or frustration from the state of progress, that we neither apply it or mean to. It is so clear that we are only giving us more time and space to live; yet we never use it. “Like a field built for us to but we never run.” The discussion then can be summarized. Is there a limit to knowledge, or better said is there a point where it can be complete? Even if at heart there is so, then we ought to ask how and when we’ll live with the model as it is at any point. This is where philosophy ends and the curation for living begins: in that, is our nature and its congenial inquiry. “What ought we do now specifically seeing as the measure is done? The end, to me, is worth knowing more than preparing the model. For that latter ultimately comes by those attempting the former.”

        <div id="adultbend">
            Talking about the course of our lives is difficult. On a macro scale you have the whole, which is principally limited, but by virtue of our tissue, tends towards a tranquil end. Still, the portions of this living part can be broken up into eras (such as adulthood or seniorhood), stages (such as young or old adulthood, or one’s younger childhood compared to their youth), then periods (such as the strands of your highschool stage, or infant portion of your kid years compared to those when you could actually run). On the micro scale the largest unit is a chapter -which in effect comes together to form a period. This is more or less a year, but is in any case less than a period and more than a season. Spring and Summer (as seasons) are what we call batches, quarters if you will (of the chapter that is), while stretches mark portions of this, and sets as pieces of those. Stretches are akin to the first few weeks of a new school year, followed by the stretch from autumn till the new years. The first stretch of summer vacation is another example. Sets, are the smallest strands -as we need not account for any given day, or inch for that matter. These amount to moments of your life, such as a week long trip, or a work week in general. A tournament is a good example too.
            <br>&emsp;Something to consider is that instead of purely breaking our lives into these corresponding parts, how could we reflect on our present scenario with respect to any length of strand. This is hard to do as each measure is not purely a point that is marked when surpassed, rather it is more akin to a gradient, or heart of change, and varies so with respect to the distance at hand. In other words, we can work our way up by virtue of splitting from the whole, but how can we be at any given point then look back, and see where each stretch began?
            <br>&emsp;For me, my youth ended when I was about 19 and I had fallen off the whirlpool of juvenile entitlement and resolve. At that point I entered the world and put myself on display. As it stands, I am reaching that point where that mold is settling, or coming to fruition rather, as a viable means of ground floor action. Better said, I am becoming complete, and able as a point of origin wherein full works and efforts can be done. “Put another way, my state as a man is fully calibrated, and I can now live and be from the heart of that -as opposed to using a bent tool.” In that way, our adolescence is coming to a close, and correspondingly the era of childhood. What this leads into is unclear, but I can at least say that it is the beginning of the bulk of our lives: real adulthood.
            <br>&emsp;“Having grown into myself, I’m a man, and in being so can act and instate all that comes from someone able to fully do; and upon our finish of that, will our ending days begin, whereby I retire into the realm of a post-me existence: for in that, had I already been totally so.”
            <br>&emsp;The period is tough, or at least it is much less clear. On the basis that our current stage began when I started to place myself into the world, that can be our domain. I can reflect that a clear change came when we transitioned away from the novel idea of being on our own, to the point where we saw that duty was our fortune. And following that, with the remark that most that followed was positive, I can see how a great deal changed when we started to live more objectively. Now, you might say that if the era is done when your actions are from completed grounds, then so too would the corresponding stage similarly begin. We must be clear though that this point, at least within this discussion, is not one where we then look ahead and consider what we’ll do upon this full maturation. Rather, as I suppose, or say at least for the sake of addressing the unkown, that we reached this state of being who we fully are when we reconciled what that full person would be. That is how our objectivity began, wherein we reflected what we truly sought, and as the period progressed we deliberated how such claims would be executed. By definition -again for the sake of having one- we will say that the man is one who acts fully, whereas the prior stage of adolescence and according period of objectivity, marks the leading strand that brought the pre mature person into a calibrated state, rather than a point where he could ‘then’ be truly calibrated.
            <br>&emsp;In other words, by assessing who we are and how we mean to be, is where we fully become who we are as we are accurately set for actions that appropriatley reflect us -upon which the execution marks our founded steps. So, breaking down this stage of realization, we can say that the one that follows is colored by the demonstration of that fully realized self. And in terms of the prior periods (respectively) of adventure, roles and aims, the one that follows is either actively dressed within manufacturing -by our active lane ahead- or the principle self regard ‘that we are all that counts’, which our actions outwardly follow. “In other words, all that there is, is that which comes from us, the ends of which mark little in terms of what further things you could achieve, rather the solid line of forever being yourself.”
            <br>&emsp;Seeing as this era is one of true execution, we could sensibly suppose that one of the stages will bend itself on the focus of giving. Whereas this current point at least is about us being the greatest version of ourselves, so too will there be a day when that expression is not so outwardly in how your generous, rather to a small group of people, a family, or specifically a child. As we see it, the end of your adulthood is the point where complete actions are done; and so at the point where a mind for others is placed, then so too will this fit in line with our current place. Furthermore, we might briefly say, with respect to rearing at least, that our goal was to guide them to a place where they can be the greatest version of themselves. And not to digress but let’s say that preceding this is a similar kind of attention to others, but onto one of marital affection as opposed to training. In any case, for each let’s say, they are gradients of what mark you giving yourself, as opposed to at first fully being yourself.
            <br>&emsp;Overall, in fully being ourselves, and thus giving to a friend, a lover and a child, will we have been who we are fully. Perhaps the world can follow, but really is marked in the need of a man. As I see, what that means is one who has reached a point where they can fully be to another; and seeing as what the world needs, it is the sensible ability for all to be themselves. “So let’s not be complacent about that in ourselves, for in doing so the world will see true green.”
        </div>
        <div id="sweetqualities">
            Never will an aim be surpassed as our current need. Per our natures, our experience is always occurring, and as a consequence fairs nothing more than what we hope to claim. In other words, that our time was joyous and pleasing -while serving us with regular amounts of quality rest and ease- bares us the measure in which things are judged. “And I say thanks to all those which effortlessly follow, staking themselves in with simplicity and grace, and treating us to a crushing blow of mere cheerfulness and respect. And nothing short of that.”
            <br>&emsp;That being said, we must deliberate about what it is that will bring us down this lane. If we were birds then flying would be our bend, and as such we might see a place most suitable for that as one placed congenially for us. As men, we are rational; moreso, are we generous, pure and kind. As such, we can regard these as our highest qualities; that is, if such peaks were reached and spoken from, then all foremost could be said. It is true that absolute specks fair less than milder gems, but to our top we can at least amend. “By virtue at least, of doing what is right well, even if through an approach that humbly stays premature as to be full fledged then: but still with those truer starting grounds in mind -as we make ahead.” Again, our strongest base comes from a place of reason and tribute, whereby we incorporate the world around, and position ourselves excellently, then bring ourselves forward as if a suited screw for this greatest groove -as made by reason that is. And in being so fit, and for practicality sake with constance -as to lastingly experience the pleasure of fitting the mold- will our actions flower, as if nectar and fruits from the solid bark of a well rooted tree.
            <br>&emsp;“And to all those who would disagree, or condemn even, on the basis that such stable grounds are not worthwhile as our claim, I would say that looking further in will bring even further gains, both in the firmness of the roots, the according base for the tree -and its trunk- and those corresponding fruits and flowers.” Such prominence blossoms beyond a point that can’t be identified, as real substance and shape takes suit, and allows then for sharing to occur. While initially, principles may be hard to explain, and thus encourages judgment or ridicule -as if we were stale and short- remaining clear and set to such grounded ways will bring out the rewards you seek, which can then reflect things worth relating on.

        <div id="lushdomain">
            When it comes to identities, our thinking and qualification vary. Prior to this though, there are two relevant truths. First is the principle of positivty, which says that regardless of your aim that something ‘positivte’ ought be achieved. This means that if your a sadist, diplomat, missionary or man, that the ends to your actions should be positive. Furthermore, we could appropriatley qualify this by saying that the results should come regularly, easily and with substance; moreso could we say that as these aspects continued and increased, whilst contrary aspects whithered away, that our positivity was improving. Specifically, if we are cooking, a roast lets say, and for simplicity sake we might say that a burnt one is poor while a flavorfull juicy one is right, then for an instant would that latter mark a positive end, whereas if acorss a stretch of time (despite this initial score) that the results were more like that former, then so to could we say that our results are depleting -and becoming negitive that is. Thats rule one.
            <br>&emsp;Since that was a sound amount of detail, I’ll be more concise in the second principle. Simply, we have no beliefes, only positions. That is, upon any prompt or view there are relevant sides; and to each one, there are strenghts and weakness’s regarding what we’d hope to achieve. For example, are gun rights laudible? Well, defining what the rights are, and what they otherwise wouldnt be, then speaking to their worth (or lack their of), illustrates fully to how the situation really is. For one we’ll leave the identity and value for later. All I wish to say is that when it comes to seeing something as good or bad, it is onyl so for some reaosn, and usually this sprouts from some value, or desire rather, to which the choices at hand are weighed against. Moreso, if we do in fact side with one postion, we can still recognize the nature of the other half; moreover, if our side appears to be weaker (on account of its many weakness), we could still reamin firm to the strenght we had (and how it perhaps outweights the contrary.) It would be as if a risk were being taken, and although the other side offered a route which was secure, that this firey path was worth the reward.
            <br>&emsp;In other words, this is a considerate path, although one which is not fully developed. That is so because even though thhis method better explains the ways of the choices at hand, so too our we premature in our actual decision. Commonly, people are moreso in oppostion, and to their own side stubborn, rather than having made a weighted decision. The background though of the subjects in question paints a better picture, as seeing as they are for the most part political, our vote seems to be action at hand. Conversation is important, but only so more genuine votes are casted. And so by your own token or that through the influenece of another (or too them), ought it come and go by real education, or sense rather onto the topic in question. I say most if not all of this because there seems to be little real discussion at hand; and although I admitt that our own sensible views are not being put out there, I also dont think myself absent from the chaos in question. Instead, I ought to be bigger and better, as to shine brihgtly yet sincerely, and in that provide room for a proper disucssion. “I dont feel bad about being to imperfect to overcome the mobs: and explicity I claim that taking part with that aspect, is random and at best awkwardly revlent. And the path to something finer (and impactfull) need not share that path.”
            <br>&emsp;I guess, in short, when it comes to a proposition or some favor you find in something, it only amounts to a strenght you find in it, or (as if it were an alterantive) it lacks the weakness from something else. In part, and perhaps, the coward in me rests on the laurels of fidelity, whereby I claim that knowing completely is uncommon amidst your awarenss of yours and others strenghts, and weaknesses. “How else could a position be had.”

        <div id="boundofcontent">
            What is best? Well that clearly means what is the most positive experience. “Or at least, absolutely -whereby a slant against would be equally not so- what experience is (more or less truly and completely) positive.” For one, the relevant answer angles itself according to the subject at hand. “A positive experience of a shark is that it would survive, and at most thrive.” For men though our condition is the same, yet for practicality’s sake the concern is even further. As it were, stability has accrued, of which our industry should be commended. But whereas we fought against the elements in order to live, this at most meant that we were alive before death. But now that this escape is absent, so too does our path lead to the same end. However, whereas before we were engaged with getting by, now we are in a sense waiting. And from this life seems pointless, as the absence of struggle gives us nothing to do.
            <br>&emsp;Man is a tricky subject, as all other species fall into the category of surviving. An important point is that when they are safe and situated, they graze. The crux of our concern falls into play then, as we in our similar states feel poor, whereas those of the herd (chewing cud) feel suitably docile. The simple reason is that whereas those in the mud rest happily above their core need to survive, we (increasingly) sit back into such passive living, whereby the freedom above -by virtue of danger’s absence- dangles her active hopes ahead. For the cow is not really absent from death or danger when he is wandering the fields, he is merely in a place content with the present moment of lacking alarms. In other words the stress is coming, and thus peace is ever appreciated. We on the other hand have little that crosses our way; at least, things to do with us that scream with apparence when their lacking. Though, hearing about the world illustrates nicely how such passivity is hard to claim, and that upon that, grazing would be favorable. That is neither here nor there, as we are talking about a well footed place void of the perils of tigers and famine. And at that point the query rises, as to what we are going to do. “For unless we see such freedom as temporary, then waiting is off the table. And if the road ahead is expected to be clear, then not driving on it feels idling and stiff.”
            <br>&emsp;The question I have, is whether it is alright to be content with me. Ought I run forth because the world is so free, or should I cultivate the ability to live more on these stable grounds? I am of the utmost belief that each side really hopes for the same, and that the single measure that defines such end is sincerely represented by that latter statement. As it were, we are trying to be ourselves. Whereas a fish is complete when its gills are running and its stomach is full, so to as Man, are we in line and checked when the saturates of our mind leave us without any sturring, and instead a wonderment of cheer and awe, grounded to. And as such, our peace and tranquility, evenness and strength, solidify us as being the right way. “For in other words, a looseness to such completion would be appropriately described by a lack of said qualities.”
            <br>&emsp;And so for the sake of expression, running wild and free may bring a larger kind of measure; and that if our world is truly free then so should this account for us really being ourselves. The key thing to remember is that upon that outer advancement, only more will fill the role. And as such, ought we wonder how we can truly be forever, rather than reaching for a point which may seem obvious -as it brings clear excitement- but prevents any sustenance of its point, or any lasting amount below.
            <br>&emsp;Our lives should have width, truly, as this reflects us demonstrating ourselves, whereby in turn our desire draws us to see more, while in the process sharing. Consequently, you bring more to the table, to which others join, and the meal is thus larger and more enjoyed. But we must humble ourselves with the knowledge that such offerings only come naturally, for if we are premature in our push, and in other words forcing the draw, then so too will the kind of things we bring (and seek) be lesser, which in effect allows for the good to be less wide, or lasting -in overall duration or severity.
            <br>&emsp;Our true estimate should be who we truly are, and this should account for the lasting success we seek, and in turn one that addresses their current state. Specifics are important, but we should fret over the knowledge that our wings have fledged, or that there is no one to even share the current fruits. And that’s o.k, for such caliber of ends is approaching; and in turn, the expression from there will be in itself complete, and in accordance broad. If we rush for this happening early, we’ll simply fall over. “And who would be jealous of that.”

        <div id="therightfit">
            Any end is marked well by its favorable substance, regularity and ease of accessibility. A crucial question though is who we are as to find such things for alignment. In other words, the best fit will be the one which happens firmly, neatly and often. The question, is what sort of screw we are and as such what groove will fit that. Moreover, can we discern this by those generalizations of what any good groove will be: for we may otherwise have to vet murder before defining it as bad.
            <br>&emsp;Now, it is true that culture and tradition raise us to inhabit certain lanes, and that by virtue of our inquiry we may not actually be fit for what is of the norm. Even if something is normally done, it may only be done so poorly and does not otherwise reflect a poor focus. In that sense, I see death, family, leisure and self regard as the crux of our lives. And as I have thoroughly experienced, a lack of respect and or grasp on these elements will produce alternate motions, such as indulgence, deceit, contempt, repulsion, depression and impotence. To be clear, the strands of these segments are not so explicitly poor in and of themselves, only it is all too common that their execution matches the rubbish of the domain; in other words, we may eat and drink well, however poor in quality, but if we are reckless and or stupid about it, then so too do our lesser ways drag us down -as opposed to being pecks and tears in our otherwise well behaved constitution.
            <br>&emsp;A further point of importance is that our respect for the crucial elements of our lives generally bring us away from things which happen to run contrary. As it were, if we mean to live well through fitness, then our constancy and care for that naturally separates us from flattening activities. So in our death, that if infamy and shame were to be humored, then so would it be at the cost of ignoring our truer end. And that pretty much explains it, that things tend to go one way at the cost of another; it isn’t so much that we would prefer to travel and adventure, but choose our family otherwise, rather if we bent towards that latter and heeded those fruits, then so too would our pallet lose interest and respect for the former. Who we are then may be defined as ‘what is congenial for us, to which our mold is described’.
            <br>&emsp;Who we are though has more principle patterns. This is difficult because our place is almost primarily born from an ignorance of these effects, but so much as we have been thoughtful and directed ourselves towards a better way, so have these elements become clear as the root cause. Simply, our breathing and its susceptibility to food, exercise and sleep, as well as the impact (by these) on our seating, strength and activity -such as walking or trotting. And at any rate, we could say that as we drink, so do we train less, which brings our body into a more flappy state, of which the unable consequences cause us to drink because our better means are destroyed; on the flipside, as we run more, so does our body settle into a firmer state, whereby interest and leisure sprout, and cut away from baser desires that would otherwise flatten our day.
            <br>&emsp;In short though, we can say that all these come together, as sugar makes our aerobics shortened, so does our strength incorporate nourishment better, to which in either case the according effect reinforces itself by virtue of the according rewards. I will say though that working to these from that point of family and death -under the guise of general quality- is much harder, as for the most part these baser elements are uncovered by reflection, as opposed to more evident reasoning.

        <div id="rightfullhammer">
            If I were to ask the purpose of pushups as compared to bench press, I would say that one yields robustness while the other offers power. Whether you prefer one or the other is its own matter, but as scales no less or at least molds for judgment, we could say that for each (of the subjects) their purpose is to one, or are at least conducive for those respective qualities.
            <br>&emsp;Another question, regards the assessment of the item at hand, for how do we know what pushups offer, and thus what their purpose is? And to get to the primary factors, we’ll remove for the moment any concern for modulation -as in accompanying elements which alter the pushup. Perhaps the realm of assessment needs its own fortuity, but at the very least we can act from assumptions that cater to our intent. That is, if we are addressing certain exercises in terms of their promise of fitness, then we can discern (by this instance) that one is closed chained while the other is open. From here, we can infer that heavier weights will go well with the latter, while a more firm and and even use of the entire body will accompany the former. By these, we will simply describe them as burly and robust. More or less we can say what each one does.
            <br>&emsp;Where purpose comes in, is when we evaluate each entry by their relevance to our aim. So for argument’s sake, we may have previously considered whether brutish strength is favorable to solid rigor; and coming to grips with the constancy and accessibility of the latter, we lather our grooves with that, which is to say that we make ourselves welcoming and interested in things and their kind which fit this value. Now, linguistically, we may intuit that robustness and burliness serve as useful descriptive measures -as to reflect the care for such strength or rigor. Looking at the nature of pushups and bench press, we can see how the closed chain conduct of the former leads to such robustness (and as such the solid rigor we seek). In that, we may assent to pushups, and as such consider their purpose in meeting the requirements in which we evaluated on. Moreso, we may only do this for the moment, as the longevity of the pushup is always up for re-evaluation, or assessment at least -as its merits may lower, or otherwise offer us poor results which strike us as reason for removal. And similarly too for the aspects of flavor and accessibility.
            <br>&emsp;On the whole then, we can use familiarity and intuition to describe the various objects in the world. Then, as if we were picking candidates, we can weigh them against the qualities we seek -again, with continuing room for assessment and evaluation. And at any rate, we may in fact use our reasoning and wit to discern the actual truth in our personal matter, that is whether or not our qualifiers are wrong. As it were, we are in the realm of thinking, which is to say that our concerns and performance sprout from due regard and care, as opposed to passively (and or primitively happening). Almost by definition, has the prevalence of the latter been utmost, while the former aspect trickled slowly upward. The remains of that which is primitive still coats our modern minds though, and as such warrants reputable means for directing our attention properly. “For the animal still rests inside, nor are we in our best and most sensible moments exempt from the natural limits of organic being.” Accordingly, out we think about the merits of our qualifiers, as opposed to simply being attentive to things which hold up to futile worries.
            <br>&emsp;In our life we are limited. And in terms of who we are in such a range, are we both thinkers and makers, that is one’s who consider and adapt, both in personal and communal ways. By this token, be it on our own or with others, ought we be free and welcomed to live accordingly. That is, if we are burdened then let’s use our strength and wits to overcome it, or bear it at least. And if we are welcomed to more liberal ends, then let us apply those in our dearest ways; that means truly looking up at the stars, or at least being refined and definite onto what (in your sensible freedom) draws you; then, as if it were a problem to solve, meet the heights of your reverence with true industry and expression, ‘all under the notion that this is viable, pleasing, meritable and sound’. That more or less orbits around us as the right directive, to which our reflection and deliberation can persist -whereby we assert more personal and operative qualities.
            <div class="qu">For me, our own life at hand can be best described from an earlier quote. That is, ‘the qualities of living for me are reputable actions, one’s of industry, one’s of pure and cheerful engagement, along with the reverent and or pleasing asides from both worldly demands and environmental beauty.’</div>
            As we said, these are our scales, and in terms of which areas we should vet, or what is otherwise pressing on me as the one with the instrument in hand, does reverence and adaptability apply. For the jobs we have are not truly of interest to me, yet their offer of provisions makes them appropriate to regard. The ends which they support make this so, as the elements and or subjects which fit into our molds of industry, worldliness and cheer, shine as the righteous lights which warrant such sensible amends. “As I say, being gracious for the lands and world around is quite easy, when in fact my mere presence earns me the living and stable means for those given ends.”

        <div id="basisforends">
            There ought to be a word which remarks the incompatibility of some action, and thus a relief of feeling inferior or halted at heeding it as a desire. Perhaps that is what wisdom is, but still a distinction can be made.
            <br>&emsp;We say with great confidence that all aims bank themselves on results which are regular and of substance. Simply, a contrary subject would be that if such qualities were not in place. This seems a mark of intelligence, as we are being quite considerate of what our life and time would be in general, whereas wisdom seems more like a siv, whereby we run things through this measure and see how they hold up. In that sense, wisdom evaluates based on our reasonable scale; science however, or that which investigates, identifies what things are, and we as well, so that their flavors can be properly placed, and consequently assigned a measure of worth.
            <br>&emsp;I will stand on this, and feel no problem in casually saying it is necessary, but just as there is no real good or bad without some sort of scale, so is their depiction of this without a nature to a host and the objects around. If we identify candy as being full of sugar, and of the crumby kind, how is this in any way poor to those who would not incur irregularity and coarse substance? I’m not going to say a rock has values, but for example the rawness of meat is acceptable to carnivores, yet for us it is not. Would we say that such a thing was inherently bad? Well perhaps with respect to the one affected by it, but in that we must know who that is. We know by what’s evident that a lion can eat a gazelle, while we (with some evidence but intuition no less) realize or are at least fine to accept (by that probable suspicion) that eating such a thing in an equal way is false. Wisdom doth seem like a string which would lead us to where things obviously go. Our assessments may in fact be wrong, but this does not change their use, for if we deem it to be a ceratin way and in that there appears a wrong connection, then we’ll avoid it. This calls on our investigation to be well founded, and for practicalities sake angled on our shortcomings in being truly so, to which we can humbly amend -or at least find ways to determine the accuracy within things.
            <br>&emsp;Case in point, whether we see it as divinity or natural resolve, we will act, and perhaps if we are primitive then so will those accordinlg sensitive, color the mold which means to be filled. Judgment though seems to easily put the two together, for if our baser impulses are given the regard, and our deduction concluded that dirt was the best suiter, then we’d try it at least. It would follow that convincing yourself that it was in fact sweet -when the staleness in your mouth proved otherwise- but the proceedings still follow.
            <br>&emsp;I’d reference Descartes’s early notion that men lack nothing more than the application of reason, as opposed to how much reason they have. Our minds may be dull and quickly jump to an end, but this is more likely to result in the basis for our decision, and how well we decide what things are. For it is true that things may be conceived poorly, but not strictly against a complimentary impulse, as we may in fact seek righteous ends -or at least ones thought about- but our inspection as to what is congruent may be false -or poorly founded at least.
            <br>&emsp;And so I sit here not with the mind to tell you that choosing an aim or aligning with what seems preferable is an opportune action, as I already see you living in this way. What we must do is erect a higher caliber of sensitivity, for on the basis of what’s regular so will the desires of our baser natures fail. “Seeing as they are in most ways definitively bent towards what is quick and easy.” And too, that if we are even so, that we would be true in our inspection. It seems that all things have an apparent nature, even if we haven’t identified it. But I imagine that if peace and probity were not defined as our sought for aim, then those things which we’d adhere to for some other end would not in fact last. For we may be idle bums who respond with an intention for business, but which lasting and sincere end will this produce?
            <br>&emsp;Considering the well of genuine desires, ought our resolutions lean towards that? If excitement and gratuity is all we seek, for it may in fact be in contrast to our meek frivolity, does it stack up on those baser commands of regularity and substance? For even if moments of improvement are gained from these avaricious ways, are they constant, fresh, reputable, of worth to others or the regard you have for yourself? As a model, I care not whether it’s linear, for in forgoing so we can root ourselves in those basics of regularity, surrender to the flavors of solidity and evenness as compared to brazen strength and burliness, and congregate around the world and its ways which respond to this, whereby those which are good are those which we determine to fit by those purer qualities.

            The world is a bundle of rocks, with an atmosphere in part because of the way it formed. Whereas it now has trees and oceans, other local planets do not. Through industry, such places could be inhabitable, but there is likely no indigenous tribes. So for now, we can say that Earth is our domain.
            <br>&emsp;Statewise, the world has advanced from major civilizations spanning whole continents, to more segmented republics, or nations rather, which border eachother akin to a puzzle. For some time, historically at least, there was fighting between these as there were between the empires of old, but those days have settled. The point being, that you are likely a member of one of these states, and usually at home within a nested province. Moreso, are you part of a territory, and a region within that. In a timely manner we may often travel around to this extent -along with brief ventures past those grander borders- but commonly, our life is lived in neighborhoods. Again, work may have us commuting an hour or so, or perhaps for the sake of some excursion, but otherwise we probably at most go to the store or dentist, or friend’s house too. In that case, we live in districts -which act as the parts of a region- and admittedly our lives may extend past this -for either demand or leisure- but is generally for a moment: the heart of our day is spent in our home, or nearby at least, which is stated by a neighborhood and the particular block of ours on it.
            <br>&emsp;Now, merchants can travel those higher borders regularly, as can those of official status; their business is merely that though, and however novel and fair the destinations and adventure are, their accessibility to such is rooted in the occupation to do so. “And as a point of reason, that being joyfully engaged is worth more than a heads down trip to Tokyo.” That is the far of extent to it though, as people may otherwise have crafts that they’ve made lucrative enough whereby they can venture around -for the sake of inspiration, or scenery to work in front of. And this is nice, but almost nearly as local as ours. It is true that entertainers and (more or less) journalists -and content creators of the sort- have the freedom to be where they want and do as they please -within their bounds at least, for simplicity, but their roots are dug deep within constancy; and so the thing which they do the most (and often) is really the heart of their effort and reward. So, even if they can travel nationally, or simply around the province, their work is carried with them. And so, like the merchant who brings their billings with them, so too does this artist and creator. To be clear I prefer the latter, and as a bearing for what would be good in our lives, of it I see a fair end. But we must remember that it and all other kinds of completion take time and devotion, and that in being so removes the childish center of our lives, and instead places the onus on us; or in other words, we are dealt what we have locally, be it stable or moving, as opposed to believing that our destiny is to be spoken, or rather (simply) that who we are at heart and kind is what will be heard and rewarded, as opposed to the sensible place of you being with yourself -and those close around.

            Take a disc: well consider this our area, or plot rather. Now add some height to it, as if we were making a cylinder. Concerning a metric, we might say that each slice is according to that, be it a year or a moment. Now, consider the earth (of recent times) and its occupation by man. In one area, say France, you could see how the slices progressed from the Germanic tribes to the Gauls, then into Renaissance France and the Post Napolean Era. If you asked what France was, you might respond with what it is today. But imagine if you asked a person who they are, and that their account withheld, or at least gave no regard for their prior development. You might as well say we’re baking a dish, and it’s almost a bit hotter. No, we’re cooking a steak, but as a full one, that’s what we mean, and so as it hits the pan, it is becoming something which even upon a further step of progress, remains. Better said, becoming 10 counts up from 1, but 2 still keeps the aim.
            <br>&emsp;I say this because, geographically (and the according societies) at each point there is a pillar which runs down. Land wise this continues for hundreds of thousands of years, and even though the pieces of the plot eventually change, so does the fact remain that slices above and below are laid. Now, as we said you can take a ring, from China let’s say, and carry it up from the Shang till the Republic. This seems sound in regards to China on the whole. “And being wholesome reflects how well were founded.” The criticism offered (and applicable) to most, is that they A) forgo such heights of consideration, and instead take a slice appropriate to their claim, but two -and to me most importantly- they don’t fail to make this mistake across the whole of the plots. That is, if we assessed America by its place in 1850, Russia in its state in 1922, then added Iraq in 2000, then at different moments we’ve particularly selected. This is an intellectual afront on two sides. I’m not saying we have to account for particle physics in our cooking class, but within the subject ought we be layered -or topically well founded. Secondly, is that across the sum of our lives, ought we be so topically sound at each point. For how could we have a credible worldview, even despite our soundness in one area, and have disregarded the rest? It would be as if we scouted a player in the fullest wayoffering not even that fullness to one-, but(still) left the other candidates (or members at least) in a less concerned fashion, or not at all. Again, to do with me as the player, I am enough, or at least as much as our attention centers on me. But for the team and the sport in general, holes make for equally solid views.
            <br>&emsp;I say all of this because regarding history, were flawed, and the sentiment surrounding race, economics, government, religion, crime, violence and war, philosophy and simple well being, ‘could hold not much more than air’.
            <div class="qu">Which is why we’re so full of it</div>
        </div>
        <div id="mindormatter">
            We simply want to live good lives. Doing so however is no easy feat. For one, it is because we are questioning things prior to their execution; and if I may bring up a root problem, that is whether the principle place for our time is in setting up for better days to come, or living them. “And as men we must be fearless of the fact that we are common, whereas the ability to succeed both is in the realm of God -as he is both mind or matter.” As rational animals though we could say that were more set for the latter, even though we wish for the former. The solution arrives though on that notion, as it is quite common and clear that it is our misfortunes in such material times, that privies our mind to find freedoms of a kind according to that. “It is not for the sake of remedying those mistreatments though; instead, we conjure imagery of a place which would be free and better, of which we illustrate and define as being through the mind -and thus within the realm of God.”
            <br>&emsp;Our reason though tells us explicitly that we are clearly being dishonest. For the pure fact that there is a great way to live in this world, one of which removes the preference and place of such unworldly claims. Banking ourselves on this is perhaps our strongest choice, as our inability to administer our stake under the notion that its frame is within the world and time, makes our place in it bitter and vile. Moreover, will an alternative only appear as pleasing, and drawing to, as well as being the thing which we resolve towards and hope to achieve. For the sake of argument, let us say that either end is true, but with respect to what any course needs, so too will we apply the rule to those. And foremost, or definitively rather, if our bend is towards the realm of mind, then your place in the world will correspondingly recede.
            <br>&emsp;Away is how I would describe it. While on the other hand, our stake within the real world may in fact be limited and brambled, but is into ourselves that we go as much as this is so. In other words, bends describe a slant which sees no farther than what’s right up the road, but the path is unclearly seen. Our wish though is to proceed that way with the hopes on offer. If that route is unworldly, then we are becoming further away from ourselves, whereas the approach towards worldly matters is a central one, for that is where we already are. “Less one thought that their advance to heaven was not from a lower level.” And seeing as those according wishes usually come from the ground -for the aim above- then so too will we see then that our hopes to achieve wonderful living of those material planes, is one where we simply settle into where were presently at. For me, that wish for Mind over matter is one where we reach beyond ourselves. And the impetus isn’t wrong, nor would we say that an otherwise oblige would not require strict maintenance. But even through our doubts and all that our ambitions bring -regardless if it is of Eden or the world’s spring- so too in this earth warren pasture of green, do we settle into ourselves, as if our discontent is reproached from. And as God is meant to be given faith too, or in other words the gifts of heaven and surety of man in this realm is not to be taken for granted -or overstepped upon- then so too will our rocky affairs task us with being gracious and humble, hence the reproach beneath our discontent. However, the thing which is true for each, is that upon appropriate advance and treatment, will the person gain what they actually seek.
            <br>&emsp;As far as I’m concerned, the claims of that worldly promise have been given relatively small definition, nor has the alternative been given any genuine criticism against the fact if that former was true. Arguments against theism surely exist, but they’re merely saying that such ends could not happen; but there merely denying it, as opposed to saying what it runs in contrast to. And as much as they do, they fail to illustrate those truer heights in comparison to those peaks which are fabricated.
            <br>&emsp;So what could we say in some sort of summary? Well, it is clear that mindful resolves are in contrast to those of real being. The thing is, is that the latter’s ends are ones of real action, while the kinds of the former are mental. The problem, is that we are still best to think about the means and ends of the world. And so, whereas the affairs of the environment may press themselves upon us, and thus encourage us to look towards some further place via our mind, the affairs of remaining in the world still come with their lower concerns, or reasoning that is, but onto them we are meant to go. Wisdom is a good example here of how poor choices to do with real things cause us turmoil -and the according shift of direction- while frugal, generous, kind, and timely actions avoid such maltreatment, thus keeping us content with the world. Furthermore, is it safe to say that we are not Gods considering whether we should remain in our mindful realm, or transition into that of the world. We are people, mammals, creatures, of matter, and our recognitions are merely through and for the world, however directed onto themselves and corresponding extensions.
            <br>&emsp;In any case, we are generally rooted by our hands and feet, of which our reason guides us. Whereas industry and self reflection can appropriately guide us to use them for a fruitful end, so too we may turn such regards into the realm of abstract ideas -and those corresponding interests. That is why we say that such cares are away from us, as our nature is placed on the ground, and in which our senses operate. This also suggests that even though our mentality has strictly material aims and according aspects, that the otherwise whimsies of worlds and or matter within the realm of the mind itself, seem somewhat faulty and conjured by those baryonic senses.
            <br>&emsp;The question then, is if we have aims for the mind, then our thoughts are directed towards that, but if our stake is of the world, so too are our thoughts towards that. And whereas the path of the former generally fairs one the tasks of patience, as if the illustrations are promising their vision to come, our earthly intent has business for us right now. Or for practicality’s sake, all the time before the priors offer could come to fruition. It must be noted that the heart of this organic path holds it to be true that our death is fair and tranquil. Now, I say this for an important point that our regard for how we proceed in a worldly way, is either banked on the solidity and comfort within the according regards, or if it is more forwardly set on the activities and treatment within the world itself. Put another way, our mind pictures reality in a certain way. If we see it is natural, then we know the end is easy and similar, though our time before can vary. But just as those who believe in God and heaven may feel apprehensive and constricted at the process of reaching it, so too can the man of green, in a contrastingly positive scenario, still be at most confident about the world, and be free from its discontent. “To that earthy heaven though, and the actual graces that its active offer places, that is the front of our minds view of such realm. And the key question is whether it is fine to be spiritually alright through the materially calibrated path, or if it is the actual sights and corresponding gaze, that marks the fuller view.”
            <br>&emsp;It’s really for you to find out and deliver, for whereas those lighter ends have supposed consequences and conditions, our ends are the same. Our place though may not be any more absent of the struggle which pushed others to approach that former, only that during their retched time and preview of paradise to come, their advance and excitement is at least pleasing and positive. The challenge is in figuring whether natural resolutions should be similarly conditioned -in that their hopefulness was the mark of satisfaction- rather than actually experiencing the world’s good. For, as I see it, those in these green pastures who are unable to see it, may in fact have more relevant preventions to them being otherwise pleased. “Whereas those who are religious may in fact be naive and foolish, but still pleased and graced.”

        <div id="minimalmaximums">
            So deductive arguments may in fact be limited, but our use of them reflects that. Unfortunately, it is clear that a disagreement about this flattens both my local and broad appeal, or at least my perceived station. This isn’t so poor, but our future comes into question, or the use of our time rather. These are not so poor when you consider the course which has been identified, but sometimes that route is not so clear, and demonstrating it to others feels appealing; but that scenario seems neither appropriate nor fruitful.
            <br>&emsp;Technically, my error of deduction is in presuming the axioms are correct. Moreover, it is strange that deductions take place as if in an ideal world, but then mean to apply themselves in the real world. That latter can be identified, while the former is transcendent. Still, we act like it’s true, and for good reason. If an identifiable object moves only by some cause, then so too could we imagine that all things came to effect by some starting cause. This brings to light the concept of causality. The problem, is that within the real world, ‘cause’ is not so correct, or at the very least is best illustrated outside that classical view.
            <br>&emsp;The problem, is that if I say that God caused everything because everything needs a cause, so would I reply that only within the idea of ‘cause’ -and its corresponding effect- does this idea reign, as objects themselves are not so bound by the way that term is used. The point though, is in explaining how a result occurs, which by standard definitions is referred to as an effect, while in more accurately identifiable ways, it is at most effect like, but not so in a linear sense. The causality argument that gets through for the sake of theology, marbles the cause and effect in such a linear way; and its weakness is that it assumes that the terms and use of them are being done so properly. I’d say correctly, but in which way is not clear. For we are not Gods, simple. We are merely inferring, or deducing rather, how things are ideally -or perfectly that is. But in that way, we are not giving enough credit, or rigor that is, to anything beyond the simple line of cause and effect. And seeing as such a line would not describe identifiable things appropriately, then I have two conclusions to make. One, is that however sound the deduction is, that it speaks at most to the sheath of reality, rather than its instances, or objects rather. Holy books and what not may be claimed as such instances, and thus true guidance, but at the very least it does not follow how objects are and what we, as inquirers, should do, by deducing that there is a beginning and God. Even if we concluded an afterlife and doing the right thing, of which operations and how is not so clearly given. The second point, and baser one as I see it, is that the deductions being made are ill founded based on their conceptual root born from objective things. As we said, the cause of one thing leads to an effect, and the meta (so to speak) of causality begins; but as we said, real things aren’t suitably described that way, and so -by this second point- I’d say our use of causality is wrong. Results speak to it better, just as entirety describes literally everything, whereas many otherwise presume that ‘the, or our universe amounts to that’.
            <br>&emsp;I think that deductive arguments will always rest outside our valid measure, as their worth is almost beyond doubt, based on the relevant use by the minds considering them -who would consider them as if full, within their bounds, however limited those bounds were, and thus their concepts. But I wouldn’t offer an inch past those root deductions, as however untrue they ultimately are -as we said, beside their local truth- the past point of particular truths -regarding our actions- fairs less so exponentially. This could be angled as a deistic rather than a theistic view, but the point seems irrelevant. The contrast to these deductions is an action, by our actionable nature, sprouted from identifying reality, of which we are part of and a member. Practically, this doesn’t extend our reach beyond our obvious regards, nor is there any ground to introduce ill founded motions that run contrary to that. As a man, my breath is equal to my death, and so when I sleep or find a state of ease, so will eternity be tranquil for me -by our being safe and sound in nothing. The motivations to prove otherwise come from ignorance. And even if they were born from inquiry, and as if a warning to say that such ends were in fact different, I’d say based on what. We could build past these points and concern our deaths as if their essence was no longer identifiable, but the silliness is creeping in, or at least the poorness in claiming how such state is in fact properly identified. For me, referencing reality suggests it’s nothing, nor does my right place in reality drag me from accepting it as so -in fact, if it were even untrue, I’d remiss. But, conceptually, how is one to really propose what such end is like? We can (faultily perhaps) use eternity and causality to prove the necessary existence of an uncreated creator, but this is in a way just mathematics. “Where is this well founded point about what will be built or calculated (on those numerical grounds) coming from?”
            <br>&emsp;A rational animal happily accepts everything, as superstition, absolutism and (more or less) principle eternity bubbles up from the scrutiny, holes and fear in our mind, so I care not. But even if I did, or (which I do) invite those opinions and reasoning, I’m still lost (and waiting) for any point (for that matter), and a good one at that, where the course of our life is uncovered. It would be poor if we just said that we should live well, and even if we acknowledge our place as animals, that assuming what goods of those there were, would still be a point of erection rather than guidance, and qualifying things otherwise simply reflects the living measure of one who is such, but having determined it -by virtue of presuming a positive quality. It’s hard to summarize even a set of objectives based on humanity, economics, geography etc., so it is hard to fully erect -as if the right thing should be done, and that each thing doing what it is meant to do (by virtue of the natural flow of things).
            <br>&emsp;Bring this back, the limits of deduction are such that the concepts their based on may in fact be misplaced due to our limit (or prematurity rather) of understanding the objects which said concepts are based on. We may see event A causes event B, and in general form some idea of causality. And as such, an event becomes a symbol, or condition rather, which we can use to postulate a formula of outcomes that occur based on this or that element. The problem, is that less the world be whole, and considering our aim of defining the whole, it is our own error to attribute the baser concepts to the actions of ostensibly whole objects. Causality of a gun may in fact suppose that the trigger fired the bullet, but these parts are composed of smaller things, atomically if you will. And even those are further defined by the entropy and persistence of space, which to our point, behaves quite differently than our symbols profess. Conceding this point, we would not presume that our logic can in fact encompass the happenings of those finer matters.
            <br>&emsp;The second point regards the fact that our attempts to deduce, and prove otherwise, are both for the sake of understanding the truth and thus our proper actions. In other words, establishing an aim, of which wisdom is given by those who receive clarity to this. The problem, is that even if God were proven, or better said, that our deductions were correct, that applying this and suggesting how we should actually be is false. For one, testimony is quite unreliable, as even it is based on utterances which fall under ‘non-identifiable resolve’. Still, we speak of miracles to support this, and scripture to boot, but these fall flat due to the precise falsity of intervention. Perhaps it is not with an iron fist, but considering that all that there is, is almost definitively a mark of the creator, or at the least the destiny that reflects how things have so far come to be, of which suspension and or intervention is excluded. This is simply by virtue of what we have elsewhere seen, and that besides imagery and suspicion, objects can not be intruded, as by the present impression of thermodynamics and quantum theory, entirety’d explode. And in a way, since that hasn’t happened, then so too can we be sure that nothing occurred that would cause that. Again, we are supposing that the divine is real, and that all things have a plan and are guided, but suggesting that intervention -as if during the process- proclaims validy how we should be with respect to our actions, fairs very little.
            <br>&emsp;It would seem that our rationality and sensibility offer more there instead. And as a righteous defense (in this practical side of the arena) whereby someone might exclaim, ‘so what are we suppose to do then, or is there just no meaning’, we could say, ‘that just as you would identify shortness of breadth and the anticipation of the summer heat, so could you be clear on the description of your death, which upon being nothing, fairs nothing more than that most desirable thing (when it is of the purest form): sleep’.
            <br>&emsp;In short, presuming a larger plan is unnecessary in the same way that a thieve cares not if there was in fact one, for he goes where his desire takes him, to which our wisdom can seek a natural end. Although we are not required to act or be inconsistent for the sake of proving inconsistency, so to can we say that the boat should be pointed this way by the misdirection that deduction and its application otherwise seem. Nature is rising ahead, and despite the many sirens and tempests ahead, so can we be sure and confident that the ride is progressing for our enjoyment, as wherever we go (or get to) so is it the same if we now reach the end.

        <div id="lettingyouknow">
            I feel quite bold in saying this, as writing letters is not a relevant or desired thing. From time to time though, a suspicion in me arises, one which we have in a way shared over the years, but (as often happens) gets covered by more ordinary matters.
            <br>&emsp;Rather than propose something, I only wish to illustrate what’s on my mind. Imagine two scenarios. On one hand, you have a course (in life) which is professionally significant, full of excitement and fun ahead, and generally one which is broadly sociable and rewarding. In contrast, imagine a life which was more isolated, or local we’ll say. Instead of traveling and conversing as in the former, imagine this latter was one of mere privation. Fortune could allow for ventures around, but consider it a more studious and personal life to yourself.
            <br>&emsp;Obviously, the first seems preferable, as who wouldn’t want such elements in their life, or at the very least who wouldn’t want to avoid the material of the latter. I have a second aspect though. Regarding the content -or activity we’d say- of each, where then does the favor lie? I would argue that the professional one, despite having much to do -and perhaps in exotic and or adventurous ways- is much more administrative than you’d realize. Our hopes may be treated, as would we be pleased in staying at a grand hotel, but would our occupations not keep the course of our days somewhat held? And even if we could travel, would it not be for business, or at the very least would we not still have something ‘work-like’ to do throughout the trip? It’s true that we would have other opportunities to travel as we please -or do as we seek no matter- but at what point are we referring to, in that we either have surpassed our place within our career (or business) and are now set to retire? Because if it is otherwise and our role is still present, then would our trips and voyages not be but occasions, or vacations at best?
            <br>&emsp;Furthermore, considering the sort of people we’d be around, what sort of interests would that facilitate, or at least be fostered by the expected discussions? This translates then to that more homely life, whereby one’s personal study of physics, psychology, economics etc., happen (I’d say) more naturally and consistently. It’s not that being a lawyer, technician or entrepreneur bars you from such pursuits, but how level is the road in this case, or at least how much draw is there from such a light when your lenses are born from those former kinds of ambition. “It’s like a chef who familiarizes themselves with all the food and flavor in the world with the intent of sharpening their pallet for wholesome foods -so that they may taste better- and that despite their prudent intent, the care and or interest for such things is replaced by the crap they used for development.” In other words, if we are busy and ordained to a life of number crunching, management, itinerary and the public, what place will there be, or rather what interest will we have, for those personal studies? Adding to that, what about a love of film or games, or recreation of the local, yet explorative kind? What about the great things our handiness and industry want to make, or at the very least, our actual care and regard for developing and existing maturely and with strength?
            <br>&emsp;I’d introduce this most important point that has to do with children -despite its irrelevance right now- that upon their arrival, ought our goods be ready to go and serve. Better said, if such task -of rearing our children, or being part of a family no less- is in a way a test, then which kind of life affords us more than we can offer? Again, it may not seem relevant, but if we have families someday, will anything be more important? And beyond our duties, won’t it be a somewhat pleasurable demand, that we are steady and richened by said experience? Whether it is because we feel good about treating them well, or the sweet joy of our contribution and involvement, is this not -in our later years at least- the aim? Which kind of life would we have that procured this? Is it not a cliche that those in high positions have not but good intentions for their child? But who raises them, teaches, molds them, or is patient even -as you’d still assume some presence. Moreover, what sort of person would you want them to grow to be? Would it not be one who similarly found themselves, and consequently were able and set on offering as such to their families? Would you rather they be businessmen, or artists, thinkers, men?
            <br>&emsp;I am sending this to you because of a thought that I’ve had. For months it’s been trailing behind me, and I thought that by sharing it with you specifically, it would cease its weight-bearing. Effectively, I am not pursuing any business, nor am I set or drawn towards a career or profession. The content that I mentioned pulls me instead, and I am happy and pleased to proceed naturally and gradually for the sake of that. As I see it, the way that science, entertainment and (in general) the world is talked about is akin to the creativity offered by windows vista. “Every point is just stiff and stale.” It’s not the ideas that are lacking, only their depiction, or illustration rather. What I seek, is to learn and teach about these things using Windows 10. That would brighten my day, and is a light I wish to shine. If there is any gems of actual advancement, then so too is that an asset. But otherwise, I am satisfied with the presence of these things in my life, being so bright themselves. If I know it, that is fine, and if others know it then that is exciting. I need not get anywhere though, nor do I wish to pretend like I’m trying. That is what I wanted to say, that I am no longer suspending my efforts for the sake of some future start, ‘when fortune has finally given me room to do so’. Casually, this personal and active state of mind and intention has settled breezily with others around me; because I care not, I find it easy to speak about it in simple ways to co-workers (and strangers), and otherwise my parents are more than understanding. I’m just removing my adolescence, and forming myself with the real intent that I have, which as I see it, is the most worldly and enrichening when it is ripe with learning and teaching where I really care, and extending that humanity and strength to a future (and plausible) family.
            <br>&emsp;My wonderment is whether there is any real value and promise in furthering, or at the very least discussing and reveling (through these Windows 10 ways) fundamental physics, the Gods, death and our overall lives.Or how much money is worth it to never play Ark, or ultimate frisbee, to always see the compliments and attention of others over the integrity of your days? Is your own personal responsibility not filling, and occupying for that matter, and when you are so is the idea and or dream of flying, driving, appearances and dinners sincerely appealing? They are not for me. And the alternative that I am staked in is not merely an adjacent trajectory, ‘as if we went from lawyering to doctoring’. The aim is different, the course is different, the words are different. And instead of leaving off with, ‘and that difference is that I wish to and mean to progress for the sake of well-being and living, as compared to being well off’, I’ll offer a stronger quote instead. From what place and whom, no matter, only, it is (and here it goes), “I care less for books but what gives them value, those being the doctrines which fill them: as the best ones make a great book so.”

            As we once said, there is a hill atop the tree. Its claim, is the room and hand to see the lands around, and my favorite cloud above. So too, does its pleasentries make the demands around hospitable: for she is what their providing. Furthermore, is there land aorund this hill. On one end theres a grove, gentle and kind yet firm and stout, then theres a patch of woodlands scurting about, and some glades strung here and there. In some of the denser sections there are farms, where the trees are quite hollow, yet still bound. Pastures come and go, as do orchards and glens, but to each all is there trunks and canopies to be found, which makes my view from top nice and sound.
            <br>&emsp;I’ve begun to notice though that as our spot becomes secure and blossomed, so does the patch of land around thrive and glissen. The grass is greener, as our the bees making more honey. And as I see it, a bit of landscaping could make room for other members of the forest, or at least encourage those under their far off trunks, to come visit this heavenly garden. Still, the fruits are really what become our labor, and despite our growing intent and efforts to level out the field around, so does our higher makings draw our hand. Such illustrations and scripture truly define me in all that its worth. I see the sun setting, as well as the moon coming behind, and the pleasing sight of birds chirping around, makes not but the abscence of bombs and mowing a breeze. This tree of mine is all I have, and for no reason other, that we have become bare from our low needs, does its own grasp and wonder, give me all I seek.
            <br>&emsp;And so I am fine to resist the urge to join a farm, or to forgo the anticpation of starting something similar; were not going out there, we’re growing right here. To one side, we have the furthering green I can offer, and our trimmings and design serve merely as invitations -of which the birds and bees are already singing. On the other hand, is our shine, the real light which pillars from below, springing out of that upper trunk into the world above; here is where our energy and time is purely spent, as if there were rock sculptures marked in the otherwise meadowy grove.

        <div id="themanor">
            For some time Gillen sat alone, though without any shortness of peace. His life was far from normal, but in other ways par for the deepest norms. You see, Gill was no son of man, rather he was man himself. Astute, kind, wicked and rational. Never set to anything but himself, he smiled as he bowed to those around, and elected to endure without any semblance of duty. “As one who eats chocolate fears not or asks not why such thing is so enticing, so too did Gillen advance and contain a ready woe of cheer and respect for others and himself.”
            <br>&emsp;Now, such sweetness was not of a kind that others find in more common matters; rather, he simply found it satiable, like a warm afternoon. Hereby, his many interests and ventures were set not to feed his impulse or loins, but his character instead. In fact, as he’d say, it was the regularity of contentment and experience which he sought, and nothing more than those necessary things -or those which were deemed applicable- bent in any desired way.
            <br>&emsp;Gillen was raised to be a man, but grew up resenting the fact that his tasks (and according disposition) were really that of a boy. He knew so much about little, yet of alot he grew no lasting end. Even in his later years where more genuine pursuits sparked his mind, so too did he still resemble one ployed by a thoughtless end. As it were, he accepted the terms given to him, ‘even though the advice given and satisfaction by others on hand, did not match the apparent flatness to the cake(so to speak)’. From the start of 10 he began to ignore such recipes, finding more youth in the fresher foods (and fruits) instead. But when he entered youth a call for arms in kitchenhood was demanded, and despite his tender pallet, he had no skill and thus means of placement.
            <br>&emsp;The key difference of Gillen though was that he did not permit the tradition, even upon his own apparent lacking. Instead, he fostered his own recipes, leaning towards areas which were simple and effective. And even though for many years into his adolescence he had no home beyond the borders of defeat, he was happy. Despite his lack of suiters and good, his pallet and mind commendably and sincerely enjoyed even the minorest of things. Consequently, he sought not for anything more than to be so freshly satiated, and secure by his consistence.
            <br>&emsp;Time would go on though and the bareness of this line -however ample and pleasing- whithered away his core content. That trait though -or principle as it became through deliberation- of pure aims of goodness, rung him forward into an even heartier version of his centered self. Whereas before he was happy with nothing, so he gave that some extension. Effectively, Gillen enjoyed the fruits of his rightful life, as the relief and vanity of those otherwise traditions brought him nothing but ignorant pleasure or shame. Born from his frugal credulity, he relished great people and literature, the orbit of high entertinatmet around gaming and film, or the base act of traveling the lands outside his door. “Urban walks he’d call them, and treks.” By our mentioned though, these goods ran in conflict with the needs of the world. As we said, Gillen began to falter a little in how insubstantial his life had become. Even though those goods were plentiful and pure, their place began to shorten under his shrinking home.
            <br>&emsp;Better said, the world remained demanding of him, whereby his response was to be frugal; and as such, his response was only small, but sufficient. Unfortunately, this did not give any room for those genuine pleasures, and the still present need of duty (however small) persisted in rubbing against such preferred efforts. But, that amendment to goodness availed, as this squeezing of ease and peace into a small bottle drove an expansion of its bounds. The story goes that Gillen gave those interests of his more definition, and as he called it, ‘an objective aim’. In doing so these actions of his sincere kind, solidified as the fruits of his being, but also as the reasons for being elsewhere obliged. The minor tasks at hand were then given more justification for partaking in, making the smaller life more acceptable; and better yet, more rewarding, as the comparably simple things (yet of a robustness which reflected the root of his heart) furnished his time and care around, widening his experience to a favorable effect. Before, his time was spent being punctual and prudent, whereas now his labors were serving his cultivation and interest of writing and art. Moreso, the attention which he gave to those efforts, quickly turned itself to the actual work at hand (of provision that is). And by that, those toils became not so, and more utilized too. By his own remarks, “It was easy to show up from time to time for the little I needed, for the whole lot that I had.”

            Reading about great men (or women) brings me to a relatable sense of cheer. Foremost, is that I see how their life emulates my own, in that we are each human. Consequently, the world around seems more hospitable and ill bravoes. What I mean to avoid is this sense that people are foolishly lauding their achievements over my head. When I read about great men however, I sit back into the view that neither are people feeling too rewarded, but they are not seeing themselves as great or better (comparatively). Moreover, is it clear that our centrality is not so unknown, and that by seeing how so and so lived their life, so too does their world around seem equally busy, but passing by: and in return of these studies, so does our world appear the same.
            <br>&emsp;Now, different folks offer different strokes, be it from their innovations or their candor, or to their solitude or creative resolve. The ancients speak to this foremost, for they not only share great insights via their writings, but you also see how level the world their part of is, for them and all around. Mathematicians and Scientists offer their own esoteric reward, whereby advancements of mechanical thinking and study are reached through ending amounts of lasting privation. Reading about Newton then or Galileo, brings me to a sensible place of the people around, as well as valuing our own committed developments. Writers and Artists too share this effect, but add a further point of industry and methods; or in other words, they speak to how great things are done, and how the life which accompanies this is truly a higher one. And better said, we can describe that better life as one which is similar in structure and layout, while flowering more into a prominent state. “As if a colorful version of the same model.”
            <br>&emsp;On top of that, it is worth remembering that this model we share is in many ways identical, as in the case for the conditions of life, as well as being simply comparable on the basis of what peace and enjoyment require, and what fairs risk for familial and personal fortune. “Most things slip easily for the serf and his king; and not but the jail of hell could invite varying pleasures from a sunset, or the briefest amount of self respect.”
            <br>&emsp;These are in short the heart of our community, for through it we see the pleasing nature of the world around, while also bringing more central firmness and strength by more strictly knowing. The modern world has its own angle though, as it is by definition that point whereby the chore is in learning how to live. Assessing Marlyn Monroe or George Lucas, bears fruits of what this requires. Better said, it is nice to hear about people in these open days, who do great things, but are still themselves ordinary. And by seeing this we can realize that such free lanes are not the harbingers of necessity for you to achieve glory and posterity. Instead, we can see that a broader approach of dense riches, fairs best in the lands where anything goes. And in a way, this modern take is one where people who are not so great and do great things, sheds off the mistake of seeing them as great, or that your ends should be equally rewarding. This liberty of ours is to live well after all, and coming from the bottom we can see that the principle best is when we are ourselves. And that instead of seeing the road ahead as an open lane for conquest, let us simply be who we are in the truest way, then further in its width through a natural gait, or gradual process rather as remarks our interests solidifying below.

            The form is quite important in anything you do. An age old question was about why you should write properly in your journaling, seeing as they were private. Well, the answer is simple. If I wish to speak about our childhood, that is our material. And that I would choose to do it in prose is more or less the style. That we would spell correctly, and insert paragraphs, reflects the form. And the reason we administer the latter is that it further helms the former. Now, expression is as expression does, and some may simply wish to fling paint at the wall; only they have merely lived in that moment, leaving very little that is recognizable behind. Whereas in our private writings, we can formulate them well enough that the work done bears more lasting significance, which in fact (as I’ve found) purports further additions, or adjustments at least.
            <br>&emsp;Another example is that if you enjoy the sunset, you may wish to inscribe your view of it beyond the outer feelings of it being bright and warm. Instead, you may earn more and feel higher by constructing your view of it with more shape, grades of hue and vibrance, context of what’s around; and as a consequence, a simple regard -be it in words or illustration- may instill the care you have for the subject, and motivate you to expand your sight of it, in more elusive ways in many cases. In that, we learn to study the sun and its way, or make further reflections of our previous views, or at least further describe the current ones we have; moreso, might we relate ourselves and the other elements of our lives, both in terms of how this subject compares to those, and how this as a particular element speaks to the mold by which it and those others follow. “Being more attentive to the operation by which you express yourself, furthers the well of values you have, as well as their members.”
            <br>&emsp;For me personally then, increasingly being myself needs specific regards for particular pieces of the form, as well as the way the mediums relate. Moreso, could we differentiate what is preferable for each, and that which marks our love. “For on Twitter we are asked to compose threads, order them and head the lot with a table of contents, but our work that fills the margins is built and delivered from another hand -of our heart let’s say.” In that way, we can generalize and say that the goal of our lives is to forever and further be ourselves; and if doing so amounts to bringing your mind and care to fruition, then the deliberation and design that reflects this suggests a large and expanding path; and as such, deserves (and in many ways demands) our steps be towards an advance that respects the frame of this lane. And if such bearing is more akin to war and travel as compared to a battle or (brief) excursion, then we can comfortably say that we are prior to the thrusts of such expressive experience.
            <br>&emsp;In being pre-mature, yet rightly at the beginnings of a true line, we can address ourselves now as proceeding from the start of our lives. This isn’t to say that we aren’t already moving, only that our consistency need oblige the frame in which the term is set -that being forever, and increasing to. By that token, ought our battlements and strategy respect the fact that we are in the early stages of matured production, and with reference to what we explained before (regarding forms and substance), we can for now just focus on material, while we otherwise study and prepare how they will be administered -or baked rather. Those are conditional regards though, meaning that they act as a standard that can be met and surpassed. While our interest in literature for example, marks the coals and embers of being me, and thus will remain.

            I had this novel idea that the reason we socialize is that it gives us the room to express ourselves in a larger way, and that this is by virtue of our instruments being otherwise alarmed at the presence of others who seem unfriendly. A private congregation speaks to this, in that they both feel condemned and ill expressed outside their group. On their own however, they seem hollow, or at the very least seem unformidable beyond the group assurance within.
            <br>&emsp;All ends are for peace, as this means you are doing things well, in both your response and vision. Now, wisdom and character reveal the world in what it truly is; and primarily, reflects our deaths and baser needs, while also tempering riled up ones that come from our ignorance of this.
            <br>&emsp;Are we not free then? What are we defending against, besides our honest reflections? I am not sure. Partially, it is because the world’s opened up and overwhelms us with intrusive impressions. The statement of this is important. If we were not distressed, then we would be free, and act within an according spirit. Were always poked though, and moreover do we childishly ignore the fact that our impressions are ill founded. “It’s as if the teachers in school reference the fact that the world is as the news says, and then alludes to us as though we are trying to figure things out amidst it. Their teachers for gosh sake, yet it seems like they’re just making conversation. Only their image is more complete yet less founded, whereas ours is smaller, but in a way sprouting towards the same ignorance.”
            <br>&emsp;And when we think the world is here -by the view born from all those blurbs coming together to press upon us- we prescribe ourselves to its medium. This leads to avarice, whereby we ignore people’s personal agency, and assume otherwise that a water hole will attract a bunch; piracy too comes up as we then scurry over opportune gains.
            <br>&emsp;There’s just so much hustle and bustle, and I am convinced that it is from a culture that imitates the more rooted lineage, which is born from the grand average of people giving things very little thought. In Christian times, you could sensibly revere the will of Christ. Moreso was there an end clearly laid. In modern times still there is nothing but death, yet we still act as though things are required by which our amendment to what’s trending and laborous is demanded. No one has ever been exempt from living frugally, nor being considerate.
            <br>&emsp;The heart of the wound is in sight. A bully in school, or kids who are mean make fun of others, who then respond with submission, either in passive preservation, or bulking up. These kids though hear it from their parents, who hear from the news, who as an aggregator relies on the grouping of particular segments into the whole.
            <br>&emsp;What is happening is that people are afraid. Principally, I think this is so by virtue of your place if you are out of agreement. The explanation could go as follows then. Everyone is subject to the lands around. And as it is, we’re all foolishly in agreement about the state of our culture and the world. However, and the point, is that being more clear and sensible brings you out of that line. Because if you say that there is no grave presence of racism, or that a career is futile, or that children should be properly raised, to those who otherwise ignore this or have elsewhere been filled with hot air, these rational remarks come across as either impositions or unrealistic. “Wake up Ryan, haven’t you seen the news, the worlds gone to hell.” It’s as if they cant hear anything past the register of their immediate response.
            <br>&emsp;This is all a simple compound effect. Not in severity mind you, only in substance. Where the truth lies though is in the everyday nature and course of our lives. And the strands of the world reported on are dirty and red, but they don’t in fact spread across the entire garment, where those primary concerns are held -and thus acted upon. That is why being frugal and free, rational, reserved and cheerful is uninteresting to people, or even offensive. For in their mind the troubles are larger, political, international, prepping for hate, and acting otherwise runs contrary to such threats, or at the very least addresses them poorly. “How do you have time for fun and respect, there’s a battle going on!”
            <br>&emsp;You might say the crux of this is how people respond to danger compared to those who are at peace, and how we are hindered by falsities of the former, and failing to cultivate the necessary fruits and more prominent gains of the latter. And in terms of us, the question then is who we should be if we fall towards that proper end.

            For some reason the world feels afar, and partially this is from our lack of place locally. But a larger issue has accrued, and that is the fact that our gradual debts of viewing things improperly, have shackled their inappropriate conclusions as if they were true. Now, all seems to be going on around, and even if we are in a stable state, so to do we peer out the door; better yet do we announce the merit of our efforts and their readiness to be placed outside.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, we are premature. And as it happens we are not in a retreat away from those who would otherwise pass judgment. And although that course has left us with holes, or preconceptions at least, so too have we advanced beyond any downward trajectory. This has come from sharing our interests and creations, and alluding to either their promise or continuation in the days ahead. Consequently, our aspirations are in no holding order, ‘as if we are being asked when they will be gotten around to’. Still, that knife hovers lightly overhead, however blunted.
            <br>&emsp;The truth, is that those dreams and ambitions have grown right inside of me, and our adventurous course of grandeur and notoriety feels somewhat necessary and appealing. Reflecting on the world as it really is though -or on the contrary I mean- and identifying the elements which truly are important to me, tidies me up and keeps me tender and light, whereby foolish promises or perceived expectations slide on by. In a word, people’s enthusiasm over me doing something rubs me the wrong way, as their suggestion is that such course would be good, whereby I lose myself in fear and doubt over the shortened end I otherwise seek. But, it is that underdeveloped truth which holds little aim or regard, and makes such comments penetrating, as if I were being either criticized or pitied -morose do I feel small, like the latter.
            <br>&emsp;The question then is one of honesty, as we naturally will do what we are right to. And even though reflection and deliberation are required, so too does our firm state bring this out pleasingly, and effortlessly. And accordingly, do our efforts follow; or at the very least, will our ingrained nature to be doing something, heed the light which we have placed ahead. None see this as contrary, but they do want me to be doing. And such worthwhile ends are not so simple to acquire when our writing hands or reading eyes are dull. And so, we spend time just trying to live, worried that our apparent non-forwardness will draw concern. The grounds have solidified though and the limit is really in me. As it were, their recommendations aren’t wrong, and in turn of what is obvious in what could further me more, we can still try it. At least advancing ourselves through that can be aspiring enough, that we can at least share that we attempted, then explain that its end or task ran contrary to where I was set upon. And if it is desirable through your heart and bone, then go for it. But resting on the common fact that all ends are equal, and that nothing from the fruit of our yearning loins comes easy, strictly warrants any obvious query. For we are not in that way going out of our own. And we can at least say that we tried, reassuringly, and proceed if the ease is in fact more present, or happily stay for the sake of our own private matters. “The struggle comes from a consequent place that frazzles us over proceeding besides this, and otherwise settling in because the core of it lacks reinforcement -by clarity mind you as opposed to proof and scrutiny.”

        <div id="adearclaim">
            The world could surely just end, or otherwise change into something which it hasn’t been. What is identifiable may not be known, but it is safe to say that what is relevant is that which is identifiable. We may in fact be limited in our ability to do so, but that should merely humble us, or if we at the very least haven’t used our tools of perfection on everything, then so too should we accordingly proceed. I say this with the utmost confidence, for just as I realize that I need food to eat and air to breath, or the simple (yet deeper) reflection that rest is more desirable than moments of fun (and lack of following rest), so too can I see that our death is merely peaceful. Nothing except the broadest of concepts could tell me how my soul would be following death, and testimony fairs little here -as it ultimately counts on what we can identify- and seeing as there are no contrary elements that suggest our lack of being would not in fact be just that (lacking), leads me to believe this is true, and accordingly oblige to it by virtue of there being (necessarily) an amendment. “For all wisdom points to a path, truth being the measure for which way is best to go; but in all ends, or routes that is, having one is the crucial given. For we may otherwise be undecided and fretful, which brings no lasting claim.”
            <br>&emsp;Adding to that, I can say that in writing this, and by taking refuge in what’s identifiable -and thus negating all things which run contrary to what could occur based on what has been identified- I see that this definite end is not a poor one. As it were, in my own strides of life, I sleep; moreover, do I upon series of actions rest. And in that latter especially do I find the deepest satisfaction and state, ‘as my body feels out of itself when it remains a servant to further action, as if the prior one’s completed were not sufficient’. Rest just feels good, as it reflects work done well. And in any case, again with the notion that nothing is the predicament, fears me not, as on one end there is no subjection to fear and scrutiny, while the other side sees such a time as (consequently, and inherently) peaceful. Perhaps the Buddhist notion of one’s struggle coming from ignorance, affords me (or at least has) the freedom to see such time as splendid, as upon my own awareness and self regard, has living truly been claimed, and thus given rest its reputable position. “As I say, my body needs action, both in terms of obligation, but also in terms of the ‘itching’ that comes from that disposition -in the case where such priors were fulfilled, yet I sought to continue.” And in that case, my mind and spirit settle nicely, either in a purely resting state -whereby ‘nothing’ (akin to the activity of meditation) is done- or through simpler and tender moments -wherein the centered states of my mind and body settle into lighter things, in an equal fashion.
            <br>&emsp;Ignorance has removed this, for just as I can identify that death is our gain -and its identifiable nature- so too can I and have, recognized the particular motions, or states rather, which I’d qualify as either positive or negative. In other words, by giving my self a great deal of lasting thought and care, I have seen what is preferable, reflected on and deliberated their cause, then forwardly assessed and considered -almost by virtue of my ease- to such a tranquil end. “It’s as if in our orderly and centered state, a natural and destined end of pure nothingness, seems pleasing, and otherwise explicitly graspable by being rational (or principled rather).”
        </div>

        <div id="thefullestway">
            It is believed more or less that demonstrating yourself in the fullest way is the right way to be. And to any prompt as ‘what about the world’, this we’ll say covers it. “For in being myself I bring the most; moreover, we could say that the end of all things about the land, is that those present could be themselves too.”
            <br>&emsp;By that token, I call on the premise of progress, that is if developments are said to be made, then the end in which they seek will come about too -the common example being health brought on by the exercises that you do, and as the latter improves than so too should the former, otherwise the mean is off.
            <br>&emsp;Furthermore, we can say what being ourselves amounts to. As a common mold, our death brings us a limit, where we would otherwise reach who we are in the fullest and remain. As there is an end in accordance with the limits of tissue, then so too will our active time as our fullest selves wain. “For even if the mold remains, our use of it will not; this is the case ultimately, but also as we approach that point -so a lessening will also occur alongside the final end.” In any case, the point is that in being ourselves in the truest way, will that time wain, whereby we are (more or less) set to retire. “As if the water is calming, despite being pure.”
            <br>&emsp;Now, actions prior to this will be explicitly incomplete, seeing as they come from a less than ideal instrument. The crucial point is that just as one in their beginning years progresses to a point of even standards, so too will the person at that competent stage work from a place of initial goodness -or well placed steps- to great ones. At least, that our steps from a complete base will be relatively lesser than those which follow is what were trying to say. Only, just as a chef with a blunt knife cuts better after subsequent tries, even a sharp knife will see better cuts ahead, although the early ones are still alright.
            <br>&emsp;In other words, the path to greatness, or the realization of our truest self, begins when the right steps are taken: and these are definitively true, and correspondingly rewarding. It’s just the case that as more are taken, will the goodness flower and blossom. “Whereas the time and effort before this stage, however abundant and set, fairs substance of a lesser measure -or quality that is.” For the sake of argument then, we’ll clarify that many subpar steps are lesser than the early days of ones well founded. A simple explanation is that only so many steps are taken in each case, per interval that is; so we aren’t talking about one hundred 9/10s compared to four 10s, rather a couple of bullseyes over a few more slight shorts, sees the former as stronger.
            <br>&emsp;Another element of this then, is how those founded steps proceed. Simply, we can define the range of it by those prior definitions, that upon maturing, or fully fitting into our shoes that is, can we take proper steps, and that the trajectory from there takes you from, as they say, a young adult to a full one -whereupon you retire. In other words, our end, actively that is, or of our self regard, is in taking our greatest step. And just as we addressed death as a common issue, so too will we bring up the occurrence of relationships and children. That is due to these segments of our lives being the most important, more or less. If you are a champion, a tyrant, a saint or even a god, it is usually your connection to those around which best describes the blossoming success of your day. “That is, if you were well, it was in the midst of that, rather than being without, yet somehow fully set within the presence of accolades and coin.”
            <br>&emsp;Again, we are trying to take the strongest step; and if we consider how relations effectively amount to separate agencies (or members) coming together (to relate), then we can most definitely say that such bond is purest and true when the parties involved are whole themselves. “Two great thieves form a band of deceipt, but at least a full one, compared to two bumbling fools who barely join to make a half, or two amateur saints otherwise.”
            <br>&emsp;That being said, we can illustrate this further by distinguishing between relations you have, or get rather, and those that you give. As a sunset is gracious, as we are hospitable and respectful, so too would a partner or friend earn your love and accord. But in comparison to the other obvious aspect of children, we could say that the clear difference between the two is that one emphasizes what you get, in comradery and intimacy let’s say, while the other banks itself moreso towards what you give. To be clear neither are exclusively the other, but to my friend Bob who lends an ear, despite how much of mine I give to him, so too to my son Bobby, will the loan be better: and moreso will I ask for less, as in this case my place is of a role foremost, compared to the latter which roots itself in mutual benefit. “And such an exchange is lacking, in weight that is, when it comes to me and my child -as I only seek to give while charging little.”
            <br>&emsp;In effect then, besides the particular needs by each kind of relation, we can forwardly say that where the best one is in place, is where we are appropriately the best member ourselves. “At the very least we can say that our duty and limit of inclusion, is in being a full half.” Based on the law of attraction though, or at least how these sort of bonds form, becoming yourself prior seems necessary. That is, upon maturing and filling out from there, can people suited to respond to that fall in line. Whereas if we are immature, then the relations we have will be necessarily incomplete, both by virtue of us not bringing who we fully are to the table, as well as those others who, if being complete (so to speak) themselves, will not be pairing with one who is truly set for them. “Ill founded steps sees everyone lose: which is why being ourselves in the truest way bonds us properly with the world, and in turn we gain.” And more or less, the sentiment of what’s appropriate follows with children, whereby the need they have to be nourished and raised, will only be so fully if what you have to offer is equally so.

            The two sides of our life, at least in regards to what were concerned with, is the leveled truth of our course, and our otherwise resolve to treat it. Simply, the former is capped by our coming death, as are the stakes of others; too, we are a prince of such fortunes, for when my Dad passes away (and my mom too), we will inherit their wealth. “As I have done so mentally through the spoils of Descartes and Socrates.”
            <br>&emsp;A midpoint reflects our ambition, and how life will generally remain local and tame, and if it otherwise springs up into more adventure and fun, then the requirements to do so will themselves remain, while also being the prominent feature of our lives. “Which is why they say you never work a day if you do what you love, for those on business live very little.”
            <br>&emsp;In terms of our resolve it amounts to three things. On the front end is said business, which is to say something which is manufactured for the public eye; personally, though I prefer to angle this sight through the lens of operation, whereby we simply adhere and respect that such efforts are only relevant, of interest or rewarding if we are constant and substantial. On the other end sits our local affairs, whereby excitement and returns are given little regard, and we instead lay each brick for the sake of our joy and rest. This is not a route for fortune while were in it, and although it springs fruits for that former application, our mind is merely advancing through what it can bring right now; whereas that prior side looks to expand itself by virtue of these efforts, and afterward rest in the room on hand, our enriched life of presence and immediacy merely looks to contribute in ways that it is pleasing now. The former side looks for solidarity, learning and teaching through community, while seeing more ahead with pride and confidence; though it must also fend with the weights of a slow pace. This personal side seeks to be with the world immediately, or at least go right to the end by which those fortuned offerings would provide. Here, we are home through ourselves, and with friends and family by virtue of humanity. We are saturated by history and science, while giving our own time and color to the writings of others, or the bare beauty of great games and film. This lane of ours is always on the edge of expanding infinitely wide, yet strictly sharpened -and thus short in the point in front- or is otherwise brought back to a place where nothing is cared for but our return, either in fortune or of that known grip.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, this is our primary life, as we are with ourselves regardless. Breathing though is hard, as is being on your own with stillness; and so venturing forth to find more lands or significance bears nothing sparse, but is a venture no less. And whereas the trek of our local hearts is in our craft and ability to paint with the minor strands of our soul, so too is that outer pursuit one of industry and might, wherein the grandeur which appears on offer is appealing. For each though, it is our advance, through ourselves or towards such might; for either, no end is but ours truly in sight.
            <br>&emsp;And quickly, there is a halfway between the two which we call direct initiative, whereby we apply ourselves intuitively and sensibly in ways that our natural arrangments have; submitting our essays is a primary example as is taking co-opeative (or at least involved) classes or workshops. These are not meant to bring you through the world, but merely extend who you are on your own. And as they say, friendship is found between those of similar care and interest, and so being yourself around others can afford such opportunity to see and attract: only though, so that you are more at home.

        <div id="constantbend">
            I fear not to fail in this description, but the subject offers most with any definition. Simply, as our condition is present, so is a humble response of dear fertility. Practically, the reasoning for our post is one thing, but the attention onto its treatment by us, is comparable to a deference to drunkenness, ‘whose bleeding eyes leave nothing pretty to remark upon’. As one may become averse to that, so would the crumbiness of our obligations spark a similar response.
            <br>&emsp;Now, the distinction is not that the cause of these effects would be shoved aside, for they are our condition. Instead, ought we treat them like athletics, whereby our failure to warmup and its consequent effect of stiffness, would not be a fault of the game but your oblige. So too with work and other roles, that if your arguing with your family, it is not their fault, nor the world’s malice for setting you upon such despair, but your own failure to listen.
            <br>&emsp;There is to be clear an element to this which remedies and dissipates the weight and or sharpness of these points of demand, but these are more like elevations by virtue of your own higher point, wherein the range of your front and back increases. In that way, your alignment to the effects of your role condition you well if your response is born of non bitterness and despair. That is, if your job has you bundled in shades, then stretch, or be more centered on the reasoning for doing it as to draw its purpose out; for if you otherwise complain and pout about it’s sorrowful declaration, then so will you remain and fail to profitably amend.
            <br>&emsp;This is why the main question is to whether or not we should respect or defer our response. If it were the ramblings of men or the shrillness from being drunk, then our actions could be directed elsewhere. But if it is our basic oblige to seed food and bed, then regardless of the instance which procures this, so is the demand embedded.
            <br>&emsp;The vector for this inquiry then is how and why such a scenario should be treated through an obvious way? One evident fact is that within a given condition, amending to it fairs more that shrugging it off. And so we may wish to and own the belief that our civil struggles can be removed, but to our death and common lives, will the presence of ignorance there sprout comparable burdens. Moreover, we must remember that even if all duties were in retreat, that a deep breath and or the absence of gluttonies effect would still persist. By that token, our free time may be dreamt of as that which holds us behind no bars, but only in that is the dragging weight removed, while the scrumptious joy of our heartful expression stays flat -by this point at least. That front end seems to remain as long as we have bodies, for rest is otherwise acquired, while the risk of idleness lingers. In that, a condition seems constant, ‘for in the meagerest of ways, we attribute frailty to a whithering king, or even the God of boredom’.
            <br>&emsp;What we can take from this, with the whole of things in mind -for even thieves garner an initial reward- is that a need to deliberate and reflect will persist, be it in times of war or those of freedom. The basis of this discussion then, is that a retreat from the former does not bring you away from a similar response required in the latter, only that in this latter the task is to express your liberality -as opposed to bracing yourself against the deeds of that other’s harshness. And I would say that regardless of which circumstance were in, that our amendment is still required. You could imagine that the absence of war is preferable to those lands of idle freedom, but neither is exempt from a response: the one being of clear necessity, and the other as to remove the whithering implosion.
            <br>&emsp;Through this case, we ought to avoid dreaming of a time outside the war that would cease all requests from us: for this wish is false. We may wish for the simple removal of the chains around us, but the limit of yearning then comes into play, ‘for where will action then go, to which our ignorance of that seems ill founded’.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, the presence of duty has spurred a proper response in me, to which the weight of it has been increasingly leveled, and provisional to our gracious freedom and our broader action. That this form of amendment is strong has been established -as pittering around the presence of misfortune and deeds is in contrast to virtue. But I can say with a reputable honesty, is that this line of progress doesn’t merely turn off the beaten path and onto an even road, but continues by the sentiment of freedom’s requirements -and those lingering baser commands. What prevails then, is that vicious notion, as if our ingenuity ought be applied to removing the condition, or finding ways to add more torque to the rope. Of avarice this is poor, but in demonstrating creativity it is not, but losing sight of your path on the whole reflects a scurrying restlessness, as opposed to more hand crafted re-alignments -and even longer lasting alterations of our bearing.
            <br>&emsp;To reiterate, the heart of this discussion stems from that greediest of questions regarding the control of our fortune. As it were, the place of one accordingly but in the nearest of spaces (by those torments) has not much else to go on; for in a way their head is so covered, and likely by their own action, that nothing good or of reason has previously developed. “And so the dreams of removing these grievances is understandable.” In our case though, the ground has begun to tilt downwards, and our pull from the shine beyond slowly increases. Admittedly there is no regard for what happens or what were missing as this process goes on, yet right behind me is a point where such curiosity was spent for the sake of fortune’s credit. The design of this is important, but I think I can firmly conclude, that all the peeking and or wonderment of what could otherwise be -and in many cases, considering the goods I’d generated, where it would be advantageous and pleasing to go- simply sprouts from our own weeds of which those far below have but more of the kind. Even those saints who are ignorant of death and subject to the woes of it, earn little perfection in their warranted respect, ‘for a fool otherwise who is treated inhumanely, still forgoes the identical asset of the wholest of regards’. “Which in many ways exposes one to even the minorest of threats, and gives them no personal defense against things of a comparably higher significance.” Thus, such people are not exempt from their ignorance, that is their receipt of credit. For in our case, so is an absence of death’s regard, or that of our family, or our life in general and the persisting need to water it well, affords me no principle difference in being weighed down in the samest of ways. Those in war or those drenched in poverty, do have more weight on their shoulders, but so for us as for them is it not the mark of damage being done, but the suiter being dealt to, the man, who (to my point) be it under grievous subjection, or the mere awareness of a strand of ours whithering away, earns no acclaim or repose to such troubles, ‘without cultivating knowledge and formative regard’.
            <div class="qu">To which not even the horrors of misery can offend. “For death has no greetings for those outside her door.” Bring me to that then</div>

            So considering aims, tradition has its stake. There’s a root of thoughtlessness though, as it pays little attention to how we’ll actually live. At any rate, we could define the elements of our aim.

Partner wise, it would be odd if they were in contrast to myself; they need not avoid a bed, but if their aims were outside of how we actually spend our time, then the costs accounted for that are in fact outside of any relations happening. As far as I am aware, our all could be given now (alongside another), and our smaller living would be fine. To be clear, parks and technology furnish us the most, while dining rooms are explicitly unnecessary, as is a living room further than a bed. More than that, there is little social availability that is common outside school. And I won’t belittle them, but I support nothing about the current educational (and its logistic) paradigm. I recognize though that it fills a necessary hole, that being teaching and comradery, but its execution feels either negative or average. I don’t mind though resting our choice as if that were a condition, equal to our own demands of bringing generosity forth.
            <br>&emsp;Then, when it comes to travel, our home, our occupations or even our friends, I care only for living. That means that the idea of something holds very little stock in me, nor do I need garnishes or elaborations to simply watch TV. And in fact, watching television or any activity of the sort, actually benefits from all the activity around, be it formative or recreational. And so where there are parks, your family, distance to work and stores etc., these mark the grooves to fit, as they actually alter the pace of life. Besides that, a friendship is all I need, as living well is enough for me, as it is fortuned enough to have a country, region, family and stead. Breathing life into that is our limit though, and although our aim is not to exhaust its reach beyond our bounds, so too can it be evened out and strengthened, and better acted on too. That is the place for our friend.
            <br>&emsp;Realistically, adoption is no false measure, nor is surrogacy or one’s overall health a hasty limit on our particular chance to have a child. I am sure it will always be possible; or if it isn’t, then so too will we be generous elsewhere. Generationally, it is books and culture which translate your impact. “Less War and Peace carried less than Tolstoy’s children.” So the duty is sparse. Regarding our fulfillment, it is no good place to own a home and have a mortgage, but fail to make the payments and eventually lose the house. For one, it did not offer anything more when it came to living. Its fortune may give room elsewhere, but for the most part it is not effectively so. Having children is no different, that unless you are willing and able to raise them well, then there is no cause. This means that a social setting (and no infraction to demands) is in place beyond the current school system, for one. And two, that if you are able then you are willing and set for that to be your course. Again, this is not something you just get to do, for it is neither a two nor a responsibility. It is for us to be generous and live, yet our occupation with it must be right rather than novel. Foolish choices then are not acceptable, nor is the refinement until that fulfillment short of things you can personally do. Better yet, with the assumption that you would have a kid with another, would that in its own right account for something to give. And if it lasted, perhaps we could say it is duly so if the family ahead was pursued with the shared notion of what that was properly for.
            <br>&emsp;And to me, these are the boundless fruits of our blossoming. And although presidency’s, operations, singing and cleverness bolster these fronts from behind, I otherwise see our own need and demand, as being a man, for those true and rightful ends will properly come from me being myself, sincerely and true.

        <div id="lifeofintellect">
            A life of intellect is simply one which grows from actions of the purest kind. This isn’t to say they are constantly well ordered, or mannered mind you, but rather that the vector for development is one of the dearest sort: of which man’s is his intellect. In practice, this means that our words and ideas paint the world; or better said, that those which do, for we are all intelligent as it is, are the greatest they can be. One must regard though that this path is merely one of the ripest substance, as opposed to being beyond any other kinds within the class of paths. Again, our reach is through intelligence, but so musn’t we overestimate the worth in that when compared to other paths; for if a saw were the agent in mind, then so would a course which granted the highest activity of that be one of greatness; and rather than supposing that our intelligent nature holds expressions which are superior than those of a carpenters tool, let us sprout from the way our particular operation is conducted. Better said, we may hold our sort of path as one of increased diligence; but these roots are at most complex grooves in which we are meant to fit. For it is true by nature’s causes, that our composition and award of intelligence is merely grander and deliberate, but not more significant: or rather, it, as a form, is equally so as all others, and thus deserves as fair treatment as the rest.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, our use of intelligence will sprout fruits which reflect our dearest activity; and such counts are of the utmost when compared to the nature and expressions of all other things: but we are only the more rewarded for being so. This is in contrast to being somewhat unintelligent, or imperfect rather, but presuming that our approach to being so is not just towards a complete use and accordingly higher reward, but one where the action itself is higher than we know, as if it were marked by some beacon of divine messaging and promise. Our natural way though, in which all objects are definitively signed, sees our rational use as nothing more than a more complicated expression than that of a rock’s stillness; only in that case, the perfection of it yields minor rewards, whereas we earn the sights and creativity of the entire world (while being fully intelligent)
            <br>&emsp;Culture in a way brings us beyond the mere presence of friends and comfort, for our path beyond primitive freedom is one of that intelligence. That is, instead of mending to nature for the sake of preservation, we build up to it, in that the former is aimed at securing the space around you, while the latter brings you (through intelligent expression) onto the world around. In a practical sense, our dextrous industry once held the means to gather material and provisions, while in this point where our norms have soldified past the concerns for survival, those working hands can tribute the stars.
            <br>&emsp;What is strange though is that the more intelligent you get -that is, where that tribute is concerned- the less prevalent we are in the areas of security and comfort. Now, its not as if people are in danger or real struggle, but we do work alot, with ignorance mind you that it is indeed for things past true provision. But in either case, we are either huddled around the fire with relief from perishing, or were roasting winnies and babbling about as we go between shifts at work. Each is tributing the work though, or our provision rather: while that life of intelligence marks an experience which expands past a state of struggle or concern.
            <br>&emsp;Historically though, we are not in a place where that recognition (and according resolve) that we are in fact safe and free to tribute, is common, or sincere at least. And I find that as we come about in this fashion, that a mission comes about, whereby we revere the fact that we are set and stable, but in need of some guiding post to keep us accountable beyond the basic needs of survival. That is, instead of actually being free and tributing the world as you can, we turn our attention from survival towards rewards of a grander kind. The problem though, is that these stakes are merely set so that we can receive the fruits of a life lived well; but for one, their views on the reality of things is poor, and otherwise rooted in the fact that upon being secure, we may not know what to do.
            <br>&emsp;This is the liberal struggle. For without disposition or friendship, remaining steady and on course to that generous life is full of solitude and trouble; or otherwise, if we hold such ends as a mission, or rather some point which is bigger than ourselves -by virtue of us seeing what are in fact our true norms, but from a point of being lesser- we will make gluttunous and or restless mistakes, which keep us either vain as we root ourselves into unbecoming ways, or were unsatisifed, as the sights on those truer fashions become ruffled and unaccessible.

        <div id="theamericanscholar">
            The American Scholar is the delegated intellect for the modern world. In this case, he is in contrast to those who parrot other people’s words and ideas; these, are thinking men, in that whichever thoughts have already come to pass, they express. While our Man of thinking, is one who does so himself.
            <br>&emsp;The service that one within the office of intellect holds, is to cheer, to raise and to guide. His vector is rooted in what is original, as he plows the slow, unhonored and unpaid task of observation.”For in those, he has thought, and shares.” He must relinquish display and immediacy (in fame that is), for his cataloging is both lengthy and of the unknown. As Emerson says, ‘Flamsteed and Herschel may inscribe the bounty of stars, while those of the scholarly intellect bend themselves towards the chartering of the human mind, tracking that which no man has yet thought’. Moreover, he may patiently watch for days, sometimes months, just for a few facts -adjusting old ones as he goes. In this, he must sometimes accept poverty and solitude, disdain by those ignorant and able, or the mere stammering of his speech -for he is still figuring things out, as opposed to the solidified performances of old. In a word, he must take in the shiftless aspects of his approach, whereby he bends his will to new facts, especially those which over time reveal themselves to be true in a fundamental sense, whereby even the most common of truths are in need of a remolding.
            <br>&emsp;Our age is retrospective it seems, for in a way, what is known is really that which comes from the bottom, while the drawing light in front has already been decided. That is, the experience of those of times far old, angles our own view today. And this is what we write about. Only Emerson suggests otherwise, and Thoreua in an explicit yet private sense. Not to digress, but we may concur that this happens due to a lack of societal concern for growing such ends. That is, if the light ahead which remarks the scenery of old, is either taken now in private, or is forgone as anything of interest at all, then how will there be any productive or communal end whereby the light (as it is) broadly grows? We’ve split the atom and seen the stars drifting above, yet that light, which we’ll say is a figure for purpose and aims, has not matched itself with the scales of the nature we now see. As we said, the truth in that is retrospective. But as I see it, the limit for it having a contemporary advance, is in the privation required to do so. That is what the American scholar is; someone who has a relation to the universe, a religion, ontology and epistemology which is original to themselves. Their views adhere to facts as opposed to tradition, for the latter warrants only what is in fact evident, making the custom uneccessary -for without it, so would its truth be known to those first at hand. And at any rate, where the ways of the world and ourselves are unknown, they ask and speculate, subjecting themselves to the lane of that one within the office of intellect. This person whose philosophy is of insight, does so at the expense of uncertainty and the faintness which comes from a loss of time. This self-accusation though is a mere bramble, for even though the sun can be clearly known and seen on the birth of each, so are those slender strands which only a lifetime could, required of one to see so. “And time can seem unclear and passing in such self relying and directed ways. Especially when their fashions always seem out of sort; and despite their own road to making a life of their own, so do the hostilities and contempt from others (by those educated especially) tear at their sides.”
            <br>&emsp;The way does become easier though, for the core idea here is that within life there is still something to know. We need not the conclusions of the Church and the Greeks, but inspiration and encouragement to go off and wander as they did, only in this brand new world. For in doing so against all odds, what the scholar can say is in fact ripe and wonderful, whereby the wider truth he sees merrits adoption by others, whose lives become more representative to nature and her fullest way. And as it were, that even if the cause of this is an original view from another, so is it in this case that such offer brings a stance to all which is rooted in both breadth and firmness, whereby others can stand newly (as if awoken), but then strive for themselves. “As if the trunk of life were rooted by those modernly divine, but only so all treated by it could then go and find their own branches, earning their own fruits in effect. Moreso, could they relish (or adhere at least) to the respect and care for the foundations at hand: which is to say that albeit given (and thus unoriginal initially) so can their young lives within this fuller time be one of personal treatment and regard, which is nothing short of their own.”
            <br>&emsp;This path, whether discovered or inherited, consoles the one taking its way. Whether in origin or inspired in a particular direction, were all scholars, as we are always learning; and by our own nature, are we stirdy enough to do this in the privation which it seeks, but also bright and happy to then share what we have found, whereby we breathe such thoughts into the public realm. “We are the world’s eye in that sense, for their heads are all down, while ours are lasting and up.” By that, our conclusions are not simply that of old, but of ours so far in the current time. Were adding, growing, branching out into the vast existence which science and its discoveries now deem. And again, whether we are the first, or are at some point a student, we are all reaching a point of illustriousness, whereby we paint the world as it now seems. “Our mind is colored not by what has been seen, but rather that which we are seeing. And all that such impressions pronounce, we hear and promulgate.”

            I feel solidarity brings value to my life. Farmers churn the soil, and I in turn pay them (indirectly) at a modest price. Service men stand guard, rescue me in peril and otherwise keep the streets from thoughtless action. Engineers have made fresh and hot water nearly free and accessible, the internet for all my command, insulation and space to sleep and settle, and transit, communications, efficiency in core goods etc.
            <br>&emsp;Such liberties are made available to all of us; and those things which are made and aimed for capital, are luxuries, as no one is hoarding the access to fire safety and vaccines. So, the threat of my life is beyond any reckoning, and the givens for comfort are all but too ingrained. Yet, in my stable place, I work, tending to my own post, admittedly ordinary but one no less. In a word, specialists have sacrificed their general capacities, honing their skills past the novelties of agriculutue, and setting them into metallurgy, law forming, theological and logical construction; moreso, has leisure come to be, with comedy, drama, horror, mimes, mourales, word play and dance. All at our quick and ready disposal. But, as I said, I have a role in all of this, and like most, it is of a common and basic kind, whereby the hills and land built up and around those miracles of ingenuity, call on me (and my simpler brethren) to man the toil, sweep the parkade, and otherwise be grateful that such meagerness is all thats required to access the brilliant freedoms around.
            <br>&emsp;So I am not an omnipotent man: no engineer has given me the tools to achieve that. Rather, I am a member of the world, one as I said which is built on the irons of progress, and accessed through the basic coins of community and exchange. I dream though, or yearn for something positive. For comfort and soft itineraries dont bring peace and joy in themselves, but merely remove any risk or strain in negativitie’s regards. But positivity, is something I move toward, happily, in and for itself: yet in this common place, albeit free of impurities, is not so enveloping or found, that I have any other impulse but to run -as if to break free from these midling grounds. And admittedly what I see that draws such rushing strides, is truly what I rightly seek, yet, the nature of this response reveals the problem I’m facing.
            <br>&emsp;You see, if the sun perks your mind, and your at liberty to need no guard, then the permitt to do that bears the consequent effect of you naturally heeding such attraction. For no one in peril attends to even the most pleasing of promises, for their mind and anticipation is shut from what lies comfortably ahead -but is instead pinned in the present. Without that pin, positive things will draw you, for your senses are at liberty to see and amend. Yet, the problem is in your means for action. If you were treating a threat, then your ability to do so would mark your probability of succeeding. We could summize this as both a means of effort and that of skill -where the effort is honed. In this sense, a positive stimuli needs something similar, so that when the warmer shades of life call you away, you have both the posture and gaze to meet them, taking them in. And so in the case for safety, when you know that you are now so and the threat is gone, so does that sparkle of life need its own closure -for you may at best feel a lingering interest for something of wonder and grace, yet of what you may not particularly know, nor be truly fufilled by the warmth it brings -as it may not be easy to greet it, ‘or take its hand’ as they say.
            <br>&emsp;#########To me, the cause of your irritability is in your ill composed state of action. Simply, you have not dealt with yourself enough to be capable of preparing the means to see and the concentration to engrave your findings down. And this is worth investigating whether or not your impurity is found amongst your common troubles, in that through those meddling affairs, whether you are even good enough for those. This is to be clear an awkward equation; for what comes first, the draw of goodness, the self regarded response, which solidifes your duty and ground beneath then permitts you too actively stair, or, do you see little for you are little, and in noticing the stress that even the average wares of modernity bring, you attend to yourself for the remedy of that, but in turn become upright and attuned, whereby the world is then in view. For me, this latter marks the path whereby you surpass the flatness beneath, and bend yourself to be strong and true in the worlds greeting, by you.

        <div id="marks">
            Everyone has those marks, acting like figures without definition. You hear a tune and it moves you in a way, or you read a phrase or watch a scene, and an image of your world comes to light. For me, Art is the process of capturing this; be it in Guernica or Stonehenge, there’s this draw from the world, heeding us to oblige. This response is hard to describe though. For be it in literature, gaming, film or the world, the spark is there from me -as we are drawn. But what we are in fact doing has little definition, or clarity that is. A useful example regards a dance, whereby the melody of a tune prompts us to choreograph how we are drawn to be. Perhaps, in short, the issue is that why we’d make art is unclear, or rather what its for. Simply, I suspect that it is a stride towards pure clarity, as a sheep can rest when no predators are in sight, so can man achieve something similar when he’s better addressed that recessed thought in his mind. At the base of it then, you might say that art is a reflection of certainty, and is found in all; for dolphins do something in their own fashion, whereby they playfully jump through the water. Obviously, this would not be the case if there were pressures or inclinations around; but as it is for us, so does freedom offer fainter impressions. As more clear ones generally reflect the evolution of our senses, and their effective bend towards survival, so would someone in a more liberated scenario see more, or at least be impressed by things which would otherwise not pass through the stern sight of nature’s harsher glare.
            <br>&emsp;Taking this to be true, we can highlight the obvious fact that Man experiences such a mechanic in its highest way. For just as we saw stars a millennia ago, so do we now see the abyss behind death’s door. Nor are we shortchanged of anything less than marvel and beauty; for as those in Northern Europe saw its respective sun (and built Stonehedge), or those of Egypt tributed Orion by building the Pyramids, so can I see the entirety of existence from the palm of my hand. By the power of optics I bend light, seeing how things appeared eons ago. Moreover, I hone those fibers inwardly, seeing the microbes around me, and that which I am composed of. I may not be able to articulate all that I’ve found, or be even set on the final mark: but from my studying at least, the world appears as intricate as our free’d mind could ever see, or believe.
            <br>&emsp;By those fashions, I see art as something merely useful, as would be the case for our alerting eyes, watching for predators at every snap of a twig behind. And although danger may not in fact hold all our curiositie’s regard, so are there feelings and insights unknown. At any rate then, I feel well founded in what we suppose, which is the fact that our ultimate aim of primitive intrigue, is rest; and in our modern times where entirety has delighted us as we entered that door, so do we similarly wish to mitigate those impressions, understanding them as we would of a suspicious sound behind. Equally though, our relief from a pen which signs some thought in our mind, or the dextrous dance of our creative respect for the stars and sky which appear so divine, yield us rest, in that we are clear in our impression; or, as someone builds a sculpture of war as to reflect the catharsis of letting those memories go, so can others around be imparted with similar relief.
            <br>&emsp;Worship though fairs differently, as we are not simply trying to get that tune out of our mind, or that thought on the page. Instead -and to be clear this is a bit antiquated- we see those more elaborate things around, which again, is to say that nature’s fainter mysteries pierce our condition’s thinning veil (whereby survival becomes more in our control, making us more open); and whereas art marks a response to such impressions which are relieving, or for rest that is, so is it common for others to actually take such flame and regard it deliberately, as if we were respecting the impression for what it strictly is, or seemed rather. So, whereas a hurricane may seem daunting and destructive, an artist illustrates a response in a way to deal with this; whereas others may in fact see the hurricane for something with agency, or as a result of some messenger. This is not so easy to distinguish, for me at least. But the idea of worship and superstition definitely fall in this place. Why, well that is what is hard to suppose. As we said, the veil of feeling alarmed dissipates as our resourcefulness grows; but so do we then see fainter objects around, such as the stars; or, perhaps, we notice things such as the seasonality of the world, whereby ingenuity prompts agriculture. There’s something old though, as if those ancient impressions were treated in too literal of ways. Or in other words, the impression from nature’s further ways got characterized unfoundedly. God is the worst of these perversions; for theology and the divine are in no ways wrong or poor to suspect, but that everything present isn’t already part of that plan, fairs less rightly. For the consequences have been that we attribute our own actions to what is accordingly suspected as ‘the lord’s response’; or rather, that based on our actions, he differs in whats ordained. So hurricanes are a result of sin -as compared to being a consequent result of the first cause- and other people’s misworship causes him to feel wronged -justifying genocides, or pogroms.
            <br>&emsp;Imagine, that death was always at your door. Granted, we have more knowledge that excludes those earlier positions, as such facts have made said positions fall by removing the assumptions (evidently as it’s become) that their based on. My thinking though, is that dealing with this is in the realm of art. For death, being in this case obvious, is not something that we mean to change, but rather find relief and understanding from. This however, is acquired through art, which is to say our signature on something as to make it more known. “Again, this remarks the clarity of the breaking twig.” It is possible then, that those of primitive times believed in God before they discerned his role in death. For I suspect that their view of the world expanded, and as that image became grander, so did the ‘thematic’ divinity settle into a portrait of agency and presence. And by that account, it would seem that the obvious notion of death, stood amidst those governed ways, to which our relief was not in reaching peace through passing away, but appealing to the one apparently in charge, ‘or guarding the door’. This could still be regarded as art then, for the mechanic here is in finding relief through securing a verifying response. “A signature if you will.” But just as the sun may pass us by, and for our pleasure we engrave our feelings through erecting monuments which reflect the harmony in place, so would we bend ourselves, or act at least in respect, to the one who holds entry into a preferred end upon death, and avoid the contrary place which our poor treatment seems to grant us. This is all art, in both mythical and natural regards. Our thinking is perhaps privileged then to be in touch with the latter, while the norms of the former are just not something we can describe. But, reasonably, I’d offer the notion of our sign, and that this applies in all scenarios, and that the reason people act as they did with respect to religion, was due to it being the only game in town. “And frightened people are hard to be sensible around; for if you are the latter, acting in line with natural cases, then so will those former see this contrary to what is required to respond to the divine; and partially, even if one has served dad well, so do other’s mistakes make him mad, the anger of which frightens those who have in fact done well. For in turbulent seas, not even those with secure rafts are safe.”
            <br>&emsp;Practically speaking then, the response of any being is circumstantial; for if it is before the ancients, then you may still be at a glaring stage, where the stars simply fill you with awe; or you may be in those times of antiquity, whereby rules and understanding were made of such shine; only, as it has become known, that such portion of nature’s glare did not tell all, and that the affairs of numerology, demagogy, astrology, and salvation, were ill respective to what nature’s ways really are. History is worth looking on, for we can see insights of things which still remain. And otherwise, it can help fill out the mold of what appears right for us to do right now -in our modern ways. Which is to say, that the relief we sought then is what we seek now; only the stimuli were different then, and in most ways unrepresentative to reality. Still, even now we are not so clear on that latter; but how nature appears and our present regard to conceive it, is no different than those before, and is in many ways fortuned to be based on a modern gaze.
            <br>&emsp;Art then is lasting, and its two main components being accuracy and prompt. The former, to reiterate, reflects appearances; that is, if a sparse yet bright light shines ahead, is it in fact a divine being, or a glob of fissionable hydrogen? The latter appears more true, thus making our treatment of that well founded, in comparison at least to thinking it has a mind, and finding relief (through art) of that. Secondly though, regards the prompt. For one, we can use the twig example, and say that the relief sought here is based on safety, for if our suspicions are correct, there is in fact danger. It may not be, but we are at least curious through an understandable guard. When we were younger though and those stars first appeared, I suspect that they were not initially turned into governing gods -or at least the inspiration for so wasn’t there. In this way, such as those who built Stonehenge, the treatment, or relief rather of this unclear feeling, was that which remarked our awe, or wonder that is. These are quite privileged experiences to respect, as although they may sit within the molds of uncertainty -which in effect is rooted in keeping us safe- so is our curiosity born from something which seems pleasing, or positively intriguing no less. A great example is that person who first entered the water. “We don’t know what’s in there!” someone said, to which others joined in, “and its cold, and we’re not able like fish!” Still, something drew someone for the first time; and when they went into somewhere relatively shallow and clear, they probably threw their arms up, yelling “it’s safe, and look,” as they front crawled around, “I cannot float, as you said, or breathe for that matter, but I can swim.” And everyone jumped in then and expanded their limits. That, you might say, is relief of curiosity in a freeing kind. For as we said, nature brought us to care for things close by, as predators and our needs of survival were always paramount. But as those worries grew less dense, so did the veil of danger thin, giving our curiosity more scope, and according subjects to see. These are the mysteries of freedom as we’ll call them. “For who, in more troubled times, would have the time to make ironic comedies: so privileged were those Greeks!”

        <div id="natureshand">
            So art is life in a way, or rather the response we have to things marks our persisting nature. “For there is always something to amend, and we the amenders.” Overall, the cursive so to speak requires concentrated time, either in elaboration or affirmation. I can say on the local scale though that my life is angling itself towards the brightest of those responses. Perhaps, as I’m thinking, our plea to do so is that we feel empty otherwise. And although moving forward is curtailed by an understanding of ends, so are we still best in some form of motion. As it were, too much and you run right over, while those who go too slow come to a stop. And weirdly, rest cannot truly be achieved with the body, for we are always breathing, heeding tomorrow. We can at most be in a resting state, which is to say that our movement forward is more tender than rugged, but also not squishy and soft. And so our draw to the sun is so that our senses are not otherwise on guard; and in those freer ways, does our mind catch fainter things which are farther off; or at least things which shine and glimmer, as opposed to those which feel looming and worth our guard.
            <br>&emsp;The thing is, in this place where more is seen and of a positive kind, our yearn to move forward is that it breathes life which is otherwise not there, for we are not in any alerted state, or need for survival. As we said, the wish to proceed is so our life can feel like its living; for death is known, or the end at least, and being still feels like its right at you, though the result is more anxious than it is of an actual response to death’s prescence. And so we heed what our free mind sees, for we wish to move forward and embrace our time’s delight. Personally, this has become our resolve; and although the reasoning isn’t strong, we are in fact social creatures, meaning we find pleasure and encumbency in partaking with others, for we otherwise feel hidden in our human world. Simply, we wish to post, or at least promulgate what we see, for at least in those moments the merely private thoughts will have a broader sort of company. The former (our thoughts) can hold inquiries and respect for death, but of film, literature, gaming and study, so can that be public. We are free enough to do it, and in terms of what is granted, it is the ability to do so; and achieving this is so when the production is done: and the trouble then is in the experience, or completion rather of the work, as opposed to the profit you make.
            <br>&emsp;In that case, our world is already there, at least the edge of it I can see. But we are not so privileged to have already known or embraced its many portions, or segments at least. These are the fires which our hand moves off of, only in this case the response here is one where we put our signature right on the flame. For, in the former’s case, we are instructed by what will provide us with living; while in the free times of the latter, where the sun draws your gaze, so are we avoiding the scorched effect of idleness, by engraving whats felt about that shine. As it were, we both graze and defend; when the threats are removed though, so are we left with grazing; only, in the case of a monkey or deer, their fine to relax and chew, for their guard is prepped to come back up. “Nothing to do is a relief.” Whereas these modern times have removed the barbarians around, and our inner armories have fallen away. Yet, we are still alive, and of those senses which danger used to attack, so are they present still: the difference being that beauty and opportunity of nature is held more clearly for those senses to see. “Before, opponents and our attention grappled, pairing off like hot and cold. Now, however, the duo is one of appreciation and respect, whereby our partner of nature in her pleasing ways, fairs us a liberal task, ‘where we learn to hold her hand’.”

        <div id="utilityofqualities">
            As one who is intelligent, the world is never known. Perhaps that is due to our curiosity, in that whenever we’ve reached the end, so do we ask, growing the possibilities further. And this is fine for the most part, as being unprivy to omnisicence, which is to say (fully)aware of what is, benefits one who exists in such enclosure in that they can further refine and define both their views and according amend.
            <br>&emsp;What I’ve noticed in light of this, is that we are more or less asked to reach a conclusion. Not, to be clear, in our views, or rather our sight, but our actions; they must be in motion, advancing at least regardless of end. The issue though, clearly, is just as the world exists despite our knowledge, so can the consequences, or gains rather of our actions, treat us in necessary ways, of which our inital intent would have been other if such ends were known. Yet who are we to ever then say what we should do, ‘for what farthest point can truly heed where all actions should go?’.
            <br>&emsp;Personally, this issue has been rectified over the recent year by the merrits of quality. These, simply amount to what qualifies an action, in that if it were well, or worth trusting by virtue of a welcomed end, that it would be so because it held certain elements, or qualities rather. Whereas in contrast, for brevity sake, we would say that those results which were unfavorable, made the prior course a vain one. Furthermore, we can cleanly define said qualities, with the minor caveat that a lack of whats good will at least make something closer than not to the bad. For example, we may say that irksomeness is an undesirable attribute for our gains to have; but we may be effectively direct about it, and simply say that what is desirable is rest, or at least a return of nourishment and strength; and by virtue of that, if those things are not acquired, then we are by definition, to a degree at least, undesirable of our ends. And, in short, we can rightfully say that the elements, or properties rather, worth our dearest regard, are those of substance, or flavor, constancy, or regularity, and ease, or smoothness via disposition.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, if we are ever more experiencing what we want in both a consistent and accesible way, then of a result we will say that it is of the stoutest kind; and within that mold if the matter is sweet and pure, then of this fully formed way we’ll say, that it is of the strongest kind. I make the distinction of the flavor and form, in that a readied and quick state of drudgery and fear, is no taste one wants, however solid in it’s form. “We want the best and greatest flavors all the time, and without the need to sell our soul, or move mountains that is: from ourselves we’ll say marks the road being right, or with benefit at least when compared to those which require tricks and treks.”

            Form wise, it may seem in fact proper for your senority to be when you have children. Though, if child rearing is seen as an element of living, then it can in some sense be part of your adult life, in that you are still doing. The requirments though seem to be guided by intent, as opposed to there being any harsh restriction. And in that case, our own life is whats worth regard, for only when that is full and rich in integrity, will we be fine and able to give.
            <br>&emsp;And, perhaps what I see is that our time as adolescent is really just the latter half of our childhood, whereby we apply what we’ve learned in our youth. For just as one gives a three year old any hard time, so would the outgrowth of that be the beginning of true development -or road to adulthood. In that sense, our adolescence is where we apply ourselves in the world, becoming secure and able to make complete steps. What we are applying though is akin to grammar, in which our youth (or pre-adolescence) is catered upon. What differs though from this model, is traditionally you enter the age of learning, learn grammar from then till the point where you begin applying those skills in higher learning; only then do you apply it in the world. This pains me, for why would you learn the basis for the elements which you would then go and learn? No one speaks that way, as that is more ingrained by mimicry. “No one knows why an orange is called that, but they say so anyway.” And fundamentally, if you can spell one thing, why not the other? And are we really saying that by the time you were seven, that you could not spell? In truth, there were words unfamiliar to me, but our skills were surely the same as they were when we finally came across those. I just think that our youth should be combined, as it were, from elementary through highschool, into a formative period after you are five. If your pupil cannot say a phrase, count arithmically, or write in prose by that time, then your training is off. In fact, my experience is that the reason we need so much time to achieve so, is that we really do little at all. Ask yourself, how much math would you do per week in grade 7? Even if you had an hour 3 times per week, plus some homework, how much time are you really doing math? In particular, how much are you really doing arithmetic, for equations are fairly useless besides technical pursuits? Were raising men, not workers; for if we wish to be technicians, such as engineers, then we’ll learn the formula then. I’m not saying not to learn cosine and circumference, but just as algebra is a the prior step to derivatives, so can all math be traced back to those primary points; and if robustness (of a kind) is not only what we seek, then we’ll apply ourselves then. But don’t we want to be so robust across the field? My student would know the whole of cosmology and astronomy, the history of the world and its dinosaur kings; they’d know who was great, and how empires rose and liberty fell; and they’d admitt passages of purity and greatness, for at least if they were outside freedom’s realm, so could they amend to their misfortune.
            <br>&emsp;I guess, in other words, I don’t see how the mathematical rigor that we need to exist creatively, sincerely and kindly in the world, could not be achieved in 5 years, whereby we’d then allow those who had learned to go and apply themselves in those behavioral kinds. For what are we doing otherwise? And by virtue of contemporary thinking, do you really need anything to achieve a common trade? And imagine, sitting someone through the passivity and formalities of grade 1 through 12, where they could instead engage with the whole of knowledge from the earliest years, then run through the world as they can, painting and addressing wherever they go. Then, for the sake of argument, if all else failed and the concerns of tradition prevailed, they’d get a trade. An even more contemporary thought is that pursuits of anything less within elsewhere kinds, is in fact less oppertune and treating. “Journeymens over liberal Art majors in debt.”
            <br>&emsp;So, in summary, our child will go through their youth in a much briefer time, advancing into adolescence during their teenage years. By 20 they should be a man, working to blossom from that most secure mold. Personally, as a parent, this takes nothing more that generosity and sincere regard; the teachings from us require nothing more than time, and the application of the student need not more than the simplicities of a roof and bread. They can find their own way then, truly. For we may still hold a leash as they go out into the world, for in that stance they are merely learning in a fuller position. But having then grown, they can then fully be, whereby they truly apply what they’ve acquired into something personal to themselves. By then, may we offer what we have, as a dowrie of sorts. In preparation, we could define our child’s rearing as one of a local kind; for we will want the support and comfort of family and home during the early years, and although not restricted, we may not wish to or need to travel during their learning years. When they can helm themselves though in that adolescent sense, so may we all go, for in foreign lands they will be able to walk besides us. Or in another sense, the place for child rearing is that stretch where you have to carry them, which is to say till the end of their youth. This, reasonably, is about 10 years, ‘for who could not run and speak by then? The parent just needs to raise them so that they can be brought along’.
            <br>&emsp;As per our plan, we can define it as needing to reach a point where a child’s youth can be developed. And in terms of expectation, we could say that from this point of ours from adulthood and beyond, that we are going through a stage perhaps, whereupon its completion we’d be ready to give, or at least live in that truly generous way. But, just as one’s youth is the first half of things and adolescence the other, so could we consider our blossoming years (as an adult) as the youth of that, while the adolescent portion is where we spill over, and give. For as it were, this point of our life is simply that where we have an unadorned aim; this does not mean that duty and care take no attention, or that our ends will effortlessly come to be; but rather, we’ve been firm enough and constant to see an aim born from the right experience. As the effort is still required, so are we growing. Perhaps all I mean to say, is that right now were conjuring the sincerest of generosity, in that our core is taken care of in its aim, and our helming of this will bring out our dearest gain. In comparsion to what a child needs though, in that must our gifts be known, in that what was true was already given, or rather generated by me. “For we are then full, as in the blossomed state of a complete mold.” And upon that, our offerings will be encumbunat, spilling over if you will, for we had not only reached a point where we are made, but where the truth in that was claimed: and only from there will we truly give, for we then had much to offer. “And the interest of reaching so is what bars me from seeking that overly generous claim, for I am in fact seeking our fullest self, whereupon reaching so our satisfaction will come from giving it away.” ####Term wise I cannot say, but this is at least the mark of our adhultood blossoming; from that point where we have a gift, to the latter of its state I might say, though this may be another point I do not know.

        <div id="rightandwrong">
            It is clear that we are incomplete. For in our lack, I can tell that we are so. Descriptions though seem pail in comparison to remarking on our actual living, which at this point is minor.
            <br>&emsp;As a man, I care for other people. But right here, the crux of an issue lies, ‘for who would prefer the company of liars over themselves’. The reason is simple, in the sense that sugar is indeed a comfort, albeit poor in consequence, or lacking nourishment at least. People are like this, as their actions may in fact run contrary to well-founded living. This is so, for in our environment and our nature through it, there is a lucrative way; that is, one which yields us with the tenets of good living. For one thing, the means for this is primarily qualified over multiple entries, ‘for randomly choosing each step will not hold a profit forever’. We also are not trying to learn everything for this sake of wellness, but rather notice things about ourselves as to develop a genuine scale. Only, certain questions and curiosities may embellish, leading us to inquire about things far known. In that search, inquiry marks our forward output, as we sketch what we see around; science then confirms this via skepticism, for our view may not be as it personally seems. The strength of knowledge then is that it reflects what is indeed true; and as a practical measure, we can say that of those things which should be known, is found through inquiry, and of those verified, or reasoned upon at least, makes them laudable to act on.
            <br>&emsp;The struggle here is in learning about the world compared to assessing ourselves; for if we are anxious, or at least attentive to a moment of rest, then understanding what constitutes both the experience and cause of this, will angle us sincerely to the world. Only, as war never seems fitting, of a choice that is for peaceful outputs, so is it unclear where and when we should arrange ourselves to experience what we must. In a weird way, our definition of the world may in fact be a reflection of ourselves. For we may say that a man’s life is marked by death, but in effect this is merely a conclusive jump born from it appearing from me, regarding us personally and how we are bound for so. I’m not sure if family and friends are really a factor of our lives; or better said, that even if observation deals me with such, is that sound? For what range are we accounting for, and to which end, for could such elements not change?
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps the strongest reasoning is an evalutive one; for in all things are we acting, but really our inquiry is born for the sake of acquiring what is right and wrong. These are so though on a desirable end, or a positive one at least. “For none ask and define so that they may fail; assumptions aside, our ends are at least banked on what seems positive, even if it is only to us: or rather, that within the world as it is, and, in a way, what actions would in fact serve us in who we actually are, so might our view be off. But even the fool has his own desirable end.” This is the mighty question then, which at first glance centers on deciding what is right and wrong: only, I see another. Simply, what makes the aims of a masochist false, while those of a volunteer correct? Well, in laying it all out, there are apparent shortcomings for the former, while none for the latter. But better said, the one who serves has very little taken of them which is of worth, nor can they ever fail to give, and in turn earn the pleasure of doing so; or better yet, giving expansively in the rewards that it offers -whereas drugs give less and less as they require more. The details of one who harms themselves, or wishes to be harmed, or harm others, or see others harmed, may in fact derive them pleasure; but I only suspect that family, confidence, self-respect of a sincere kind and other things of our common sort, exist roughly within these course of actions. “For you are either capturing, or being done so, which appears to offer little lasting rest or content.” By virtue of that, these ends seem set to eventually wain, and are otherwise hard to acquire by virtue of the pain involved. “For rebuttal or escape riles your subject.”
            <br>&emsp;Now, the heart of our inquiry, is how can we discern what appears right, and in a way is locally positive, from that which is actually proper, in that its positive result is one of real worth. In other words, if I am a thief, then my success in doing so will not yield me the highest result of man. Whereas, an attention and care to death, family, leisure and friends, upon success, will yeild me a life which qualifies more highly. In a word, as if life were our aim, would the best shot be the one which hit the middle of the best mark? “And the struggle of the scholar, the boy, is that he not only will miss the core of that latter mark, but that the world will reflect on so, and usher him to hit the center of one less righteous.”

        <div id="eternityorends">
            Let’s say, for instance, that death were in fact final. Regardless if this was in fact preferred, we can at least be sure what it is, and otherwise amend our prior time accordingly. On the latter, if the case were contrary, and typical let’s say in that we were judged, then our living time would be best to respect the conditions which most favorably determined our eternal end. Seeing, however, that the finality of death requires nothing for us -for we will be nothing- than no fear or concern of consequence need be regarded. “This isn’t to confuse our aniticpations of being in such state, only that which and whatever they are, banks little on how we are before.” Weirdly though, that being within nothing affords no experience familiar to those living; which is to say, that neither hope or apprehension are present, ‘for in that final state, we are none, resting, sincerely at ease, for our actions are forgone and ill set on happening, which, in effect, means theres nothing to be fearful of or excited for, as if we could in fact grow -or change’. That is the ultimate question. Not as to whether our ignorant claims will come true, but whether it will be one which treats us the most preferable, in that we are free to be free, and accordingly occurs by our current virtue of being, in that, definitively, we are done -or final. So my doubts are such that the void of space feels, well, empty. This seems obvious, but to be clear, all I mean is that there appears to be no void at all. “For where is there nothing truly?” Everything else seems to be considerable, ie. the emptyness of space, of which there are still properties, and what not. In any case, this does not remove any notion of there being nothing beyond death. Better put though, it is not so simple to say that if there is nothing more than material, which is to say that myths are unnecessary to explain every single thing, that death would then itself be explained. In fact, I only define death as well as I can relate it to something similar, being sleep. Though, of a peaceful kind, which in a way holds our experience at least within the realm of nothing, ‘that is, rest’. And so, our range is not appropriately known. For one, the cause of death is in regards to tissue, or our body going astray. But even then, if ‘we’ are somehow but attached to that, or at least the part of us which is alongside that body, then the question of where it goes is an unclear one. “For the timeless concern, is whether or not we end?” In that, I make happy claims that if it were so, that this would suitably compare to nothing, and thus be appropriately described as peaceful. Still, that we will end is not clear.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, the belief in it being otherwise holds its strength, or reasoning at least, on two fairly frail stands. For one, we wish it to be so, for we either desire what the afterlife could bring, or are otherwise afraid of what nothing bestows. On this last count, the obvious dispute is that our ignorance and poor thinking of what nothing means -or our end rather- makes us fear it accordingly. Personally, at a glance, it is quite easy and sound to describe it as a peaceful state, ‘for nothing is going on’. Considering these as motivations, the second aspect reflects our negation of an otherwise truth. For starters though, we must be explicitly set on the fact that the lack of certainty for nothing, does not claim any for the eternal realm. Unless either has undeniable truth, then likelihood is all we’ll get. In that though, for each, there is reasoning that proports strength in each side of belief. Since the case in point is to do with our ultimate end though, ‘it is hard not knowing’. And in fact, all actions are in a way rendered mute, seeing as there is the possibility that depending on the ones we take, a lasting (or at least further) consequence can be yeilded. In addition, if we are sure of our end -within nothing’s embrace- then so will we be free, ‘for our end holds nothing but an open door’. Whereas, if we only know the reasons for the alternative to not be true, so is the former unnecessarily so. For all we know in that case, is that there is no heaven or hell, but if there are routes beside that, only can a specific certainty disclose. In simpler terms, the negative of our contrary is not proof of the latter’s place, for the case here is at most symbolically opposed; ‘yet, how can we be sure that our destination is not in some other recess, or nearby point of ridges’. To be clear, removing strength from eternity and weakness from our end, does give us means for rest, or confidence at least. But so can’t we know.
            <br>&emsp;Let’s be real however. If our end is so, then nothing is required of us, ‘for our dissipation comes so easy’. Thus, if we are confident that such an end is true, then the according lack of requirment can also be stood behind. In any case, so long as there is doubt that this is so, then we cannot fully believe that our path is so -and its granted accord. Moreover, seeing as the lack of certainty here allows for suspicion elsewhere, so must those accords be heeded. At any rate, eternity may be hard to disprove; and seeing as its claim is on our actions before death, so does its lingering head need regard. This is the conflict you see, for even if we believe it not so, its otherwise partial claim still signals its demands; and ignoring those consequences (if left undealt), fares gravely to those who were false in acting otherwise.
            <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, we may have little reason to believe that the afterlife is true; and in that case, we may harbor the potential harm of ignoring it. And otherwise, if an end is not truly known, than so can other possibilities be regarded (alongside eternity). For the principle at least, is that an end or not, covers only some of the ground. “For just as the universe is not too slow, or too fast, but moves just enough to lower its pace, but never stops.” Still, just as we can let the rust of eternity linger in the back of our mind, so can we dispose ourselves to an otherwise end, lavishing at least in its most likely promise. We cannot be certain, but confident rather, that what such an end requires, is a good thing to respect. For even if we were foolish not to uncover lurking possibilities, so is the case for Nothing overly grown; and understandably at least, that just as those before ignorantly fell under God’s command, so can we now happily go, to where we not know, but pleasingly to our hopeful end. “How ironic, that the peril of eternity is but a scar of our certainty, lingering by the merrits of not being clear otherwise. Moreover, how nice is it, that what is so worth achieving is something which holds no consequences or demand. How weird is it that we’d be foolish to accept that course, and what, be mistaken, and given what’s otherwise.”

        <div id="preferredrest">
            So, in summary, our end may be or not so. If it is the latter, this only means there will be no real peace or rest, while the former means otherwise. A tricky component though, is differing an afterlife from nothing. For, the former may seem like an end, and be peaceful at that, but it is still something of sorts. Moreover, is it banked on both a positive and negative end -heaven or hell. What seems to be the case, is that when we are gone, so is our experience. For, as it were, all our experience is right now is akin to syllables of a word, where the case here holds things akin to thoughts and speech. In particular, talking amounts to muscles producing consonants and vowels, whereby the tongue cuts them (so to speak) as to produce variety. “Think of saying Faaaa, and Ooooh.” At any rate, these are not some phenomena, at least as outputs. Where and how their produced, or originate from rather, is more complex, but we can at least say that be it of some dualistic mind, or computational/responsive conduct of tissue, that the results are object like.
            <br>&emsp;In a word though, the truth seems more in line with the latter. And, just as words are made accordingly, so are images and other cognitive elements of our waking experience. If these are truly born of tissue, or at least (as products) are themselves born and of a tissue’d kind, then so is the dissassembly of that which outputs so, a valid mechanism by which our experience simply grows from containing those mental elements, to one where we do not. In other words, the birth of matter is the origin of us, and as it configured, so did it create those mental objects. Death, it seems, in a practical way reflects the limit of that configuration, whereby the bodies molecules can no longer retain their general form -which is to say, that we do age and grow, but so do we remain a person, where death is the removal of that.
            <br>&emsp;This is a very natural way of looking at it. Although the dynamics of will and ingenuity are hard to describe, in their products at least, so can we fairly set these as elements which we don’t understand. “But so with a mystery, can we qualify who the perp would be.” Our remarks then are akin to our ancestoral insight that the seasons occur, and that planting food in accordance can yeild a surplus. We, in this modern sense, are making no different of accounts, only in this case the apparent mark of death ahead is whats drawn our gaze. Again, the dynamics are hard, but just as the history of man and his dextrous resovle can be traced to erectus, hominins, cyodants and eukaryia in general, so can his regard for death be addressed via the same root; which is to say the domain of reality itself. For it brought matter into its configurations, of which stars, planets, microbes and self regard were made.
            <br>&emsp;In a word then, description marks our interest, for we know that we are comparable to the rest, and by virtue of that equally born of existence’s origins, to which our only aim is to understand how our particular arrangement will proceed. On that account, we know that we’ll disassemble. Here though, we can see that all things worth being afraid of are unable to be administered: “For the means by which they poorly treat us, has no vessel to corrode.” And although complex, the goods of living being absent, is no far trouble, especially for one who is not ignorant. For we are not talking about things which make us vain, but the true wonders of nature and her delight. These however are mere fortunes of being so free, ‘as our watchful eye is granted leave to stair at the stars’. The organ is the same though, however liberated in seeing more pleasant things: and the suiter of those instruments, whether in danger or awe, simply wants rest. “There is much reason to think that our glorious stair, is but a less harsh interest in need of clarity -as a broken twig behind that is.” Defining this as rest, as our grand aim that is -in liberal or wretched chains- removes any hesitance from death’s bareness of living. “For that in its most is still but a preferred route to being, which is to say that through more positive clarities, we acquire rest.” And that’s what death is.
        </div>
        <div id="messagesfordeath">
            What would you do if your actions in life accounted for your experience upon its end? This is a tricky question. For one, we generally take granted both that this is in fact true, but more importantly we presume, or at least are keen on advice given, with respect to what actions would be suitable -if the former was true.
            <br>&emsp;The thing is that heaven and hell are fairly characterized, as if there were literal doors, helmed by a man no less. In this sense, the appropriate conduct towards such ‘familiar bends’ is one that seems unfounded. Nevertheless, the motivation in this case may be sound, or at least we’d rightly qualify our actions based on their consequences. The real question then, is how can we be sure that our resolutions are correct? That is, what do preferable ends need, which we’ll assume means heaven, and what actions correspond to that in an effective way?
            <br>&emsp;The problem, is that there is almost no reasoning behind this. People do have insights and or experiences, but these usually amount to some indirect or direct message, ‘as if a whisper from the land in which we seek to enter’. Only, we still must tie our shoes, and are otherwise ordained to breathe, eat, sleep, and more or less persevere. Adding efforts aimed at our final end is no false treatment, but doing so may in fact run contrary to those former. In any case, the lack of reasoning for why were doing such amends is the critical fault; for despite one’s confidence in the messenger, what exactly have we learned? What is it about the aim we have, and its nature in other words, that asks us to do something in a ceratin way? Because personally, what it seems to me, is that these whispers amount to suggestions for one as they proceed through the normal world. As it were though, this simply means that as natural actions occur, so is there a right one, the guidance of which were given.
            <br>&emsp;The main concern though, is that besides these messages, which in a way amount to nothing more than principles or occasional actions, they do not detail how in any given moment we should proceed. Who is to say that one action would be or would not be of a certain? But the problem rears its head then; for all were trying to do is amend to the keeper who holds heaven’s door, and as if it were held with content, meaning that those in charge knew that none would so effortlessly come through the door. Or in other words, we are by our own natures unprivy to what eternity seeks, which is why any minor insights are so precious.
            <br>&emsp;Strangely enough though, man has resolved himself to ask about all the things that his guidance has not treated him. In a way, this is fair, for the Gods must mean for us to question upon their offered rules (of principle that is), how in any given scenario one should act with respect to them. Only, in our growing age, so has that consideration turned to the nature of inquiry itself, whereby we ask what the ends really are, and whether the realm around is really present, and there for us to rightfully amend. Perhaps it is, but at least so far, Man’s previous descriptions have been revealed as wrong. Again, on the whole of it he’s not gone too far, but in the specifics he evidently has. This may be his one failure, while the mold above welcomed a truth otherwise. In effect though, as the truth in things has become known, the realm itself has begun to loose its claim. Personally, I find its place an overwhelming one, and not neccessarily a preference. Still, I will admitt its worth in regard, but only because I am not sure otherwise, or completely unsure of itself.
        </div>
        <div id="confirmation">
            Peace seems the most pleasing, if even freedom could grant us such. It is perhaps our real condition, that time has gone on, for we’ve developed from a troubled stage, into eras which seem by gone. Yet, in our liberated ways, we know not how to live: and the prediciment is that we must -or risk being idle- while referencing the fact that we currently don’t know how. In this sense, we are ordained to solve this problem. How is one to live when life is truly given? Your free, set, clear to run your line: but which one is it? Hmmm, what do I really seek? I’ve spent my years training for war and conflict, or at least in recent times the focus has been on opportunity and progress. What will I now do that all that could be hoped for is gained? The stars seem ever brighter, and the land around seems quiet and plain, yet what am I, as a member, to do with it?
            <br>&emsp;And my anwser comes down to the notion of purpose; yet the rounding figure of all this is that we truly want rest. An example might illustrate the point. Our father is sick, and as it were he is not in good health by his own merrits. What I would say to him is that he should exercise, yet he believes it futile or without promise. To this I say he is stubborn. If I were to be more direct though, I might mistakenly say that his error is in being stubborn; but this is really a twisting of the real concern, which is that he doesn’t take care of his health. I may suggest that his receptivity to this is lacking, but such stiff-headedness is not the real cause, but rather the heated surface surrounding the core issue of his lack of exercise. Comparing this to what we previously said, I would say that a purpose will bring one in line with themselves, and through bad times carry them forward, or in good times keep them content and focused. This, more or less, seems to be what were looking for in our liberal ways. Only, as in that example, the core issue here (in this instance I mean) is of rest -or the actual shortcoming of exercise (as in that last instance). This is primarily so for that is what a remedy of our condition is staked towards. And, as we’ve mentioned prior, that one’s confirmation of their secure surroundings (in primitive days) is no different than ones tribute to the stars; their each marks, of which our response is drawn as to bring us in line with them. For each though, the harmony brings rest. And so in our free ways we remain conditioned. As to what exactly, that can be further discussed; but in short we can agree that things do still draw us, albeit of a more positive kind. “The idea being that our senses open up to the broader environment as those near handed threats recede.” And in a way, if I saw the stars for instance, and my response to them was to write, chart, reflect, discuss and or constuct, then you could say, that to my purpose, it was in aligning ourselves to those, the objective being one of increased resolution and inquiry, ‘as if were refining a spot which we inched closer towards’. And you could say, if asked why such actions were in place, that they served the purpose of bringing harmony, or in other words they relieved your condition. Just as one would say that the purpose of exercise was health, so too could the mere relfection of ourselves be explained as a means of learning who we are, and establishing a richer grasp -which is what we mean to do when we identify and tribute the stars, or things of wonder.
            <br>&emsp;“I think, in short, that this idea of rest, or what we call peace, is the most usefull idea around, for it both explains why someone would do what they would in ancient times, and those where they are free. Only, I feel like the substance in need of refinement is in disclosing and thus affirming the fact that in such open and clear times, do we, and if so, what do we actually see?. For the treatment of that is what marks the purpose of relieving our otherwise idle condition: yet what if our eyes are closed?”
        </div>
        <div id="tonothing">
            For simplicity sake, the spawn of, or at least effected impetus which gave rise to matter, is itself the rear half of our origins. What we are though, as in the sameness of a person from birth to death -in that as a person they stay- so are we the same -by virtue of our spot within the configuration- by the roots of the Sun, its planetary debris, the heat and its effects on the ground and atmosphere, the process which naturally shaped the world from here and all the complexity born from that: the end being us, or of mammals, eutherians, hominins and Homo.
            <br>&emsp;And so when one asks, ‘where did we come from’, they must be clear in whether their asking where they, as a strand of all things, in particular came, or how (as if it were the same altogther, differing only within the domain) the whole, or matter that is, came to be. “Why is there anything at all,” is a angle to this question that differs from, “how did my particular form within things, come to be?”
            <br>&emsp;For those who are the age of five, I would say keep reading as to make your faculties up to a speculative par; but for those who are near eight, then I would say, in counsel, that figuring out the answer for both, can be helmed more effectively by stamping in a suitably explicit line of distinction, between the lineage of the whole, and the latter itself; whereby we, fairly, attribute the former aspect as all those things derived from the sun, while the components of that -be it galaxies and atoms- are given more fundamental regard as to how they (as the root elements of matter) came to be. It is true that we could simply say that atoms and what not mark that explicit line, of which we sit on one end as products, while the unknown lurks deeper as the atom’s cause. But, simply, we can at least rest ourselves on the notion that beyond the fundamental concern, that of its impetus to things itself, that regions of its consequent massiveness are themselves appropriately considered as derivivaties of the locales within said regions of massiveness: stars.
            <br>&emsp;Imagine if all objects were in fact not so, but rather figures of an otherwise primary matter. Now, one might say that such element itself would have to bow to the laws of existence and the according continuity. I will consent to that, but only so much as were sure that the element itself is of a kind which is always lasting. Now, this is a bit circular, but working from the back, we can see that at the very least a reason for it being so (real and constant) is not neccessarily so by virtue of the apparent constancy of its products. That is, if we are mere figures of it, then so would the inconstancy of it mean we are as well. Even in literal terms, we brush away like erosion by the wind; only, where do those dust particles go: and could they not be but mere elevations (of a granular sort) in an otherwise flat, or receding existence?
            <br>&emsp;In other words, the main element is all that matters; or at least so much as the products of it are but mere figures of it, then so will those fates meet the same. The question then, is why does there have to neccessarily be something at all? That there is something per say, is no evidence of there actually being anything; for although the dynamics of what ‘nothing’ would be otherwise, wherein the supposed prescence of things suggests there is something, fairs only so ostensibly, which is to say that, perhaps, that such evident things are but sprouts of nothing ceasing to be so, but is (literally) none the less. “That is perhaps the hardest concept, but only because in my conceit to what is in fact not, makes it hard to identify otherwise: for I must contest against there being something, by saying its not there.”
            <br>&emsp;I am trying to describe those sprouts, in that they are like reflections in the mirror, but not reflective of the mirror itself. Why the medium (so to speak) sprouts is one thing, and why its nature is such that its ‘nothingness’ is not always contained, is not clear. But per the model, all these things which we see, from suns to empty space, are but mere sprouts of reality rippling in its folds. The words limit us in this case, for we can sit cleanly on the spot of ‘nothing being the aim’ -to which our nature as the sprouts of that reflect. But of such folds, are they not of an existence? But at this point there is a limit, or prescence of fallacies otherwise (if we affirm otherwise, with ignorance) in our depiction. I have it though. At least I can say what it is I am trying to describe. It is not so much a negation, as if what we believed was of existence can in fact be taken away; but in that, the nothing I speak of is not exactly so, for in this case we are simply saying that by virtue of something being removed, nothing follows. In fact, if I may digress, this marks a fairly basic mistake; that is, if we take a plate and say it has no food, then were saying that within the medium there is absence; but of this, we only mean that there is an emptiness to the mold, or holder. Space follows this formost, in that even it, in all its emptiness, is not really so. Here, to me at least in our primitively future driven age, the core problem arrives. How is there anything not of space? For if that is absent of all which we’d call things, but is composed of something itself, then how is there not something everywhere? How could nothing ever be? I suspect that it is all in the wording, in that its not that the emptyness of space, in being so universal, is in fact of existence (so to speak), and thus making a presence of something everywhere, but rather, that the mold, or plate, is in fact nothing itself, and accordingly home to ‘things’ -ie. food on, but not present to a plate- which are in fact not true things themselves: instead, they are what anything amidst a void would be, at least sincerely, nothing. “For me personally, the ostentible flavor to physics, and the misappropriation of ontology based on existence, dissolves under the relief of the greatest anwser, the question of which is, how is all not so, when in fact there is but mere glimmers shining through nothing, yet there is, postively, partial things which appear absolutely so? For where do they as unexisting things go, if they are in fact somewhat so? Or is nothing not simply an abscence, or openess on the plate thats so, but a nature which (overall), reflects the pieces struggling to be amidst the destiny of a ‘nothing’ course?” And the virtue of that, is that short of our descriptions to do so, that all, if under a course for being not, is not a mark of full being, or at least of true things which become not; for of what appears so, they are present by the fate and treatment of the mold they exist in; and if a mold is either not there, or (by our limits) set for nothing itself, then so are the products of that of an according sort. “Whereby the products of a nature which was bound for its own self and such products, would make the former at least equally cogent with the wholeness of that core matter; yet, if the latter (self- core matter) was not something (by virtue of it heading away from being full), then would the strands of that not be of an equally (destined) dissolute sort?”

        <div id="confession">
            I’ve never lacked humility, rather a non-contempuous ease, as to approach problems and theory without pride or insecurity.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, I am reading Tolstoy’s confession, and the prose has me intrigued. However, he makes rather extreme positions regarding the rational view of life’s meaninglessness, and, the admittedly fair (by this context) comparison of faiths alternative place as the sole means of finding that meaning. As he puts it, ‘there is the finite which were part of, and the infinite which we can reckon, yet by all reasonable accounts, the latter is composed of nothing, and so to our fates; yet, by the former’s account, the end is one where eternity is our claim, yet in believing this to be so, you are attesting to the faith you have in it, rather than reasonable expectation’.
            <br>&emsp;And for the most part I see strength in this. Moreover, despite my early restraint, I found myself ceasing defense as I understood my own life was more in line with faith, rather than reason. But, the crux of all this scouring, is due to the value that is placed on nothing, and its according meaninglessness. For one, I cannot vouch for their statements, as I at most know the heart of it; yet, explicitly, he remarks (citing Schopenhour) that the world is indeed meaningless and of nothing, but then attributes evil to this and the life were in. This confuses me. I guess the argument goes that something is preferable to nothing, and that because we are destined for the latter, so is the former a farce. And I won’t make an ignorant appeal that their thinking is off, for I am in most ways willing to accept their findings. Yet, their evaluation, which I must stand firm in negating further sophistries, holds no bearing for me.
            <br>&emsp;This is so, for the nothing I see, personally or at least of agreement with them, is not so negative in my mind. In fact, I would describe the barreness which they define as one of favor, as I put it, like a dark, dreamless, tranquil sleep. That portrait may not in fact be fair or accurate to make regarding our time within death, but that it may be, or would be rather, is in itself a preference. This is why I refute further lines of relations (or sophistry), for the reality of my life is born of action, or rest, and the judgment of words heeds no experience for me. As it were, reasoning and logic hold more truth in propositions, in that they make results seem more clear. “Meaning is just that, in regards to something, that its meaning remarks the outcome of it.” And if someone were to say that the outcome of our death, or at least our time and place within nothing, would be poor, then to that I can discern. But effectively, I see little room for this point, as they are merely painting the world with words, but leaving out action, or at least the objects which are subject to the place in which their reasoning reflects. And I personally cannot see how a state of nothingness can offer anything really, and that when I think of this from my living state, I feel accurate in attesting to the lack of threats and fear, and that however little hope or ectasy there is, so will my bodies abscence reproach from this, sinking into the peaceful void instead.
            <br>&emsp;The arguments are one thing, and to them I cannot refute. But, even if I take their reasoning, which I cannot say beyond sophistic relations offers any insight as to what meaningless (and nothing) mean, all I can do is accept them as terms of reality, and evaluate them from my place within living. And having done so, I see no reason to fear; for as Buddha says, our suffering in life is generally born from ignorance, that we let ourselves get carried away with strides of gluttony and ambition, and forgo fortifying efforts to incur industry and or strength, along with the use of those dutie’s fruits.
            <br>&emsp;I will define myself as a man of privilege, for I live in a home that has grown further than middle class, and nationally and naturally, my land is one of rights and liberty. So I can see a bit further as my posture is not so worn down. Yet, I do know pain, in both the frazzled conflict that sprouts from ignorances which accompany me through this flourishing -personally or with others- and our general involvement in the acts and deeds within these richer times. And by that account, despite earning a large reward, I long ago recognized that without adhering to the tasks that earned me this bounty, that achieving them would still be a chore; moreso, would more effort neccessarily come, in maintence for instance, and of that I’d be unprepared. And again, I am coming from a fortunate state that has the luxury of struggling in an air-conditioned room, but of patience, respect, punctuality and fortitude, I am ordained to address. And having done so, I can now hold with tenderness and might, all those gifts of modernity and man. Yet, in being so astute in our receptivity, ‘as if we had forgone showing up drunk to the altar’, we are now upright with our riches, resting with them, running with them, stabily, kindly, sincerely, through which the world is able to be seen, entire, plain, clean. And by this account, I can say that the end I seek is truly one that is past these fortunes, as these are but fruits of our condition, the sentence of which is paired with my body -for be it amidst kings or serfs, my body needs food, and not even I have enough equity to pardon me from the work needed to meet the cost of bread.
            <br>&emsp;Consequently, my place as man is similar to those past, in that this body I have is a burden, for it seeks and needs, rightly to which I reply, but also shamefully to which I must obstain. Yet, I cannot say why this trouble is worthwhile, for I do not know. I can speak to the glamor and aim I have amidst our stable ways, but likely that is from a privileged position. For I genuinely understand those who were lower class, and of older times, who did not in fact have many fruits beyond surviving the day, and that such a laborous sentence did in fact lighten under the promise of an eternity following. And this offer does seem to be one that claims that such time will be like now, only without the burdens. “So that our dreams amidst war, or our intermediary pleasures following work, seem like a coming constant; that is, all that we wish for, as rooted in and born from life, is staked as our reward for making it through, the meaning of which marbles such state as having faith in heaven.”
            <br>&emsp;My point, is that in this privileged state of burden, which surpasses the muddied crags of true labors, but is inferior to the autonomous freedman (be it noble or elite), the road ahead is dear. Simply, we have a grip on our post, standing on it, seeing it with brimmness and cheer; we are not so put down as not to see, nor too free as to have no strength in our spine to stand tall enough to see. We are present, engaged, but through reason and flourishing the task is gripped in our han. “And holding that instrument the world appears all.” Through that might then, I am not convinced that we are even asking the proper question, for if our life really has meaning, so would the condition that prompted that question bar one from asking it; for has it really lifted enough for you to cease attention and ask? “Its like your in class, watching the clock to see when you can go, and as it takes a year to go two seconds, you ask the point; yet in this you have forgone the point that had you there in the first place, as you are only now asking, but from a state that was ready to go.”
            <br>&emsp;And by those accounts I hold my positions closer to our place as subjects; which is to say that in all and entirety there may be no meaning, but of the objects and bodies around, so do those natures apply. And to me, the absence of neurology and sense marks an equally comparable progression as in the case for acquiring the ability to walk, or speak, or those reflections made when you first became a man; that similar to these aspects being birthed into form then saturated, so are the products of that fairly removed as the body is segmented. And, for instance, the moral of humanity is not really an ultimate claim, as it too is a subject within entirety; but, red and blue may not be anything different in the absolute, but as far as that has come to be, theres a difference (as our labels suggest); but, even if their peculiarities are in fact identical, so can we subject them as unique, however limited our referencing is. “For what a man is, I do not know, for I know no things; yet, of things and whatever they are, there is one called man; who, despite his confidence that he is unique amongst partial things, in that his mind gives him a destiny towards that infinte space beyond the finite of things, he too forgets what, as a man, he is as a thing in that finite domain.”
            <br>&emsp;And personally, to reiterate, my positions gravitate towards the sides which say that our view of what’s outside the finite comes from our misuse as finite things. Now, even if I confess our knowledge of such far things, I still am not bothered by what they mean for this thing I am. For, the sole prompt (as I see it), for this regard of the infinite, is that it draws us, like a moth to flame, as an escape from this struggle within the finite. Yet, for me, the hand that offers itself from outside this common realm, is not one that suggests it will improve the life I have, but rather offers the means to give me what I truly seek in that life: what I would have if it were not for the load which causes the burden in the first place. “Through nothing my body thankfully goes, and thus its claim on me has no hold, and I am given peace and rest, in nothing. For only is something desired due to the body being pressed, for under freedom it would in fact move, yet our condition makes it a debt, as we must treat it. And consequently we ask and pray, that the movement our chained body wished to make could be following our release.+++++”
            <br>&emsp;My theory though, is that whatever life there is to give, comes while the body is present, and that through self regard and grace, we can make the most of it, happily even, so much as we are chained. But, as I have seen, even as those shackles are removed and we are able to run, so is rest what I seek: for when I go, I eventually stop, and am pleased to. In that state where the body has moved and its prominence is absent, so are we then of peace, for we are truly not, but happily having moved. The key element, however, is that when you are alive, that rest is a garnish to the movement you inevitably do, be it burdened or free’d. And in that life I do prefer the latter, perhaps because my movements of that kind settle into points of rest, as opposed the relief that comes from being done with what burdens you -yet only intermediately.
            <br>&emsp;Again though, this is what I am saying from this admittedly privileged point of view, but a well grasped one no less. And from here, my time with real living has given me the experience of real rest, which is to say when the body has moved and is free to do so no more. And it is in that which I find the dearest experience, as if the burden of the body -who even in the best of times still needs to move- has vanished, and I can simply, freely and peacefully be. I see no weakness in concluding that nothing would be more of the sort, as the darkest points of sleep would suggest; and as those are but the cream of the active-resting crop, so does an eternity of that appeal to me, at least as a promise or meaning through my struggle to succeed. “Which, I’d say, explains how I’ve reached this conclusion, for in that struggle to success, I’m glad, for not has been given, as my past has clearly shown that not but me can prevent our fortunes being whithered away, but so to our actual address, which is a real state of non-being, whereby we’ve let go, having already been.” And it appears to me that those who see this are those who helm what is burdened upon them, as if a neccessary response, and made forth to where their drawn, as if a positive response; for this is where rest truly comes, as your activity hasnt been of burliness and constraint, but real expression and strides, the soul of which sees one settled and complete, ‘whereby the colors of ends, have already been reached’.

            Simply put, the best thing is to consider what you have to do. At the very least, we must consider whether there are consequences when we die, because if there are, then we are most prudent to advise.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the claims that there are, be it of heaven or hell, seem to come from testimony and faith, which together feel unreliable or verified. Moreover, on a technical front whereby we use pure reason to dissolve, I feel no one has offered a well-rounded take on how everything’s come to be, at least not so much as (such theory) reflects how things (in the current) are. Nor, by any means that aren’t rooted in those histories or our emotions, is it clear how we should ‘reasonably’ oblige. Or, perhaps, if we knew the truth about things, then there’d be more room for us to orient ourselves appropriately. But as it were, we know not the outer layer and the voided enclosure, nor are we by these accounts apt in our views of the subjects within such absolute realms. In other words, our definitions of things are incomplete, for as things, we know not what they are and thus what they mean, for the roots that birth them -and as the beginning acts as part of the end- so is entirety needed to be known.
            <br>&emsp;This very question feels sufficient in offering us the treaty of reproach, whereby we humor the fact that of this ultimate question -and its varying points- that we don’t know. Nothing else has any true meaning, for no purpose or cause can be referred to. There are theories mind you, or approaches if you will, that allow for an advancement of our knowledge which is paired within both an adjustive and respectively incomplete set of actions. Still, the rump of this holds its own entirety, for even our incomplete actions need some stable end. “It only seems appropriate that with such certainty, we’d make only so far as we are sure of its extent, but privy to its limit, and thus more like a guess.”
            <br>&emsp;By those facts, we will hold truth to the realm of subjects, which is to say that we know not that there are things, for we know not what things are, but at least amongst us where subjects are held, is one called man. Just as there is red and blue in terms of subjects, so is there a creature capable of industry, reasoning, reflection and delight. Yet, he is akin to the Gods in his complexion, for he in some ways controls that which binds him, but differs though in that he is not so powerful that he can remove his chain. In effect, he must remain at his post, yet knows not fully why. And, accordingly, it seems that this very theory is the point by which his natural completion can profess, for he can at best self-reflect upon himself as the subject he is, and how within such limits he should bind.
            <br>&emsp;This, to be clear, is banked on the pure notion that besides an ultimate measure, things that appear different may in fact not be so, but warrant -in effect by those subjecting them- their distinction, or at the very least contrasting them in that they appear unique. Or, better said, that however short our knowledge goes, the identities of what appear to be separate entities can at least hold fair measures of those being separate. “The point being, that as subjects they may differ, and thus in our regard.”
            <br>&emsp;In front of this though sits our place as man, which is to say that how we would be identified, is how we ought to amend. That is indeed our furthest struggle, for despite our great wealth of both material and sense, so are there scars from our tracks behind. In this I fear that we have not reached a point worth guessing from, for we know not where but must act with the limited power we have; yet, on route to acquiring that power, we were pre-mature (and with haste) to identify what our ends were truly for. The problem, is that, for one, we were not actually at a point where rest should be taken and definitions found. Instead, the mere novelty of the wheel should have been respected, and what sense we applied in coloring the world ought to have been kept, reservedly we’ll say, for the more fairly expected advance beyond this point. For if God and his relation to men had not been rooted in until formal writing was a thing, then at least those keen to propose would likely have both humble ends, as their words could say so much more that they couldn’t help but be, but also a measure against, for others could write too, where instead, as it stands, deliberate words and language came after heresy was common. I fear then that our place as realized men is not one which can truly rest in its place, but still holds dear to its roots of salvation. “Yet, in my mind, what choice has ever been well, for lasting effects that is, when under pressure, as opposed to a state which was clear-minded and secure? For in one your running, while in the other your more curious to actual know, and thus commissioned to truly discover, while whatever relieves the former would do.”
            <br>&emsp;I must say though, personally, that this point in time where such primitive ends hold no sway, brings with it the opportunity to incite real amends. That is, the world has overburdened itself with wealth and ability, so much so that the reign of those with ancient sensibility holds no more. “For none can really prove or hold council that Jews should be killed, or HIV ceded to ignorance.” As it were though, the world is changing, but to where it does not know, for again, no end beyond that from times past has been given. And what I am saying is that we should at least act with some sort of end, even if the basis for it is limited. It’s not even a hunch that were going on, but rather a reverence for the truth born from a model which seems fair to respect, within our limits at least. Again, that portrait is one where, beyond the realms of absolute, we can appreciate and respect things as they are identified. For instance, what spice is and how it came to be, generally even, warrants me -despite lacking that knowledge- the integrity to respect that savory is different. Such tastes, or at least what we call taste, are mere properties we hold, as a fish oxygenates itself through gills and, in a granular sense, how molecules form to begin with and over finer configurations behave. We know not where ‘something’ came from, nor do its many wonderments have true models on our behalf. But, we can still deem ourselves as rational creatures, right to flee fire, and sound to use words and industry to create agriculture -that is, we remarked how the light in the sky comes and goes, and the plants with it, then tried something, from compulsion admittedly by our industrial sense, but not to dissimilar than our contrasting aversion to heat, and our equally natural response.
            <br>&emsp;With that in mind we’ve come to our most delicate part. Simply, and perhaps to a further conclusive end, are our sensible parts -or mental products rather- and whether they are in fact tapping into and receiving something, or are the outputs of matter, or tissue in our case? In other words, is there some ethereal form by which the elements of a rock come from, whereby they exist via the expression of that eternity, but peculiarly so in the essence of a rock? I would say no, or at least I wouldn’t describe the heart of this with specifics. That being so though, removes the exemption of reason and sense as being definitively ‘given’ by that eternity. If true, then there were no words in your head but the speech in which you otherwise speak, nor would the sound of a bird be any different than that ear knawing ring (or tune rather): the only difference being of the actual sound or resonance, ‘which, as it were, is held quite fairly by the evident movement of your mouth when you try and think something out, or something like that of the sort’. To be clear, the assessment of your thoughts is mightily hard, especially if it is from outside the person in question. But we need not invite explanations that fit to things which are unlabeled, for doing so makes such explanations rather poor, as they are not even pure in what they are of; moreso, if we did in fact label the subject in question, which is to say your inner thoughts, sounds and what not -your mind if you will, which your actual vision and smell don’t apply- then we’d more aptly find that neurology, acoustics and the comparison to more firmly understood hearing and speech, fits as either an explanation or, at least, grounds for illustrating the natural phenomena at play. Accordingly, if our mind is natural, there mustn’t be anything else which we hold near and dear within the realm of subjects; that is, as a rock whithers, so do we and our minds. And the point is not what we particularly do, but, more importantly, that we as subjects (and in a way all others too) rest and act as things of a material sort; or, better said, that our ‘natures’ are such that they don’t operate elusively and on whims, but by the currents of whatever reality is. And again, we know not where those roots mean for us to go, where they come from, or what they are fundamentally made of: but we do know what an apple is, and where and when it will and could fall from a tree.

        <div id="darkwaters">
            On the whole of it, our fortune and joy bear the regard. The latter though fairs a necessary conduct of self awareness and intention, while the former is more readily marked in the inherited goods already given. Still, this point of our position is one that alters by our own actions, or at least bends based on how we handle the pole. I would just simply remember that you have more than enough, and that anything aimed at improving this is ill-warranted for the purposes of either A) removing idleness, or B) advancing towards things which are both less rewarding and more challenging than you would expect. “You may cross the road to earn a favor, but not the world. For in one, the day is truly given, for your dedication was only a part of it, but if your life is bent towards the gain of something larger, then so will its offer come at the cost of an occupied vessel.” Otherwise, joy seems easy and splendid, abundant too. However, our disregard and or disheveling of fortune (and her sweeter pursuits) keeps me out of sight from other people; holding the according amount of friends is no trouble, but finding friendship, or comrades at least, is not easy in its own right -which can cause a sense of lacking. Still, we are missing only a brief amount of genuine things as compared to a world of occasions. Our path is not even void from such purer developments, but so are we on our own in approach. Perhaps the problem is that our concern for joy holds no room or stay down the paths to fortune. It’s not as if we are displeased ourself, so we ought be amiable, nor are we ignorant of what is required to earn what we plainly need, so we’re rightly stated, but of those routes which stretch beyond the norms of real living -along with the compliments which come about- that is where we lack heading. And I hold no judgment or discrimination, but such activities of relief and ambitious content, are contrary to our own use and devotion to personal growth and fecundity. “Yet the favors from such path are not had, at least on those run farther out.”
            <br>&emsp;None of this is even meagerly botherso me though. Feeling great and strong is hard to offend, nor is anything short of that worth missing out on. And otherwise, those who go that way are not worth any envy, or a receipt of contempt. “Those truly prospering would likely be more discrete and integral, evidently at least; more than that, would any goods that we’d see as worth admiring for and thus emulation be fair to address and regard, as opposed to those sparking down their road of fortune with triumph and pretense.” There is no real victory there. And like a soldier who earns the revere from his bravery, or his own pleasure in being courageous, so is this a mark for those smaller to reach, or those higher to commend. “Only that which is poor earns real envy, as in the hearts of the wicked or on the outskirts of our tranquil mind, so is it those who are crude and bare in their actions -and how much they show this- that such comparisons and contempt are drawn: while those truly good foster no jealousy.”
            <br>&emsp;Further than that, you could point out that one may doubt another based on their disbelief that such goodness is actually not present, and that the colors of vice are in fact at hand; in this case, their understandable envy is in uproar, as another’s apparent place in more admirable tidings is infuriating as the truth in the matter feels hollow, and thus the perceived vice at hand better warrants the envy that the critic has. “Why are you pretending! I know your a fool, but at least stand as so; for in my own aims, I feel a compliment to you, as our similar vows for women and prestige earn us a suitable relationship of real envy and contempt; acting like your not dressed in such ways however, warrants my respect for you, yet in the background I know your toes are dipped in those vicious waters, like I, and thus I am in conflict: for the shame I see, and know, is in we.”

        <div id="fingertips">
            Often, when I am listening to music or watching shows especially, I have this warm and full feeling. This is what I wish to experienece; and consequently, the breadth of such ways is how we are going to proceed. For in our doubts, we question how our insecurities will be filled, for how can we achieve their remissions with direct efforts towards that? Well, this is mere childs play, were already made. And in a sort, our best is in taking that whole hearted gait, and spreading it as you see fit. But this is the reward, for nothing other is truly a figure of you doing well. And the sprouting of our truest way is more akin to light blooming from a fiery source, rather than a surface being made. "For me, it seems fair that so long as we have that flame, we are well; and because nature has no fundemental claim besides the pressue which our incoerecne leaves with idleness, so are successfull already if we have that flame; for we would be doing as we should if we did not have it, and if having so, we are almost evidently fine: but so can our purpose be in breathing more air into the fire, and spreading the blaze." In other words, the shine around remarks the true reward of the center, and is not aimed at furthering that, but making what is there (already) pleased.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, our life may be reflected on, as in the case for a looming problem. For if we are in fact free and moving, then our thoughts will further reinforce that, but in an expansive way as compared to one of discpline. This is a quick but important distinction, as we are not trying to make our interests ingrained with us, but rather giving such tasks the time and care as to let their natural pace substantiated, rather than present at all. For, if we are free, then ought the things we normally do be fine enough? And if so, then we in effect need only to carve out a better path, or reflect on what would support us in activity while we proceed. This, to be clear, is a remark set within the effects of gluttony, whereby we come to a relaxed but stationary stance; and in those cases, we tend to think of what we are going to do, and further that notion with something akin to a promise, as to give us momentary relief -both by virtue of the permission to remain relaxed, but also in remedying the stationary symptom of long term frailty.
            <br>&emsp;What I have noticed, is that when our actions in fact don't come to play, that this is not a limit of the actions and our discipline to them. Instead, the situation is one where we in fact lack freedom. This is so, perhaps, in that our time is hedged elswhere, or grogged down lets say. More importantly, the norms of our lives if left unaccounted for, may rear their heads with interam conseuqneces. For example, when we were younger we would have this large stretches of great and happy time, but as it went on we found out that we had been poorly accounting for how we cumminacated with our mom and dad; in effect, we were thrown off of our stance and forced to deal with the lack of respect and adherence I was giving. In doing so however, we were able to mend that gap and secure it tightly for the future to come. In a way, these sort of issues reveal themselves as their shortcomings accrue. This is in contrast to immediate tasks such as work or health, while these are ones that come about after months, if not years. And like most things, the knot on the strand must become reinforced for it to stay without our attention. I do in fact disregard how I treat my parents for my natural bent has angled itself towards treating them well; this was not my nature though and thus practice to begin, and both an understanding and continuous reflection was required. That being said, it is clear that even the elements which are most near, may in fact be slipping, or lacking firmness and ease. Consequently, as I experience it anyway, that I may be aware of something needing my regard, but as the essence of it looses any active hold, then so does it become bundled up, whereby it resorts to pinning from some far recess in my mind. "As if I know, having accepted, but through ill attention it recedes, acting then as a orbiting weigtht, rather than one where my more capable tenants can hold." This, along with the tears from pure neglect, remark how the strands of our common lives can tangle us up and hurry us down. And as I see it, there are things at the moment which are lacking do to our current lethargy; even more though, am I noticing (as if the kind was just realized) that there is debirs in my field of orbit, which in other words means that there are aspects of my life which are not fully accounted for. And perhaps in some cases I know, but have given them little regard; and so as they become more evident, or at least like dark matter make their appearence indirectly noticible, their weight begins, for as I said the lever of my distant mind is fragile and burdensome when compared to the pipes of deliberation and reason. 
            <br>&emsp;Worth noting, is that our lack of enjoyment comes from the normal weight of the world; for even with the clearest sight, do we still have to hold. It is true though that regularity and development make things which were once a struggle, easier. Still, even if things of the past weigh us little, so is the awareness that is still required subject to the throbbings of those negging strands. And otherwise, my point is that whether there is a weight which is known, or some overlooked issue that still burns in its effects (from it being passed by), so are we in a state or not of equilibrium, which by my account yeilds us an experience surrounding that levered support. That is to say, that whether we are burdened by our tasks -due to its weight and our lackings, or its unknown but felt effects- or are floating with nearly any effort, so are we living outside this. In other words, life pressures us, be it immediately or of those looming things in orbit, but so are we with activity and response if the trouble is gone. Whether were relaxing or in some self directed activity, were alive. And the point, is that seeing as the mightiest reward is akin to the latter, reaching its height through flavor, regularity and ease, so is the limit of this based on those weighing forces. For instance, if we have no danger holding our attention, then our gazing nature will turn to the sun and stars. And so does this become easier when we do it more often, for we may see more than we had before, and newly as well. Disregarding this aim though, let us simply accept our shortcomings within it are due to issues within those groundfloor tasks. Now, much of this is out of control, as nature needs us to be either resourcefull or co-operative in acquiring food and shelter. But still, even if this is easily come by, so are many elements possibly being overlooked. This is why I bring up those orbiting pieces of debris; for we know that if we miss work that there will be trouble, and that even though it is work in being employed, that constant use of that task will render it more simple, wherein the effect is at least an increase in our ability to experience that fuller aim. Yet, we may be unaware of draining interest from unacknowledged debts. Again, someone who is truly misfortuned may not be able to make a profit, or a comparabily high one as those who simply work a part time job; but at least in these cases the struggles are upfront and in hand, which to reiterate places the burden with our most capable aspects. I would still make note, that the relationship one has with their parents ontop of their more rural fortunes, is still in effect a debt; for even if one is bracing the force of those downward troubles, so is the inflammation regarding their family an ostensible thorn in their side. For, the point perhaps overall is that even in our richest ways, we are still in doubt; for locally, we as a culture are still young when it comes to our views of truly profitable duty and health, while even those pure in those respects, may be poor in their assortment of words, which is to say that despite their locally sound assembly, that rought shores swirl ahead (and around), or that toxins have spilled in some outflow far away, and are rotting the nearby soil from deep below. And to me, the aim of saint like riches is unachievable while this is happening. For just as it is hard to pay of a credit card while the interest is so, so is it hard to be at the top when the graspable struggles have cracks seizing you from behind. 
            <br>&emsp;And in short, that little kid in India who runs around in the rubble and mud, is not just absent from the privilages of a comforting time, but so are they over the course of months and years suceptible to the same woes which even the wealthiest are subject to in their own stable time. It is true, in a way, that in lower classes that people are perhaps less vain, and in a general sense operate with more regard (or attention at least) to their family. And in that sense, the pair of humility and communal kindness can in fact afford one a lower burn rate, in contrast say to those of a higher but realtivelty ignorant class when it comes to those deeper strands of our common lives. Better said, those in less fortuned scenarios deal with the struggle of getting bread and bed, but by their ordinary and unfutile characters remove, or at least contain little debris around them; while, in summary, those in chambers of gold and glorious red, may in fact have snakes in the garden, or even skeletons in their closet. "For is that not the case for all of Man, that what truly matters, be it near and dear or passively orbiting, if poorly treated will accumulate, like a debt, and cause such a decrease in our living."
            <br>&emsp;I stand personally then, as one without anything less than privilage, but a rot if you will, in all those unaccounted things around melting away my sides. I must suggest however, that just as skills for a house league are little, so are those of the highest kind neccessary of an equal calibre. And in my case, that rich experience of reliance and direction, promulgation and serenity, comes only when my makeup is pure. Weidly enough, I am noticing things which have always been there, only now when feeling good is a given by effect of attending to certain things, are those missing elements which hold greatness from being equally so more prominent and clear, 'like debris orbiting around me which held little regard in comparison to the nearer storms around'. And in a way, to conclude, Plutarch is right in his remarks, where he suggests, 'that those in the field of sculpting (with clay) have the hardest job when fingertips are involved'.

            We require nothing for this common life. True, we could see more of it if we had success, but such ends require their own heft of efforts. “And our delights found in liberty, require an equal amount for themselves.” Admittedly there is stuff I’d like to do, but our interest in doing roots itself in the fear of missing out, or at least the chance that a more thrilling life could be acquired. “That’s what seeing all these people with their accolades and plaques does to me; why aren’t we with such claims, or better yet why is our road not down that path?” For a good life, all it takes is regality and true regard. For that, the world we have is enough, and your home bears that mark.
            <br>&emsp;A stronger way of describing this, is that our flourishing reflects the warmth around our localle; while success remarks the expansion of the latter. This is unrequired, as it is the movement of the former which is really desired. Moreover, can it be experienced wherever you are. Conclusively then, we will not heed contempt or feel ashamed, or be rightfully driven or yearning for a life which is growing, thrilling, glorious or acclaimed -in an outward direction that is. These require so much more than our good life is willing to barter, as it too demands that we throw ourselves in; the difference being one of conquest and play. “Its as if we held an telescope, looked at the stars and chartered our findings, settled on them, looked forward to future findings, and all about our ordinary claim, while the other marks a plan, a vision, some preview, as if we’re going somewhere, better mind you, with all the praise and profession as our dreams defined. This is ill-founded, unnecessary, keenly placed, and worth no contrary amount of shame.”

            Something I’ve always known is that everyone lives their own respective lives. And because mine is different, I feel under threat.
            <br>&emsp;This is so, primarily, because our aims are different, as are our thoughts on what should be worked for, or not even. Through such bends, the angle of others sheens against mine; for when their telling stories about their fruits and promise, I fear a suggestion coming towards me. This is so for I would have to explain why I was uninterested, even if the venture was strong. For as I see it, reproach is not a measure of interest, but priority rather. Of course I’d like to be the King of England, and of course I’d like to take that trip, but in and of itself I am less intrigued than I am to read, or write, study and run. Better yet, if there were good in those fortunes, it would be so those latter had a nicer area to partake in; yet, this would be a fortune indeed, as it were likely given; whereas the privilege’s that are acquired, however scrumptious in their lining, heed no short amount of difficulty in their acquisition. “And I take the lane which holds what’s near and dear: that is primary.”
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps we are trying to have our cake and eat it to. It may be true that others, in all their differences, and possibly unfriendly from them, see my own differences not as poor, but without room for contradiction. For I cannot live so simply but ask for something. Nor can I refrain from the linens of what’s common, yet still expect someone to stand by me. This is the struggle though, for however well you shine, your still Atlas holding the ball. Others may warm you, and you may warm them, but always in a moving state. “For I will not be theirs, nor will they be mine.” And the truth in that is what is hard for me to be, and as such is where there’s friction in what would set me free. For we are not looking for benefits here when in fact there would be shortcomings there; but rather we are looking for strength and fruitfulness from ourself, be it alone, with others or an attractive kind -as in those brought to your shine and aid. ///////
            <br>&emsp;Where I struggle is in telling someone that they care, but that they will never be mine; so love is all they’ll receive, but no proceeds towards their position to greet it. Nor will I be theirs, by which our own efforts see no need to append, for their stake is not one being asked for. Its strange isn’t it, to an end which holds no par for possibility. For the gains we seek are in need of prioritization; yet, wisdom can define, and with this context in mind, I only mean to say that love is all I seek, in treatment and receipts. But under no impression am I to believe that some other will be mine, nor I theirs. “For what life is, is better rustic in the fullest state, as compared to a line which brings you together, but hollow. ”

            Since we will always be moving, concern for fortune outside of this regard seems unimportant. And as it were, our life will more or less be contained within a constant set of rungs, those being the nature of our limit, the position of self regard, family and friends, and our true reward flowering from this -of leisure and industry that is. If we are alive, so will these elements be tightly knit together. Considering our need to move, our liberality will be deemed so if such movements are able to proceed unhindered. Fortune, to be clear, is that which removes our stakes, or at least we temper the flame behind us (which makes us move, and in accordance tailors our actions to have ends). This is not worth removing from your life, but threat of its remission are not truly worth humoring; for, as we said, even in chains we can hold our self with divine regard; and seeing as our country is one of humanity and law, so are our ordinary ways protected from all but our own villany in being persecuted. Stealing in a plagarized sense is not too uncommon, nor is there any abscence of dogmatic scrutiny or harm; but so are we able to be kind, and in a practical sense angle ourselves to future times and current places which are in fact relevant to us: as opposed to those public fantasies -where such critques linger. Our life only needs to put out there, but this is merely local, and at best attractive to those who would then share in establishing community. This is our lane though, of which others may care, as I do. “Manchester won, and I was the player who scored; but me and the fans were equally set and ordained to the team winning.” So those who care about gaming, literature, film and the world, will be comrades of mine through interest, and I to them -no matter who is the one running the play.
            <br>&emsp;In sincerity, the only downfall of our living times, is that if we have come from activities and their effects born through complacency and foolish ignorance, then our return to a better state will see us falling forward, as if the tears from the prior efforts made us lose our grace. In effect, our uprigthness is too stiff and we either settle into the disposition of those vicous things -whereby we are nothing- or we (as mentioned) return to a better state, of action, but carry the weight of vice’s baggage. Thus, stiffness is brought to our actions, despite their sincere attempt. Disposition though can iron this out, as can principle act as a firm molder of such transition. #####Instead of saying that commitment is required as to stay down this better lane, we can simply rest on the notice we have of action’s precedent, which is to say that we will always be doing so, and thus removing concern for fortune -as our liberty is all we need- or interest for relaxtion -for it is a monstrous alternative to rest, as one is fully stopped, while the other is merely slowed down.

        <div id="oldscars">
            In times of doubt or contrition, affirming your course is key. For, I do wish to be on the same page as those around me, for the weight placed on me ceases somewhat, as the stakes at least are not so much. For now, I see that we are asked very little, not understood to be doing something of any contrary way, and that the sole limit is actually our aim of action. In that, we should define.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, I seek community, production, friendship, and care. This though, is a mark of our innate humanity, for if we were able to flourish on our own, then such an experience would be no less hospitable. None the less, the demands of me, or at least the constancy of our regard, entrenches a desire for things which relieve it, or allow us to respond no less. In that sense, the purpose of our survival is one that makes such efforts meaningful, for even in this modern time where failure is all but absent, so are we kept at that post, meandering: and purpose, or liberty rather, makes such stilled yet fortuned positions fulfilling.
            <br>&emsp;I will admit that in these troubled ways, or at least in our past when such weights were not held with the vigor and skill we have currently, I dreamt of both the remission or succession of misfortune, or duty rather. This, again, is not so much a crucial error; but, the saturation of it now, at least as it reflects the stain made by those prior whims, leaves our current clarity with a bit of loopy colors. However, as I will in summary denote, is that due to such muffledness, some affirmativeness of what is good is needed. For in doing so, as has been, the nievety washes away and its longing recedes, while the grip of what is solid and sound furthers with a purifying grace, whereby our past is sweetly incorporated, the present is stout, and the future is richened and light in its anticipation and austerity.
            <br>&emsp;We simply have much to say. Regarding the old world and new, its contents both crafty and great, and our views, or at least pleasures born for expression, all together segmented by pieces but of a wholesome bloom. The means to share, or connect we’ll say, is open and free; moreso, does the language used in such medium reflect that piece like interest of treatnent. And although I care not how much I am heralded or appraised, the production of fitting things, or respect for the tailored design of the medium, is of and through the kind of work we do itself. “For example, if I saw the moon and wished to write a set of verse, then posting it to a foreign platform without adapting the initial language to be suitably fitted would be an empty pursuit. Whereas, in Youtube’s case, there are thumbnails, or image headers we’ll say, and ignoring this is a contrary move to the videos in question; yet, of what thumbnail I do, that can itself be a mark of the work itself, as my otherwise primary effort is in tributing the content through writing: so can my subject then be reflected in the header.” Knowledge then of what is right and wrong in sharing, is of the form it takes, which, in short, is best summarized by spreading a message while adjusting the language its expressed in. Plus, all of this is centered on the fact, though I must admitt a frankness to our limit, that from me there is this communal push, or religious sentiment of sharing original views on things, or at least pointing out things which others do not see. “In this outward aim though, sits a man already at peace with himself. And perhaps, at most, his motions outside, are mere responses to the natural shifting of his place in the world: whereby he holds the sun in sight, with the world on his shoulders; and his move to include others, is but a normal activity of the man in question.”
            <br>&emsp;That, is all I see, and I rest within those norms as not to guarantee or malign our wish to be received moving forward; but we can perform our natural bounds, as we would in speaking politely while out in public, so could the basic gesture of sharing our name compare to the generous portions born of our hand. “For my name, is a marker of someone and thus what they do; for they who perfomed that action, so is there name a link to that; but whereas you may admitt your name upon being seen in motion, so can the presumed assembly of you bear a less assumed action; that is, we know not what our name would be, but through it we identify the person who has achieved the evidence of an action had; while otherwise, we know that all men -who we can see as the they appear- have all of a mind, heart, feet and hands, yet to where or how they go, we do not know: and the fruits of intelligence are not in need of an uncovering because those around us could not, and do not already know that we have the tools and means to do so: but rather, unlike artists and officials, our outputs are of words and ideas, whos sprouting is but an invincibly thin sheathe, home to the cheeriest of air.” And like a new game, the rules must be given; and so too in this morphing array of wisdom’s contents, so must we be able to describe what it is that one might be seeing.

            The winds of winter are coming, yet of their coolness I am ready to be pleased. For once in our life, we are no longer cyclical; that is, the cold months are no end, in that they’d approach the beginning reach of spring onto summer; but rather, this year’s end leads into next years beginning, but so are they only subequent months. There is no reset.
            <br>&emsp;I have noticed that as we string along though, or at least when our sleep and lack of profession unsettle me to see how others are moving, or going somewhere at least, we see that we are not. It is true that philosophy offers a true spark for optimism, as all is treated well, be it through fortitude or gratitude, yet when our mind is dull or our bodies are poor, neither the excitement for what we’d see is quite clear or known, or the actual anticipation of our life moving down that way. “For what else might we see, or become?”
            <br>&emsp;It seems we have reached a starting point for real living, one of which has real footing on the bedrock of maturity. As I noticed prior to this though, the harshest truths reveal their wares when errors are made. “As if our executive nature revealed more strict consequences from our errors.” These are merely trimmings, and admittedly sometimes roots, of previous feelings and thoughts regarding the world (and its people) that arise within our life, as their seriousness draws comparably severe criticism. That is, as our life becomes more consuming, so do its slips reveal more serious cracks. “Why hasnt this been given regard, or when you were pre-occupied and feeling self important, the perceived movement of others did not bother you?” Now, when our view of things hasnt flattened into a normalized view by which others either vainly or to their righteous end run, so are we rocked by our lack of movement. Or in other words, others appear to be moving because we have not seen what real movement is. As it were, our yearning for home and wonder, makes others appear as if they have, and we feel inferior. As we shed that longing nature and instill more forward and steady steps, so do others appear less so, for their lack of such footing has no envy or insecurity to latch onto, or any hidden truth to its frailty; morover, their proper advance -in which they’d truly benefit- is agreeable to me. Perhaps the example of one who is frustrated with themselves and thus becomes irritated at others flawed success, warrants relevance.
            <br>&emsp;What we are trying to remove is this feeling that we are still, and by virtue of others lauded progress and or movement, that we are wrong to be in our current state, and should thus proceed. Normally, our happiness in being still yet engaged recognizes any of the criticsim; but when we make mistakes, or are even fully worked, we notice and or feel shame and contempt for not moving. One thing to point out, is that our preferred and or ready state is not banked towards or set for novel gains or occupation. In that sense, our sincere state of activity cares not that such ends are lacking, and as such warrants no scolding if their abscence is so. What is most important is that our personal route can be proceeded upon with absolute regard for it as a path; as opposed to worrying (and receiving judgment) that it is deeply wrong, the actual success of the way itself is whats to be regarded. As it were, the right path is determined by reason, which finds itself bringing universal qualities and our personal nature together. Simply, the ends of any path are such that ease of access, regularity and flavor determine its worth. Per our case, our lives are situated around death, friendship, self regard and wonder, to which a respect for that and our treatment from it, will heavily lean us towards the ends and preference of well being, as compared to ends which are baked within being well off. “For what King would not be declared the best, if he werent the happiest and freest, by which we mean that restless fears and spite combined with sulking pleasure and unconstant joy, were more often than not absent: whereby we’d stamp the heart of his reign.”

        <div id="fruitsoffreedom">
            Life is a little strange now adays. As it stands, we are no longer trying to acquire anything; that is, our efforts and or creations are not bent or regarded on anything they may or may not acquire. So, our own concerns are placed on the things themselves, ‘as if joy and the pace of our day was actually the measure’. By that token, our considerations are bent towards what we are actually going to do. Whats weird though is that our intent is not reflective of going somewhere. Rather, the extent to which the work is completed holds our regard. In that sense, our reflections about our time bear no credible concern on ‘where were going’, as if by them (meaning our action) that somewhere we should go -or be so as a return. Instead, the work is beholdened itself, be it through writing and industry, film and other leisure, or our own training and fitness. The question simply is how these are being attended to, and wherein ‘they’ will go -as compared to our fortune.
            <br>&emsp;You see our life is fine being ordinary, for having anything more earns one nothing if the elements rooted in the former are untended to. At any rate we are trying to live great lives, but this is not about a change in scenery or fashion, but how we actually spend our time. In a word, our liberal activities are those that come from such freedom, whereby the difference is that these are activities which we throw ourselves into, while those others are about reaching some place or bit of scenery that does everything for you. And to reiterate, bolder and or more substantial claims of official and or public workings, serve only to fixate one, and likely from an unsturdy ground. “Merely worry about yourself, your friends, your family, and tell me if your constance there reveals any need or suitable value in ruling the world, or serving a king?”
            <br>&emsp;These greens are from being ourselves, which is both necessary in either liberality or ambition, but so is that former fine and plenty when such conditions are met. And, perhaps, the most important strand of philosophy is that such fruits of freedom (liberty) are in no short order of needed attention, for they may require skills or formation themselves and otherwise neccessarily call on you to particpate: for happily, that is the reason for their worth to begin, for you can pleasingly act. And so in a forward sense, I am free to live meagerly and fine, while flourishing via that liberal load. Our growth here will be at most gradual, and any of its impact and status will result from our natural presence (of constancy in the front and back of these things), to which our brightness will iteratively grow. “And the mark of a man is in being fine with that.”

            I don’t think I’d ever want a friend, at least I wouldn’t seek one that wasn’t into me. That is so because my interests are of a peculiar sort. I sit on the floor, and sleep there too mind you; I care little for excursions, nor do I regard occasions as pleasing. I text little, chat not, and my time elsewhere is either creative and leisurely indoors, or actively flaunting or gazing outdoors. There is room for nothing other. It is true that this life holds the according prompts of lacking people, but as I’ve found you can be a steady friend to yourself. This is a quaint idea, but isn’t most of our time so already? When you sleep, as you wake, while your fiddling with something, bathing, taking care of your self, or reading for instance. And I find that it is only when these things come poorly together that I seek something more, as if my time hadn’t been good till this point and something exciting was further sought. In fact, I shed off ancillary efforts and engage in those as I am either deemed, or those which are sought. And in doing so, the floor beneath me feels sturdy enough, for in my activity I am really engaged, and otherwise happy to strengthen. And so by those accounts I am never alone nor lacking warmth, even in what would otherwise be overlooked as fortune. For I have the company of my Mom and Dad, am on the beach of life with all people and or our community, as am I entrenched in the personal writings and letters of old, who like Christ and God give me a cheerful friend.
            <br>&emsp;By my accounts a friend would deplete this, at least as I think about having one I think of all the contrary currents to those which I have mentioned. What is natural need not be coined as it comes together with near passivity. But in terms of what I can address and thus amend to, it is not the warmth of another, but the flame we have inside. For in that, it is a bonfire, tended by me and used in our activity. While the heat from others seems somewhat smaller, over time at least - through the day especially, depsite its deeper moments. Because my aim is to move, I need a lasting resonance, rather than a stilled pace furnished by bright spots. “And only those fitting and in line with that could be a friend for me: otherwise, I am fine with the one I have in myself, for in it, our flame is raised.”

        <div id="compromisingcreativity">
            A simple fact is that most things require little. We may have to work more than we’d like to achieve them, or are otherwise limited in the extent of which our actions could acquire, but stability through adjustment will occur. As it were, I could take 6 months of relatively inexpensive training to become an instructor or worker of sorts; this would increase our rate of income, and likely the form of it -an alternative at least.
            <br>&emsp;Unpacking this though, I have other interests and priorities. In effect, I have both no time to committ to learning something other, nor do I wish to partake in its tasks at the expense of our own work. Labor affords this, as the time is comparably sparse and non mental; moreso does it contribute some vigor (and means to rest). Working as a programmer on the other hand, is similar in work as my own, and I mean not to compromise -at least I recognize there is one. Moreover, the real gems of that pursuit take more than early developments; those permit an increase in income, but not neccessarily the dynamics of work that you’d seek. However short, there is surely more time required for that novel aim (of mobility and self living) to be met: and currently I have not the time nor interest to foster that.
            <br>&emsp;That being said, if I were, for argument’s sake, finished with our creative work, then our means for allocation could be directed to some other pursuit. Whether I’d want this or not is unclear, but not worth regarding. If I am rightfully happy, then things clear out. Only, right now, I do wish for more footing in the land around; but acquiring so within deliberate means, is both too demanding and, admittedly, undesired enough by me in this moment, to slice off some of our dearest effort’s attention.
            <br>&emsp;I say this for I believe that down this line we will be happy. For me it is worth anticipating the fact that to meet our needs, we’d do little. Even if circumstance has us doing a bit more, so does the nature of the job apply, for if it is just a bit more effort but of a supporting kind (of our creativity that is), then so be it. I fret not that this will change or that via lifes coming course, that we cannot discount our time without consequence. The future beyond this interests me too little; and the present possibilities are such, that they are worse if we have to work at all: but the merrits are still fine, and stabilitiy can more or less increase in the ease by which its achieved. Personally then, I feel as though our regard is set, and that we can rest on our actual activity, and accept where were obliged, and waiver not on whether or not we will or will not recieve. Let the road which scares me little, come as it be; for in our proceed, we are already made -which holds nothing more than the mantle below.
        </div>
        <div id="windingaims">
            I know, however small, that clearcut effort will always win the day. What is interesting though, is that when you reach a sincere point of adulthood, you earn less reward, or value in other words, for simply showing up. Better said, your results and the actions which afford them are what mark you actually being fufilled and content. For in your adolescent days -which we’ll describe as those where trying was the game- our idea of the good was less formed, and thus we had a shorter bar to cover before completion was reached. And because our standards were evidently low, so could we reach them with more whimsy and gusto, whereby the care and regard for being as so, settled as the valued element.
            <br>&emsp;Now, on the other hand, our interest is one of true and constant success, and as such calls on us to be more than merely well intended, but actually efficient. Another way of looking at it is that ends call on both an aim (or intent) and a target (ie. as a magnifier for precision); and in effect, our accuracy in reaching forward will be as much as such paths are met. The thing is, that upon our adulthood those routes (and their corresponding course) became set within lanes of real and lasting substance; whereas in our developing years, the mere sheathe of greatness was enough to remedy our day: while in our fully formed state, that quality is equal through both flesh and the bone -or activity rather, as opposed to mere attempts.

        <div id="engenderedpost">
            So there are two things that come to mind when I am thinking about my life. First, is what will fulfill you, in that it seems important, substantial or meaningful. Second, is what soothes your core; or in other words, what do you like, enjoy, commend, emulate, rest with, accept or wish to routinely do? These two sentiments of our place in life and what strikes our heart, mark our path of refinement.
            <br>&emsp;Of note, is that I seek some fidelity in this thought. For positions and or destinations may seem attractive, but after thinking on it and what it would actually mean, I realize that such (or at least most) things of this kind fair little once the moment is done. Or, better said, that the reason I strive for such ends, or at least why I am choosing them right now, is that they stand as things appropriate for the caseOur lacking, idle intent. Yet, in my mind, which I must admit has been reflected on greatly, there’s little care or intrigue to things that, upon definition, come out as mere occasions or frivolity. “In short, I wish not to bank my life or time on novelty.”
            <br>&emsp;So what does seem important? Well, helping the world sticks out, or offering any kind of service for that matter. Education, entertainment, civilities, etc., come to mind, as do inventions and theories which profess to improve our lives. Here though a core thread wriggles its truthful head, in that all of these things, whose aims I think across the board we share, appear to me, or at least have as this little thread has poked its way into my life over the years, that saving the world, being a hero, discovering things or merely becoming profound, is really a reflection of our otherwise idle aimlessness, and that as these things appear much larger than ourselves, so do our objective seeking minds attend. Yet, the truth in these is in no ways evident; that is, when it comes to our purpose in all of this, rather than the actual merrit or claim of the world being saved or an invention brought forth. Who says these are what your meant to or interested in doing? From my experience, there is an apparent lack of self-regard and reflection, which is to say that we already have a purpose at hand; it is not out there in the world or under the spotlight, but local to what we’ve known our entire lives; friends, family, leisure, death, there’s already a slew of things that deserve more candid and effective attention.
            <br>&emsp;So, asking whether you should make an impact, forge a path for a family, explore distant lands or introduce reverred papers, pings you as unjust, for what maintenance can you afford to those deeds which are already provided; better yet, which of those deeds have you even tailored to an effortless prosperity? For if there is room to go, why not address it: won’t their be purpose in that? We already find -and in some ways feel- that being married, employed and a parent will give purpose to our lives, but consider why and that this is so because they are obligations which seem worthwhile to attend; but do you not have those already, ignored or merely neglected? When have there been words on your mind until this time, when you even asked what we already have to do? “As a citizen even or person of the world, is there not even worth in being decent and sincere, as to look highly of others and, at the very least, not be put off by their inferiorities or irritations? Who do you know who is so pleasently arranged around all people; or are they always shouting criticisms and miserries, as if their misfortuned to be subject to such stupidity? Has this person really upheld their post, as a person, or have they let themselves go in a way, as reflected in their quick-tempered negativity and pessimism?” Better yet, don’t those people just know it all? “Let me tell you,” they’ll say!
            <br>&emsp;So, personally, I find my purpose, or place rather, is in virtue. For our limits as man and death via our mortality, surrounds me and, as it appears, bounds through all. So just by that am I subject to a deed of importance wherever I go. Moreso, be it in close quarters and the needed conduct, or when I am off and about and must be faithful (and considerate), does my family, friends and home need my stead -at least I should remember them, and keep my far-off actions in line.. Even so, in that active wake, must I helm myself, for even if some place is new or some opportunity large, a lack of self-regard or integrity will see that both it and or my use of it whither away. “So not even the furthest resorts and wonders could hold my drunken head, nor could they shine enough to pierce my ignorant heart.”
            <br>&emsp;In short, where I am, where I go, till all my time is up and through the steps between, I must be, fully, dearly, clear. For if I am not, then all things contrary to what I seek will happen; nor, will my actual quest for meaning elsewhere yield me the room I seek to go. “For currently, my post is arranged. And, as it were, as we leave such for another, the debt beneath feels more like chains.” Hence “take me oh yonder, for in this life of misery I seek salvation. All this weight, it tears behind me, and for what I do not know.” It is because you forgot to address it in the first place; and whether on the grander scale or a stormy night, you left your post, ceded, spilled momentum. Moreso, your pleas of that which reflects the highest that divinity could sign, already held you in regards: and what I find strange is that in your hopes you noticed, yet held nothing but pittle in your active wake. “As if death were what grieved you, so you sought a favor, yet, such apprehension is born from your disregard for the place of death which was already there.”
            <br>&emsp;No matter, this is about me, and in their case I understand, while in mine I am at least aware that it is I who doesn’t know -or needs clarity at least. Which, as it stands, marks my ultimate denotion as being set for death, but in a way that I must reach it: as opposed to those who seek removal. “In other words, I submit myself to it as the highest place, or rather, that it is merely a step of enrollment no different (besides being further) than that of our near lives -in family, leisure and friends- or our active ones, in that we’d saturate ourselves through self-regard, rather than sloth and stupidity.” And the most important note, as I get it, is that I am without need -as virtue has disposed me to this- or mistaken that I can ask and or devolve a plan to oust myself from this path, and in other words, that I should or, ultimatley, can, go to another place. “For the one which holds things between it and all, bears no realm to be somewhere other; for now is when I have the time to be, for it is our being that we are so within the place for being; where we then go I do not know, but surely somewhere more absent.”
            <br>&emsp;And so I’ll surrender, as to not want more and through that hopefully receive, and otherwise use the fruits of virtue as positive enforcements to guard against our lack. Nor, will I be ignorant or inconstant through our living time, as doing so would only leave the world heated and in flames; so much so, that what guides me and buries itself in, is not the common parts of life which we are engendered to treat, but passions, fear and lust, which drench our faculties of desire, aversion and interest. Hereby, the otherwise calm and enrichening pace which a solid life brings, will be drought with sulking, putrid, capsizing colors. “Ones which will only make it hard to retreat into our actual selves and accept what our responsibilities and reverence can offer.” Instead, we’ll be on our toes, as if being chased by a fire, but really its just the pain and inflammation from being unable to sit and rest. “In other words, the sparks of restlessness drive us into the mouths of true danger; and otherwise, cede us from resting by the warming flames of virtue and her retreat.”

            The simplest definition may be, that character molds our actions, and from that, there comes a lot of reproach. For stealing, frivolity and tradition, hold little regard for someone who is disposed to real goods. But, in that, there may not be so much for you to do, as your aversions outweigh the interests of others.
            <br>&emsp;What I have learned though in my adolescent age, is that what you care for (in a character’d way) needs no shield or explanation to be amidst those of other sorts. You don’t have to change. And although your interest may simply hold you somewhere, private even, it doesn’t mean that others need be avoided.
            <br>&emsp;Then there is this point about seeing great things and struggling to express so amidst those more common. This in a way is the heart of an artist, in that they see the world differently, but cannot express it so clearly, so they paint, write, sing or dance, and in that way solidify their view. What I’ve learned though, is that the purpose of art, albeit liable for inspiration, is not there to improve other’s lives. This is an insecure conjuring, for it gives you control over others in terms of what your doing. For if you see them as not so well, than your grand offerings will shine for them, and make you appear more acceptable, as they are now on board. “All while you really just wanted to fit in, or at least have your view understood -as not to have it unclear and weighing down on you.”
            <br>&emsp;The question then, is what ought you do. For, if there are problems or interests you have, then so will your actions define. But otherwise, you are free and set to do as you please, which again, is not a problem in itself. But, if your missing someone, or bored even because your work is done, then there are places you can go. Yoga or meditation classes, eastern temples, outdoor yoga and gatherings or meetups of sorts. Be reliable in your resourcefulness, and your wish to paint the world as you wish, will have more warmth and support around, and not be so pressed to do so. For the aim of such coloring is in the contentment of your soul, from completing it, signing your way. It is not for the sake of acquiring, or overcoming the suitability to even see so -in that your admitted. This comes from the fact that when your tired and what not, something to do and or the care from people, is wanted. At least you can identify their effects as so. And, if we feel insecure because our sight is different and or large, then that separation causes whimsy, self-importance, shame and reductions. “Just go outside, and try.”

        <div id="theagingpast">
            It seems that the past has transitioned into what seemed so recent. Prior, it felt like our childhood was what sat beneath us: now it is our route to becoming a man, which itself means we are in the process of blossoming as one, as if the frame we tried to build is now calibrated and set for completion: yet, all that effort, which itself came from our younger years, is behind us: and, personally, at least, I see how little this has been incorporated, nor, admittedly, sat upon a fully solid base (of our youth).
            <br>&emsp;It saddens me somewhat that so much has gone on, and that through that, so much is glaringly distant. I just don’t think we entirely know who I am, and thus what I have received, and moreso. The past is catching up to me; and our aims ahead and treats on the horizon, beckon under their unfitted end. And so all that which I now see besides me, feels more apparent in its lack, for we are with not.
            <div class="qu">There is no problem, merely work required. For again, the recent memory is that where we once thought we stood, and it must be taken back, as to solidify the present and that to come. This will remedy any fleeting sense of loss or failure, which has admitteldy been brought on through the longing which comes from that unfettered past</div>
            We were a boy once, and of what kind I don’t exactly know. All I can say was that I was happy, at least things were well along with I. As I grew though, circumstances changed, and what I felt was most dear separated from me; and this alongside with the narrowing freedoms I had, left me more satisfied with biding our time with those: but little life glowed around this. Due to a lack of constance and internal width, the ‘radiation’ so to speak that was meager on the outside, left our life in a state of implosion. I did not seek though what would yield me strength based on where I was going, but who I was rather, which in a way brought stability from the inside, and thus established support from the outside -as I could dance with a it a little more, or address it at least, gathering its shine.
            <br>&emsp;Neverthless, we have come from there, whereby the achievement of retirement was one, ‘for I had everything I needed, regularly’: and the question then was what I would do in that free time. Down this path I’ve come, and the refinement of those treats is now the measure of our frame. As if I were liberated from toil, clarified in our objectives born from freedom, and set for that manifestation. That will be a secure completion, upon which I will offer myself to another, or something at least, meaning I will then give, as I have completed who I am: where in fact, I can give from that mark to such other -a boy perhaps, named Tom- and help them reach the same. Only, in my personal case, this hope, or condition at least, can lead them down this path with immediacy. Whereas I had to reproach from the norms of responsibility, which in themselves reflected a farther point to acquire freedom, I will provide the currents that allow this to happen much earlier, thus allowing for a sooner point of blossoming. And they may hopefully have less rot and knots beneath; which in effect, would nicely sort them into their own offerings from completion, and the refining legacy continues. “We are the first though, perhaps in the true class of man. But I need only be honest, whether in comparison -as to remove faults and winding desires- or with myself, so I can see and cheer at my spot, as I am, how its come so, and whereto and which end.”
            <br>&emsp;The largest spot of remission comes from not being who I am now in that past. Understanding this is so from that origin of reproach. Still, we are in the present, free, honest and open, but not yet having made connection, or much progress for instance. However, I think that despite the warmth that such things bring, it is moreso the fear that was present while these things were around, that leaves us scarred. Whereas now we are keen to move and speak forward, we were not so prior; things of interest would pass us by and we were hesitant, as we were uncomfortable showing who we are. “Having reproach is hard like that, for none really experience the fruits that come from her, or freedom rather. Instead, their more familiar with the treats of relief, or those which marble their advance, as softeners or motivations.” At any rate I felt avoided, or at least separated; this held a cynical mold over me, as I condemned them for our differences; or I felt frustration and shame, as if they were unaware of me, yet did not know why (or, rather, why I was different). That is what deflates me: not our lacking, but being known, understood, aware of. “The separation I feel from these connections is more akin to being passed over in a pick, as opposed to being picked last: out of the game if you will.” And simply, we have been off that road for a long time.
            <br>&emsp;That idea, of reproach, is perhaps my core feature. For you see, without problems much can be known, and our shackles which regard the former, are much lower than anyone shows. Imagine, if you had a free bed and bread in your belly: could you not survive, would this not be relatively fine? What is the need for a large home, or a vehicle when you consider how those meager needs are acquired? College even, a career in general, we are glued, or ordained towards some precise spot, a post, acting (or listening) as if we must specialize, prioritize and commission our time and objective: for what though, I do not know really. I tend to remove family, or children at least in these regards, for they are not essentially different, and thus what you care for and need, is what you must also foster and provide. Even then, people generally have children together, and considering the efficiency of splitting the pay for what amounts to the same, leaves room for another. “My half plus your half covers the whole. However, instead of having my other half left over, and yours, this is spent on a third member. Being even though, or just covered, seems alright when family is the reward, and of a simply free kind .”
            <br>&emsp;Now I understand the motivation to achieve this scenario with more efficeincy, with more breadth even. But we mustn’t confuse what is comfortable with what is truly worth desiring; for in my mind, we’ve put our foot before the shoe; and reproach is that reasonable attempt to fit them together. Again, were talking about needs, and the mistake we make is working for additions to the needs we have. This is so for we may in fact think the worth is solid, or, in a great deal of ways, we use these accessories as refinements, which, in other words, makes our means more acceptable and pleasing. This is fine, but let’s say for instance, we did agree that a roof and bread was all we needed. It seems preferable that we’d acquire this through flavorable and lighter ends, compared to those which are rough and tasteless. The mightiest of points though, is that getting what we need, which we’ll say is the limit for peace and contentment, is not itself the aim, or objective rather. I cannot describe this so fully, as I have not reflected clearly on the terms; but with some ignorance mind you, I can forwardly say that it is what comes from such freedoms which measures our worth; or, rather, what we are drawn towards and able to oblige in our peace and freedom, is what such things are for.
            <br>&emsp;And so, if you work well to acquire what you need, then your peace should be itself comfortably acquired: but how, with such rest, are you expressing yourself, or living from those free grounds? However you are, this is the ground for liberty, the fruits of freedom. Instead of describing what you might see if such freedom was acquired, let us, as a basic, remove our own ignorance in thinking either A) that more is required for freedom to be achieved, and that B) if we have it(freedom),the efforts for what it provides are in need of energy and focus themselves, thus negating novel benefits from our otherwise effort to soften our duties (or means for freedom) or acquire more. For as it were, freedom is the state where your off your guard and without fear of retreating; where in fact, all that is pleasant in this world opens up to you, and to that you reply. So, having more freedom is like having more money than you need: it gives you only means to acquire that which softens your means, or indulgence, which will simply refer to acquiring more goods and fortune than freedom requires.
            <br>&emsp;At this point we come to the question of quality. For, I cannot immediately say that comforts and pleasure, excitement and exotic anticipations are not worthwhile, I simply cannot. I can say however, following our model, that such things will require effort themselves, beyond what freedom requires, and as such, takes away what could otherwise be allocated towards those treats of liberty, or fruits of freedom rather. In this though, we can consider what is in fact worthwhile. We do this by stating qualities which would mark the highest worth in our results, then analyze our natures to see what we are fitting towards, and then, by assessing other objects, or suiters rather for our potential effort, we can see which ones, upon fitting, yield such qualities in their effects. As a pure example, we are aerobic creatures, and thus a pursuit which leaves us without oxygen is almost definitively inconsistent in what it affords; for perhaps such end held a desire, and gave you pleasure in fact, but then removed your oxygen, and thus congruency with nature (or yours rather). This, as an aim, or value we’ll say does not qualify as a good one. There is the notion of right and wrong compared to the notion of good and bad, but we’ll return to that later.
            <br>&emsp;In summary, there are things which we need, and more or less, our time and attention smelts itself to that which seems fitting. Water calls out to us, by its smell even, as do things taste so we’ll eat it; even our body shivers to keep warm. The thing is, when those forces of nature cede, so are her pleasant hues visible. What those of us in modern times do, is work past the point where this is accessible, hunkering instead for more, or at least relieving how we achieved what we had (with softeners, or comforts). I believe though that we are too impressed and motivated to move ahead, but have little time, and thus experience, of having what is in fact enough. This, again, is a state of reproach, which is perhaps a privileged sort, but one where ambition and fluff hold no regard. And, this itself is a pure way to peace, which is no small comfort itself. But, it is the view that you see and ability to be further drawn, that sparks the motion of your vibrant heart, and calls you to move towards something as opposed to bracing against the conditions laid upon you. When these are met, and rest sinks in, her marvelous sides become exposed, and the joy which comes from such liberty (to see), is worth attending to, and thus, of those higher pleasures and ambitions, reproaching from that.

        <div id="priorities">
            As an early thought, is there worth in going where others may take you, that is, I am wondering if the fruits of our time are there via the hands of others, and whether or not we'd be better off meeting them as to follow their line.
            <br>&emsp;For one, priorities make a scenario what it is, as do oppertunities not litter your way. So possibility has more place for those who are out there, but for what a priority will be claimed. This is a seperate concern though, for we are not talking about the objective course of our live, but rather the tracks which we may take as to find more fortune. I'm not sure really.
            <br>&emsp;The sense that I have is that were missing what others could offer, as though they were going on a trip. The question though does'nt seem to be about whether or not this is true, for surely it aint; or, at least as you'd expect what could happen from such course, that it would be along the lines of activity and priorities, rather than adventure.
            <br>&emsp;In any case, what I would say on this front of delights, is that even if someone were offering there hand, would you go? And part of me says sure, for as travel mates we could still ingrave our way, or remain at least to what we find important. And by the nature of what we'd be doing, so could the logistic crumbiness be overcome. The issue is not what would become our purpose, or at least what the fortune would offer; in this I mean that occasions and what not would be our aim, which admittedly would be fine, and not neccessarily draining to simple ways. Perhaps the question does lie in terms of reproach, as meandering around, and focusing on sights and pleasure at the expense of frugality, does seem to happen. I just can't overlook the offer here, in that it provides highlights, either anticpated or relfected, but a real course of life. For again, going anywhere will permitt possibility and change, but as for what is desirable and pleasing, I don't think the backgrounds of new places would suffice, if they were not in fact the scenery of real activity. "Or what we find dear at least." For if someone asked if I wanted to go diving in Mexico, that is just an activity at hand, and equal at most to our own. So I fret not. Yet if the offer was one of globe trotting, I think that in that trotting I would not be alright. If we had no roots in the harmony between reproach and activity, then perhaps my idle comforts would seek more abundant ones. But of those which come, they seem less appealing. A fortune for sure, but not for me.
            <br>&emsp;Still, when it comes to possibility, you can't help but note the benefit in going somewhere new, being out at least. Yet the problem comes around, as what you would be offered to do is down a path which is contrary to the aspects which you find dear. And those would be finer with a novel backdrop, but that liberty is not ours. What were asking is, beyond our present works and gradual expand, where would the hand of others profit you, or delight you no less. And simply, I think that for the latter there would be too much fluff for the calmer, peacefull look on the world to be enjoyed; better yet, if you removed yourself from that grundge, I'm not sure the fortune would be at hand -for by that givers hand, would you not share, and if not so, not grows? This, to be clear, is that if rigtheous activty and genuine splendor is your treat, then so are crumby activities a drain, however marbled with granduer and comfort. Then, when we think of possibility, we still run into the issue of priority; for whichever one we had, the others would be excluded. And our burden is not of memory, but rather of experience leading to preservation, for these treats are not to be triffled with. Considering the details, ought we defend whats precious against choices which provide poor treatment. Even if the offer was to do more what you seek, who is yeilding you this, and would in such a way? There is truth in this, but still, I would raise the neccesity of bringing what you wish to continue with to the table; for offers of support and conquest would be of what you were when that intrigue was sparked. And so being yourself, or at least reflecting who you are in what you find dear, holds the only course of action for both your natural shine and attraction, and righteous receptivity. "Which the offer of going abroad fails, less it is one of novel autonomy."
            <br>&emsp;On top of that, there is no definite bend to where and when you are, only that you would be some place. And this it seems, holds small regards for someone already with priorities. This, seems the question, or at least dynamic in play. If you have free time, should you focus on what you wish to do and bring it out that way, or should you invest yourself in other affairs as to allow for possible impressions and conseuqence treatment? Either could do. And to be clear, the former stance holds less novelty, as the progress of our civility occurs in mere retrospect, as we are otherwise in diligent immediacy; while the wares of the latter, all be it receptive and aware of some time ahead, meanders a little as that time passes, especially when it is usually by the post of an itinerary, which makes your otherwise prudent resolve a conflicting one. "In other words, if being more social allows for outward benefit, so is it only fair when the suiter, being you, who would recievie is integral to what would be worth advancing, such state could only be describe as one of balanced advanced, as you are neither all the way into the work and thus your youself -still, while progressing- nor are you indebted or obliged to the whims called on by your civil demands (in relief, certainty or remission that is)." And so, in short, the focused and plain life is a simpler one, and more effective one in a given moment, while the outward life which holds integrity is more difficult, as you are by neccessity holding more -and perhaps less full from your less focused expression. Still though, if you fall over this point, or fail to recede enough, your no where.
            <br>&emsp;Personally, I have doubts that being in that outward place would offer any real benefits for how we are sincerely. Nor am I too short on our private position, for if the former is true, and at least if our vision witholds us from being casually social, then the work being done in a time of reproach seems to offer more, at least if it can be constant through solitude. For in each scenario, it seems the bank is on what will benefit you more, or earn you the best. And I feel that its moreso for the oppertunity of dreams and monarchy that the outward life proclaims, while the actual work at hand prefers the time and place, and remission of others, where focus on it can be had; and the furthering completion of that sees how the shine of it will sparkle naturally, requiring little of us, 'as the birds sing, which is pleasing, and the bees begin to churn, encouraging the growth of flowers, which attracts, and all so we may stand, and feel the fruits grow, to which all present are nourished'. For where, I am not sure.
        </div>
        <div id="commissioned">
            I seek a friend because in that, we can share responsability. Our body needs regards, as does our family and civil respect; we'll die, become injured or ill, as do the treats of the world and craft require diligence and care; even the tracks of ambition require consistency, the ends of which still hold us from being done, less we become idle. By those counts, we are always in motion, or dealing with something at least. And this warm feeling I get from another, who may understand, is mishapen into this figure of relief and fortune: yet our duty will not go. Nor, to be clear, would the remission of that duty even foster the sincerest of fruits in that fortune. Or at least, if we had no regards for our time, so do our bodies remain; and from that negligence cuts you off from decency and gratitude, which even the wonderous of lands could not make up for.
            <br>&emsp;The truth though is that we will die; our very nature as tissue'd bodies says so, for if they become ill-saturate we cannot hear, see or speak: and such parts of us will surely wither away. Even if this weren't true, we still would have to confer to the ways of other people, for conflict would otherwise ensue. "I am not sure what immortality or non condition would hinder a bullet entering your head; so even if were unlimited, couldn't we still end?" From this spot in which I write, my hands and mind do so in this body I have. And it poops alot, pees, breathes, cowers, frets, shrinks, grows, whines, obtains and so forth. Yet, be it the green you could see or the grip of on your helm, so is the tending of this a requirment. For even if all movements were permitted, so would we need rest. And the truth is that not all lands are for us to step in, nor is any real spot easy to advance to without prioritizing on it.
            <br>&emsp;This notion is a diffiuclt one so let us divulge. Nothing is free for you; even the fortunes you have are made available by the work of others; and so must you commit to access them. Moreso, the roads and borders of the world are not free to travel on or drive. And so if by luck or effort you obtain these means, so will your state in doing so be from your effort. The question then is it worth to prioritize, at least for things outside your home. For one, your home is likely where you will return to. And even if it is not, so are you absent from those who will. Even if this nomadic life is preferable, it is only the backdrop which neccesarily changes. Or in other words the value is in that. Who is to say whether that would be preferable or not; but we can say that it requires great emphasis in your effort to obtain, for you must make your through it as you go. And the point, is that although going somewhere is an interesting way to spend your time, and novelty holds your satisfaction in place, so are you beneath the realm of activity, at least if your intent was to read, study, write, reflect, run, watch or play, so are these in demand of there own efforts, which albeit supported by the comfort that novelty brings, so in there case is discipline required. In practice, the means for the former is not so clean and simple, at least to do so fully. By those accounts you may reach a point where that could be done, but so are you in the same scenario while your at home. That is, you must still be attendtead do if activity is sought for there; nor are the interests of people and fitness short of needed effort. In that, you may throw yourselves into these things, successfully even. But if you then decide to move and travel, how will these things follow? There effort won't lessen its requirement, and accordingly, the priorities of your means to travel will either have compramise those former while these are given emphasis, or you won't be able to do as much as your activities only afford so much effort to travel -and it thus won't be of a lasting kind. It just seems that death, friends, eveness and culture require a constant attention. The difficulty is not the point, only that you would not stop your efforts if the point had been reached -as another will not return. A not unimportant point is that those needs at the back hold no loosening in any scenario. Your leisure may change as will your people, but the constant for death and self regard holds no passing bar; and even if your time is elsewhere granted, so will a negligence of those former make any fortunes fall. And maturity it seems is the acceptance of that fact, and remission of seeking what holds little value while these things are addressed. In other word, the virtues of solidity, reproach, admiration, regularity, steadyness, honesty, integrity, fortitude, eveness, affability, industry, reverence, receptivity and so forth, make way for desires and aversions which are both resptive and congenial to them, but also vibrant and erect from the constant, immediate, natural, gradual, committed and considerate grounds. Which, to be clear, the merest of novelties does not pass by as a thing to be delighted, but to prioritize and highlight, seems short of warranting compramise.
            <br>&emsp;In that case we can say that we are commissioned, to live well and die truly. All, through the measured and amened approach to the rifts and edges of lives lasting play. Virtue and treats run accordingly. And being so, we seek a friend, in that we share such means and gratuity. This is not the care of romance, as that seems more in line to remove negativity; yet, those or more likely than not born from what we are lacking, as compared to what we are naturally born to do. And in that sense, we cannot overcome or avoid our condition, but rather amend, surrender if you will. And seeking others who will do the same seems favorable, yet in it we can have rest while we confirm what we have is already enough, as are we clear and efficient in our own embrace.
        </div>
        <div id="fortune">
            A strange question, which admittedly brings up this remark about 'really, were not going to get this and that, when will our virtue bring us fortune?', and my statement is simply that the purpose of virtue is, well, unclear. But I can tell that fortune is not so easily come by as it is, and our luck as more in line with our course, which again, could admittedly be what brings you love and coin, but naturally as we destined to be. Virtue though, seems like a neccessary relation, as forgoing suggests that your duty is done, which even if all the fortune was here in the world, of whom would still be employed. In any case, we can speak to the favor and apprecitaion that things offer, nor can we fail to make fair choices to acquire things. But it is not what virtue is for, or our life at least. As the Stoics say, 'we should take what we get with grace, as it may be either taken away or, in some cases, not given: and whether you choose to begrieve this and pursue it, determines if you would otherwise forgo it and keep to virtue and her attendance'. So, again, there is much in this world and a great deal of it is set for us to be. Yet, our efforts should stretch nothing more than whats natural and inherited for this to be so. That is, if you live in 20th century Canada, then respect your liberties, and make honest use of them while you can; but if there taken away, or if your somewhere where theres no chance they'll be given, then appreciate what else you have and fortify yourself against the lacking. It is not in our power to give, nor is it forgotten when we try to, as our sensibility, purity, eveness and health come short of fruition with that depleted hand. But, the point, is that so long as virtue is required, so are we not set on novelties or occasions: or in other words where we can go. For how could you be bored when theres virtue to be had; for, primarily, if it is norushing then so can your attention be grabbed; while, if depleted beyond that, so can the firmness conjured for neccessity be employed towards thought, craft and care.
            <br>&emsp;Which brings up the question, 'what is it for'. As, I feel like our amends are in check, and rightfully so as there plummage has grown to become a world of its own -like were purely fortuned. Yet, I am still overlooking how much we have done, or better said how much room our recent complacency has given us room to grow. Nor are we failing to confuse what would make the consequent struggle remedied. For, as it were, we are disposed to well being, yet in our privilage and immaturty, we squeeze out the previously built up juices. Then, we look for others, or something to allievate the infirmities. But this is so form neglegence; nor was it a mistake, as if there were a point we could reach where new things could be prioritized, as if virtue's neccessity would cease its hold.
            <br>&emsp;As I sit here then, readily I'd add, I am unsure where I should go? Or what I should know, or generally what I should do. First, I would permiit the removal of those degenerate constructs, which is not to speak to the subjects in question, but your view of them. Jen is not a remedy to your suffering: that, be it from and thus consequently from the repair, is virtues place. "For she seems so fine, like all others, in our waining light." She is still there, like those others, yet, I can see as our flame begins to rise, that what we need and how those things are in a favorable way to us, is akin to friendship, that through our virtue and industry they'd share, or accept me at least.
        </div>
        <div id="likeme">
            So defintiively, we are living rationally. That is, we are beyond tradition, which in a way reflects heeding survivability, and going pas the novel customs born from those, and instead configuring ourselves in a way that is actually becoming of the freedom in which our reason's tailored.
            <br>&emsp;Looking for another though, or anything at that, what fits in our reason. In this I don't mean where we should strive, but rather what is in fact privy to our tasks and delight, as opposed to those which require amendmnents themself. The first rule is to dispose yourself and act as if you are free, at least as reason has subjected you. "The point being that we surely have enough, and instead of making more out of what we had to meet our needs, we'll use our ability to only do so much as there is need, but otherwise use our liberty." For what are we striving for if we already have enough. And, in a way, is more discipline for the world required? For she will only give you more of what you already have. Or, she may offer the means to go somewhere, as to relief your idlness through modernity. What I would say, is that we can turn the attention to ourselves, as theism did for the course of our lives. In that, our thoughtfull life is one which details things less evident to comply with. For we all need homes and provision, and growing through that seems acceptable. Only, if the mean of this can be acquired so easily through our developed ways, why not at least appreaciate this and relish the peace; you might even see, so much that your drawn to elective (as comapred to neccessary) industry. Hereby the fruits of virute shower their way. Even if in this I am not disposed, I still won't act like I need more. And admittedly, I won't pretend my need otherwise to do something is not subject to that task of elected action, or at least incorporating the ease in which I've experienced, and letting whats beyond the veil draw me.
            <br>&emsp;Who will live this way, I do not know; for some are still not so peacefull, or well off to ignore those who demand from them otherwise. The question though, is who we really should be, or rather what is our purpose when all our neccessities are owned. I can see how the start of this really incorporates this, as if a roof over your head and bread in your belly wasn't enough, at least for you to recognize this and feel nothing more is but a surplus. What then ought we do. Well, for one, that meeting of survial is really just your tissue coming to fruition, and enacting its mechanisms as to keep itself going. As those needs are met though, adding more is no mans game. Nor, as I see it, is the tradition of elaborating on those elements which seem of survivals eseential; meaning, that we get more and more and find further goods in what otherwise makes what is already enough, either more so, or at least more secure. Yet, as time goes, it appeats that the limit of keeping those needs is not in a lack of what of custom proposes, but recognizing what is enough and abiding to that simply. What I see then, is that if we are left with no needs, or at any rate we are in a state of both safety and fortune, then world around will become seen. "This, as I see it, is the phenemona whereby we stopped worrying about Tigers and turned our eyes to the stars, for our attention was yeiled to the peace at hand, whereby the veil of the world is uncovered, to which that can draw our plans." For, im truth, there is something much different about reaching for or working around to get what is enough, comapred to already having it and being intrigued, as if those subjects were of what delighted us, rather than giving us relief -and incentive to prepare and defend. Other people may try, but it must not be mistaken that compatabilty is based on prominence, but composire rather and comssion. I see this very little in people, even though there is a sparkle of the kind. But there actions are not so. And we are not present or responsible to inspire them. Listen for sure, but where, in their taverns while they drink and yak! Honesty is usually dealt with privately, and we are really talking about furnishing a real effort into our life, so will they on their own amend, and strike upon you. Till then, we are as it seems, gratefull to be liberated from war, illness, poverty, and family trouble for that matter where theres privilage to find, nor is there any short amount of where this freedom can give, be it in books and the world, our own practice and writing, nature and her shades, other passer by's or those of a humored type, or games and other activity which we partake in. Theres so much, and not much could help but furnish this with a better backdrop, or fresh air admittedly.
            <br>&emsp;The question then, is what does this arean of life ask for? If it were food in our belly and a roof over our head, then mere participation in society would do; otherwise, engaging in foraging with others would suffice, or at least doing the best you could do. But what about when this is free and you have the heavens on your mind, whats required?
            <br>&emsp;Well, we must consider that our remedy to the elements is not much different than what is in fact a remedy to our curisoity. For, I would venture, that beyond retreating from severe heat and cold, that our attention really is there to guard us against threats, or at least keep us aware of things which are important. And when whats necccessary has been dealt with, it is not so that our attention goes away, but drifts around to things less pressing. Here is the veil which lifts and stars can be seen, or death recognized. So for me, even though there is a side to this which professes further knowledge, or in other words professes a more distant threat, so are we pleaded by things whose importance is more novel, such as its color and beauty, or grandeur and mystery; even those remarks about death, as if we had room for further regard, is likely when the nature of things itself and all other aspects of this sort come to accompany. And that marks the point, that as we seek more anwsers for things not known, so are things of wonder and delight in need of clarity themselves. For, it is true, that as we question our life and inquire as to what it means, so is that shooting star across the sky an equal mystery. We may have better grounds for defining far of threats, or realities, but so to is their a mark for those things glimmering with their own material difference. In a word, marks are those which reflect either ideas or things, and beyond whats historically been, we can at least say that it is when our attention develops past whats immediate, and we can rest and uncover, be it of further expectations or that of the real world.
            <br>&emsp;In a way, I am in some sense trying to uncover whether I am alright, or at least confirm whether I am in fact safe. "For so far, hell seems but an option of an otherwise weak position, but with nothing else contrarily known, regardless of strenght."
            <br>&emsp;Not to reduce this to a one term model, but our attention really can describe the human part of us. For again, we aren't curious as to why we take our hands away from fire, as our anatomy seems to procurr that. But we act and operate on a timely level, seems to worth knowing. For it seems to have its roots, as I said, in keeping alert and, more or less, set on the immediacy of survival. Yet, through industry and what not, so did we have further things to attend. Only, I don't suspect, as in this case, that there were immediate threats and immediate beauty; or at any rate, that could be the intermediary nature of fun, as if we know that the need of our guard was soon coming. Whereas, upon that liberty to further attend, so were both worries from afar to consider, as well as things of a positive intrigue. And for one, that former has not reached a conclusion, even though what we'd worry about has been removed of any strenght. Still, we do not know everything, and thus nothign is truly known, literally that is. It doesn't cost any sleep though. Nevertheless we still are free, and accordingly intrigued. For our attention remains, as we are in this still seepd in the oldest condition, merely with a near effortless grasp -or efficienct one at least. So, our fun is comparably present as those moment prior, only the intermission is not so subject to some expected dire moment. But rather, our life is quite meager and plain as we hold our roof and bread under our control, all till the resting portion of death. The roots of this may not be dug deep enough though, for why do we even have intention, why is their intrigure or curisoity, near sighted or not. "For instance, why do lion cubs play with eachother, or any baby for that matter who sniffs things and clambers around, finding out." All I can say is under that statement, or nature at least, while the condition remains, so are we uncompressed in our placement of it. And as such, our stretch of time, or at least thinness around that which were required to do, affords a lightness that proccurs broader curisoities and interests. Again, this is where stars are noticed, or moutains, the sun. And as it happened, these things were subjected to our reverence, be it stonehenge, Mobepi Tepay, or the Great Pyramids. These are what hold our attention, which we may simply say is a measure of us, that being attention holding creatures. And as our guard is down and the colors of life truly shine in, our equal amendment to possible danger and threats forges itself to those inputs of color. In a way, if a stick breaks we seek clarity, just as our idea of the Sun, or an idea even, draws more than just awe, but a need to define and profress, to know. Then, the response is one of relief, or at least action of a ceding or fleeting kind. And our mark of the sun draws a similar response, in that we treat it as we would all other impressions, differing only in the one we have. Weirdly though, there is a point to consider that the reason, for instance, that we built the pyramids, was not because we knew what Orion was but wanted to tribtue it, but as to color in our own input, as a figure that represented our notice of it. "As if stonehenge was there for us to arrange our thoughts (through industry) so that our understanding could literally be cemented."
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps our attentive nature is a liberty of its own, and we are in fact reactive animals, whose attention being helmed by us offers that lower body relief when the things we notice are dealt with. Were friends perhaps, as our body being in distress ruins our mentality. This is akin to anxiousness, that we sometimes only perceive threats, yet there from an imprisoned sort. In that, if the twig breaks, then we confirm what it is; and if it is a threat our body is pleased to move, and otherwise pleased to rest if its nothing. And because nothing so far off and colorfull is clear to cause us misery, we have no pressure to clarify it for preservation sake. Yet, we are drawn, like a moth to the flame. Maybe then, in fact, we seek not and will not know, but are rather fine to point.
        </div>
        <div id="obstacle">
            So I can see it, the pressure, or the impetus at least. "Your struggle marks the way, or the obstacle rather," as Aurelius says. Weirdly though, this thought comes from a man with nothing, and in a way, marks the fact that he is struggling under that scenario, but more or less sprouting through it. And I suspect that as he does, the part of him that is behind begins to solidify, which in effect allows him to stand from higher grounds -whereby the obstacle begins to tilt downwards.
            <br>&emsp;Now, I have a clear remark about this, but must get sidetracked as I ask the pointing question: what is the right obstacle? If you want drugs, money or sex, is the impetus to that the real mark of your way? Perhaps, and I would say that honesty comes into question as does wisdom, but generally I would say, for practicality's sake, that the purpose of the suggestion becomes qualified when you ask the question; and such a prompt does not come during your struggle, but after its completed, and doing so further seems futile. The moral is moreso one of constance, as opposed to an indicator.
            <br>&emsp;There is no obstacle, though, I can reflect the ill-integrity to this, for I in fact feel pressed away from what would be rest, or joy consequently. For me then, our responsibility keeps this prompt in question, as I otherwise seek for remedies and relief. "Your duty is the way, for doing breathes security and the according means for life." Then, as if idleness were checking in, you define those things which draw you so that their prompt is easier to see and align. Moreover, and perhaps to the point, that even if your 'responsibility' is over, realize that it is really not, for you must eat, and that is better to do so well; as do you have a family, who may frustrate you if you don't appropriate your spot on the roster; nor is your death to be overlooked, for without definition or understanding, life will feel small and or frightening; and otherwise, you may feel pushed to go live as you please, but find nothing but airy weaving and indulgence's hand. Doing these, which I would say is ever-present, breathes a forever deep and forward life into you, whereby the virtues of liberty come into your submission, and the treats of this world draw you to play.
        </div>
        <div id="delights">
            I recognize that I don't have any friends. But I am more keen on knowing what we need to be happy. For as I mentioned, my delights are those where you can throw yourself in: and to objects of fair obsession. Moreover, is friendship formed around when you share this in common. Just going somewhere, doing something, and of a right sort, is where friendship is bound.
            <br>&emsp;What I can attest to though is that what these things were as we grew, fell off of my interests, ie. drinking, partying, getting together to yak. This did not and still does not intrigue me. And as it were, whereas when we were young and had plenty besides our infatutions, at least enough to not have them linger, when we grew up so was there less for us to do, as were we more infatuated -and windedly through porn. This seems to me why were feeling this way, for there are all these untreated emotions; the difference being, that whereas before we had nothing, now we have alot. Only, this lane has less overlap with other people's, and so I am still drawn to other's. "In part because there is something more exciting; or, better yet, we have more appropriate means to converse with them." What I would say though, and perhaps its me confusing their interest with their permission of me being so loving, is that I over-estimate said interest in me, then hunger after them. But still, there is nothing which I wish to offer them in time, but rather I think they are interested; and weridly this is both exciting and appaling, for my loins over-exagerte our intent, and our otherwise presumption that their into me, leaves me worried, and in need of anwsering. I always go up to them, and they don't respond, they never did like me. I think part of the problem is that, at least till I could talk with them, I felt no reason to bolster myself to do so, for their interest wasn't really mine; and that because there were rules to follow, I did not see them as objects which I could just play with: either respect them, or go where your enthralled with interest, and viable. Now, we have the cordiality to 'play with them', yet, again, due to porn, our submission, and otherwise ignorance to what I can actually can, we think that they want either more of this conversation, or something further. In fact, my biggest strain is always under the knoweldge that all we seek is more conversation, but we barely see that person. And, personally, I see a rule that says you will not entice them or excite them to spend time doing so. The anwser though, seems to be if we are more or less togther (often), then so will that conversation bring us into a real relation, of value and our real person. This is hard though, as everyone is spread all over the place. In fact, the common route for us to gather, or see eachother that is, is by going out for drinks and food, or coming over to another's home for the same. Getting coffee isn't a regular thing. Nor are you elsewhere invited. For, even if a unique scenario comes up, if you hadn't been seeing them reguarly, then you wont be considered.
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps, at the end of the day, I live a life of sincerity. I care only for what I can throw myself into, I appreicate the rules and only so much as they are needed to faciliate that, nothing more. And what I have done, for reasons I am sure can be known, is that, in being so alone in our sincerity, we overly connect with those who, like a stain, get my sincerity rubbed all over them; yet, in that, they seem like their newly collected, like their interest and aims don't reflect that, yet, for at least, there electric. And in that I assume that their no longer in hiding, and that we can be together as we try and be ourselves, which, again, has no real place. For the sake of it, say they are under my influence: it is wrong to presume, or consider, that they are somehow enlightened or changed, and that this new persona or state is what they wan't now, making you the prime suiter. "Because your so important, or specail rather in being so." And perhaps you are, but surely not for them.
            <br>&emsp;Our symptoms then are in believing this to be true; and in fact, our incompletness to our other way, is in fact what makes you so, for you want someone on your side. Weirdly, we never have an issue with avoiding there side; except, when we realize that they don't want us, and our interest is pulled in their direction; which itself is procurred by sensual excitmenet, whereby we think of them, undress them, feel known and bethorded by them: and when they tell me otherwise, I feel comepltely seperate: for our interests no longer have their prevalence, or at least their value is shot when our loined excitment is squashed. We feel depressed, then linger after them, worried about where they go, and if they'd think of me, and pass an invitation.
            <br>&emsp;So the lesson is don't keep doing this. For if you do, you can hopefully understand what is elsewhere precious and continue towards that. You have the means to be forward, but perhaps settle where your inhibitions let you; for if you think that Jen is here and wants to fuck you, your ill minded. Asking her for coffee though, is nice, but please come from a spot which isn't prefaced with her having an interest, or you being so smited. Positivity will win the day, but your wound is swelling. So let it heal by not furrying it up, nor should you feel abanodoned: and otherwise as you think of your better selfs excitemnt, it is really just to talk; and let your loss remind you what is enough, don't fight it, and your really heading will open up. For it is not the case that who Jen is and where she'll go is your abscence, but rather the embellishment that she wanted to be where you were, and she does not. Fret no more then if she is unavailable, for do you really need coffee? Besides, there isn't something special, so we'll go when we can. And if your a skinny, poor loser who lives with his mom and dad, the cheer on your heart and peace in your mind marks your own development, whereas she will what, not want to get coffee: for what else would she not want to do? For what you'd prefer she did, she never wanted to, nor what she would, you still do not. As a person though who's a friend of our family, she is at least worthwhile for that.
        </div>
        <div id="still">
            I figure that our lack of direction, or movement at least, is what causes me to feel seperate and insecure regarding other people. For even if their just going out, and generally their lives have more substantial things beyond that, I feel comaprably still. The lesson, or insight rather, is that we are fine to go our own way; and as it were, our comparison to their lives is due to our emotions getting so involved. Admittedly we have less going on, or at least our bounds are quite short in terms of community and people; and so when our foot is off the pedal, we seem rather still. Moreover, we have been somewhat drawn to others, though our plainer pace of life is not so apparently conducive towards them.
            <br>&emsp;We just need to focus on our own motions, be it about writing, church and friends, or our own living and care. This will round us out, and leave us with less attachment, shortness of size, or care even for we will have both a direction and love of our own. Reason does remove the falsity and pretense of other people, but our impetus is one of lacking, which itself comes from our being afraid -and contriving a poor resolve as to mend it. But we can be more open, and embrace our discomfort, again, whether that is in showing up for churhc, talking about games, learning about and submitting essays and proposals, and otherwise sinking into our own lives, marrying it to the truth found in reason, but wholesomey and fairly, whereby our output is less grinding and (dishonestly) aimed.
            <br>&emsp;Quickly, I will reiterate, or clarify a new found model. The cogs of it center on ones ability to thrive alone, in that they helm themselves with principal and liberty, and thereby earn the treats of joy and constancy, alongsid feeling present and gratefull to the world and nature around. Why is this plausible? For, in our testament, we have no dear friends, nor real intamcy, nor money and its sparkling future? How could we be happy, rich and free? Well, it leans on those named aspects; yet, the reality is, that although their is a genuine worth to doing so, the more you are out of line the less you will be pleased with your direction. Especially when you consider the line of maturity, and how becoming more acquainted with it ever close, leaves the minor shortcomings as stark and noticeble differences. "For it is in a way so clear that you are not, as what is, has been more often. And so as the average rises, so do the points beneath feel worse." What I've learned though is that this approach, or station rather into the realm of maturity, need not be reached with strain or insecuirty. For we are neither proving anything, or needing something more than the honest goods procurred by our reason. On that latter, I can remark that we are in fact set and pure regarding death, family, leisure and care; only, we have neglected friendship and community. It is fair to say that our imperfections of those former leave us wishing for the desirable aspects of that latter, but we have mistakenly pressed into those points where were lacking, at the cost of completly forgoing those communal ends. This need not be the case. Our ability to sit and sleep as we do, eat as we choose, care for and be measured, integral and strong, need not be forgone or dismissed as the vector and casing for our duty and time, so why forgo the relations of people, and the warmth that your lackings cause you to seek? For, those imperfections are fair, as our life reflection can show -and its natural virtue of progress. As such, your disposition can be rested on while your head stays up for further learning and refinement; but as it were, be it in negligence or the rightous completion, why not go to church, or do some yoga, just something beyond yourself. You need not worry about the demands, as they are casual and small, nor should you feel afraid of being yourself: the nature of these things in fact welcomes it. Moreso, is there room to meet people, or at least associate with a group and its otherwise regular gatherings. This adds needed, or welcomed strucutre to your life, which itself can ease your path to those personal matters. Adding to that, again, is the point that your current developments and purpose of them, bars you to no reserved degree.
            <br>&emsp;This is nice, exciting to. Admittedly as our principle wanes, or slacks a little, I feel perked up by the potential of such experiences, which is nice, but I am keen to remain somewhat calm and postured about it; for our intent may have our anticipation sparking up due to emotion as opposed to what you have any right to expect. The better approach is to lean into your discomfort, recongize the consistency and participation that your granted from trying, and otherwise be honest and sincere in your communication with whoever is there; in that, you can mold something intimate or friendly, and otherwise sink into the general support that the group brings.
        </div>

        <div id="reminiscent">
            I am having trouble with Jen. I care for her, in a way that is reminiscent of love. But I am not sure she sees me. Or, if she does, like me, our notice is drifting amidst the otherwise currents of our live, whereby the deepest part of us means to connect, yet theres earth and bone beyond that soul.
            <br>&emsp;In those respects I have a poor taste for her, as she goes here, goes there, and the imagery of her being somewhere other, breaths within me discontent. Moreso, I reckon that others celebrate her, while scorning me. As I see it, this is all down to an immature want for things, perhaps guarded by the past of provisions treated by our parents, and our current wish for me. As it stands, we behave differently, in that we are thoughtfull and without forward action. "Better said we are more staked on well being and its means, than being well off and the required ambition." This is fine, accepted even, and as time has shown, relatively improved in terms of familiarty and reaction -as older periods of my life were in these respects poor. Yet, the problem arises when the whims of our ways seek shelter (so to speak) from a differently natured end. Here we invite the hierarchy to overthrow us. Which is strange, because if there so willing to accept us, why not do so positively. For if I were otherwise and in a way comparable to you, so would the developments of that earn us a reward, or support even. As I find it, there is more of an indifference on offer, albeit lined with general privilage -as well as the liberties which are mine. But nothing else is quite keen to be given, particularly when it comes to furnishing our active aims.
            <br>&emsp;All that being said, our place here is one where we want to have our cake and eat it to. By those accounts, we are missing, and in practice quite seperate from what we love about those tender greens. Consequently, we want Jen, and are begrieved not to pursue this. What I find though is that philosophy has not given up her interest in me, nor have I forgotten what its like to take her hand. Only, my movement is stiffer than its been, and our steps are out of wack. From this, we see less of her, and rather than feel Jen (or whomever) as a accompanying ray, she gleams more significant. Again, theres frustration rooted in desire, as our wishes from Mom and Dad leave them with nothing to but withhold there hand; which in effect draws me into a defense, or at least the feeling like our understanding is in dissaray. This is not fair though, as without our needs (or fear even of not getting what we want), our home would be find, and increasingly too. But as it were, there are roots of mine which poorly mingle with theres, and such seperation causes me, in a way, to be both more berieved by someone other (for we are more distant from our own), but, more importantly, is that when we see that we are not (near her), or even if we are that our amends lean another way, so do we feel retreated from the according reasoning and taste towards that philosophical other. "And the point, is that however server our interest is, that our choice to otherwise prioritize feels unorthodox, unsupported, shamefull, and inferior." Again, though, this comes from us wanting more, and upon recieving less, feeling like we are being opposed. And that has really not occured, or appears to be happening.
        </div>
        <div id="shine">
            Friendship it seems is right at that edge whereby your own stature meets its rise, but no so far as to lean into someone and throw your shine. Nothing should be drenched, for that is no shine but a coloring. Let your vibrance pitch hues more gently, as if upon being tilted barely upwards, you can picture all. Theres just too much for me to be, and not forgo entries and or localles which pitch it down. Nor am I waiting for others to catch up, as if we in our shine have reached a point of completion. Not only is it false in that you will spend yourself away, but, if that were fine I would still argue against, and admitt whats more preferable, in that you no longer shine. There is just something about passion which is best reserved for those lighter colors; for they are more accessible and cover all. While trying to impart deep reds is not for those but whose around us; yet, are they not indebbted themselves, or in of responsability to be near them? How much can you afford, or to give up while your there? Friendship costs nothing, in that it is but a conversion of awareness, but no overlap or leaning on.
            <br>&emsp;What would you and Jen share? Everyone has there specialities, and admittedly all of us our capable of being eachothers friends. There is a cynic in me which rightfully or not says no, as if we couldn't be upfront as to relate purely on that. Perhaps theres a matter of education, in that what you feel is important is easier to share with someone who feels the same. That is why anyone can share about their excitement for school or griecence regarding a job. About our health though or learning, our deepest regrets or intent about our family and friends, our philosophy, the nector of inquiry and nature, where is there room to talk about these things, both in the sense that similarities here hold a sparse domain, nor, do the roots which bring such aims hold normal places as acceptable means for converse. Hell, I won't even sit in a chair.
            <br>&emsp;But that is besides the point; for my place in being incredibly mature is not one of remission, but what my life brings. For I will sit if need be, whether or asked or of neccessity. It is just so that be it from family friends, old ones, work peers or anyone passing by, that none either A) attract me, or encourage much hope that we'd share an aim for repsonability, and similar ones at that, or B) invite me or draw me to spend time with them out of interest or commonality. We may game, but even then, we are not really that close of friends if this is our extent.
            <br>&emsp;I have known Jen some time; and I've always thought that were going to be together -as if were made for eachother. I musn't mistake this as some prophecy though, as she is a person no differnet than me, nor anyone else in the world. Were nothing special, even if circumstance would tie us together. She has always been more ambitous than I, in school and travels. Her parents are a bit of a mess, and I see something bare because of this. Also, I have caught the attention of her ideals (as a vegan), which seem more like meaning for her as opposed to reason. "Why should we care if animals are slaughtered? Is not eating them all your going to do? And if you were, in both the means and reality in which you'd address, are you so familiar?" Still, in saying that, I cannot help but see her as a strong women, similar to what Jess has become. There in there own lifes and minds though, preferable or not. And the reality is that we have our condition, our family, self regard and its friction of friends; nor are we free and exempt from wanting more freedom and privilage, nor are we unsusceptible to find this in larger things, but for a moment, while our own inner attention would breathe a full casting light and respect.
            <br>&emsp;Our problems are not based on abscences but a condition. Like Atlas, the world is not his burden but his duty to respect, as are mine when it comes to nature, family, friends and death. This is where negativity creeps in through our neglagence; and our humility to do so and heed the mere freshness of air, is where the fruits of real living and its nector go. Passion falls too far infront of this, as if we cannot see what lurks behind us due to its overwhelming flame. Neglect falls to far behind, and can cause us to reach further forward; or at least it breathes more night into the fire, making appear more.
            <br>&emsp;And so, wherever Jen goes, she may be impressed by and ordained to passion; but so will she ignore what lurks below; nor will she be present to the humble breadths of those mature fruits -like corn which sinks.
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps that is our claim, not that we wouldn;t address things due to their height, but that we'd pay no attention how we get there. That is for time and learning, and no discipline or action is needed in order to make that happen. "Nor is haste or hulking effort appropriate." Simply, you want to bend; and in reality there is no height in which this cannot be so. However, it is only from maturing that we do so, whereby we surrender and accpet what were given, embrace our abilitites to experience that light, and move forward while collecting more of this pure matter, whereby we then see the whole world covered in light
        </div>
        <div id="dugin">
            Not to speak of maturity, or the point past it at least, but from the beginning, we all have a moat. This we'll say is caused by our natural condition, and how our circumsatance and joinging resolve scurry us through it. Simply, you can tell if someone is dug deep, and whether or not they have cleared it out. "Whereby they'd stand from that far back."
            <br>&emsp;For myself, I have a a somewhat deep that rugged hole, which admittedly I have filled in over the years, and have polished. Jess it seems has her own depths and ruggedness, though I don't know exactly how. In truth, I know little of her insecurities. But, from my obscertaion, she has filled in what she had to, though less polished then me; which is to say taht alhtough she strands from afar, she does so with less grace or simplicity as I do. In effect, she flaunts and sweats a little, as if she is counteracting her inability to be plainly bold.
            <br>&emsp;Justin it would seem has less depth, for I see little regret in his eyes. There are norms for us all, but I am unsure if he is right ot classify beyond a tier 1 childhood. Of interest though, Justin is a bit of a momma's boy, and although never to hurt, is quite a spoiled complainer. By these accounts, he has not seemed to fill in those holes, however minor they are. Colin on the other hand as deep runs down into the crevaces of his soul. I am not sure if his life is ruled by conflict, by I know his dad was quite strict, and his place in the world is perhaps linched between being fairly well looked after and privilige (though I don't mean spoiled, as he is in fact not an abuser of that), and the fact that he is adopted, 'as if his life has no certain reason'. I am unsure how much he has dealth with this. But I can say there is alot of emotions in his heart which bring to feel some importance; yet, in that, his maturing seems to come by doing the opposite, as if his destiny is plain. "I just feel like this are compensations for him being so aware of himself."
            <br>&emsp;Jen has a hard past as I've come to know. I knew little of her dad, but I do that he left when she was young. Then her mom got together with another, married, had another kid, then later (following our acquaintence) split. Jen moved later on, and I hadn't seen her till recently. In my mind, I see someone who has bright ambitions marbled with self respect. Yet, when I communicate with her, there is this air of correction, or snideness -but friendly though. Nor, is she calm in her pride or upright, like she is reaching for someone, and bracing a little as Jess does. What I think, is that Jen is trying to find herself, or establish some meaingfull purpose by her own right. "Her doing so from afar makes it near impossible to consider being present in our own life." My point though, is that I don't think she has done much digging. In general, I suspect her autonomy has been ushered out from a mixture of conflict and distrust. She is bright, willfull, adventurous, and pretty. But I see no one who has found much rest, or at least is brimming from the siutaion she's conjured. What I see, though am fool to feel obliged, is that she wants more securtiy from within. For, what I see, is a stock of experiences which have brought her forth, forged positivity in all that surrounds, but not from within. Dark Matter appears to work this way, that as radiation sheds from ordinary matter, so does dark matter prevent it from imploding. The pull from outside though, or that which makes you enlightened, cannot be so enthralling or sufficient when it feels like theres no ground below. Where am I to contribute here, I do not know. But we are not meant to leave ourselves (whereby we stand from below) to go off with her on her whims; nor are we to mingle with her fainter complexions, and therein help her refill what she has below.
            <br>&emsp;In other words, there is this space between us, and some of us reaach it from below, while others sit infront, unware or unkeen to see or embrace the darkness behind, and instead have their eye on the space infront. On that end though, there is a lot of time which is spent in that centered place; this is while your working, before or right after; when you sleep and before, while your waiting, watching TV, or in short, between occassions or activity. Vacations mean to overflow you with the former, as the whole thing is of the sort; while activity in reality just comes and goes; for how much is there really to do, and of any interesting sort. That is why we seek company, for it is exciting; yet, if your honest, how much of your time really is your own? Moreso, on our end, is that place in front more fair and encompassing, while I suspect that those whos view comes from a place infront has less depth, but is in fact mor concrete, as if they can nearly see it -which in a way spills on you longing and regret, for it seems right there, yet your held back.
            <br>&emsp;A real dissapoint for me is having to impart the truth in the matter. For I realize that Jen must be sad, or at least there must be something missing -which we are not surely the remedy. But, I cannot fret over that, though I can remark our own dishonesty and how that has me less pleased for whichever pleasure they have, but instead having to illustrate their position. As it stands, to be fair, wherever they go, have gone or are going, so are they in that normal state. And this is not so pleasing, as it is always looking for more; and however delighted or excited, it is not really consistent, as without your lacking, and how absent are you from that. Figuring out where we should go really comes from the other side of the spectrum whereby address our place far behind, and how reaching this neutral place of company has no real means to go further. And because of so, even if others are not but a bit far back, so are we outside the realm of possibility. Still, our peace and prospering remains, as do normal occasions bring us together, reguarly perhpas through a post. So at least in those can you mingle in an appropraite way. Yet, for what I do not know. For we are not missing out, as those infront really aren't gaingin. Nor is it our place or reality to expect that they will recede into a layer closer to your own.

        <div id="thesea">
            Jen has left. Oh dear how we were excited at the temptation to connect. Yet, we let ourselves get hurried away, because we thought it both possible and pleasing. Now, we are unable to go, for virtue prefers I stay here and live a certain way. And trotting along through even the richest paths hold little dear if were merely passing by. The greatest delight in this world is surrendering your view to it, as to be present with it no matter where you go, and in turn watch its currents blow. "And the constellations, albeit at different points, move not in the sky but orbit our attention as we do, yet in all, there is the same, still in reality, constant in its coming around -relatively." So for me, there is no hill which I could not sit on or read, no sunrise which would't sparkle, no clouds which weren't a dream.
            <br>&emsp;Going somewhere it seems is more about stretching your legs, or finding more purpose, perhaps, in the inherit possability. But for what? To resume your peacefull findings? A course of action is laid for all of us, and beyond what is known and presume to come from afar, bears no hold on how you more near proceed. That former, by reflective accounts, is meant to remove your worry, and in a way soften your occupation to present, as it may seem like nothing is far ahead. But, when I look at what there is, or better put, where I'd be fine to reprieve and naturally grow, theres no pre-requisite for where I'd have to be; which, to the point, holds no axe over my head that we are forgetting something. For what I want, truly, is an open road, a mind to procceed without hinderence; if it is stationary we'll let that be a result of time, but not something we fear; for we may be here or at some point go there, but so will we continue to be part of the stream. "And distractions are those which otherwise pull you away as if there will be something new and wortwhile for excitement." When in fact, even the coziest dusk near the Bengal Sea, would exert nothing different in my, but a then fair and gratefull complexion, to hear the sea, relish the rising moon and stars, and otherwise rest on the grander notion of every clouds faintness, as it lastly lets go of the leaving light. Theres not much more than this: and, declaritively, we will be either honest, and at the very least, not give up. "For who wouldn't want an experience which was worth that of pure content, and our moving hands. Rather than the treatment and miseries of our busy minds." Where do you have to go, what do you have to be? I recall there being a confusion of others seeing merrit besides me, but they'll find their own way. In fact, our place is indifferent, as their greatness is found where and whenever they are. "And we should not feel like were outside of the collection, in that we are not whats needed by them; for whatever it is, so will it be small, but only for the life which is pleasant." Whereby our own needs are small, and we achieve such change accordingly. Pretending though like anything other won't require so much more, makes me averse to being besides that. "theres a lot of work, and little to compensate for the strain, for only more comes, and as such unsettles you into further efforts that let you go. And where is there room for jealousy or melancholy in repeating yourself. Shan't we proceed pleasently, prepping more for what amount's to needing less, where the stream takes us"

        <div id="ironheart">
            Here is a quick confession -and do please count this one, that is, as the scale by which prior notes are judged by (for this is what those mean).
            <br>&emsp;Simply, I am a man, but a lonely person. This is so, for I did not what I was told, but what I felt was right. In truth, this post only lacked in a friend, or someone I could share my triumphs and defeats with.
            <br>&emsp;As for women though, their prescence was always one so enticing; so much so in fact, that I have a view of there being women, as opposed to mere people. At any rate, my lonesome heart yearned for people, or at least was struck by them with dear complexity. This, as I see now, was merely a symptom of our wish to return to a normal life, one which held itself together without so much attention; and at the very least had more clear intention. "My own life otherwise, felt like it was always in need of the use of our fingertips."
            <br>&emsp;As it were though, I know that both I was foolish to anticipate these; better yet was it not quite so sincere, and evidently when my wish was thrown away infront of my face, I'd get mad, or at least feel crushed and dissapointed: and for my own sake, this was unacceptable, and for what such people deserved, was something more honestly generous.
            <br>&emsp;Still, I won't pretend like I am the only one out there. Though, I cannot say what a life like that is, for I only know my owm. In fact, a better way to say this, is I only know what a life is like for someone who's life is about a soul person: themselves. Yet, in that conjuring, or self direction rather, there is a poor compensation as the natural tasks and deficiencies cause you to slip. So I do hope you understand why I felt this way; and in a weird way, just know, that for all of you, that considering who I am, that you were the ones who appeared the most strong, and in a sense, could match me: at least you earned my respect.
            <br>&emsp;I know though that in my insincerity, I never did much for you to feel attracted. That insight held a severe point to my growth. Neverthless, I am now receded but onto the world, seeking little, pleased with alot. The impetus though remains, in that what I really want is a normal life. But in that though I have realized that what I truly seek is completion, or some sort of fufillment. The old roads seem to have this lined to the bit; but my course has held to interests and ends that reflect my own: I'm just not clear how to get there. This being the case though, I feel like I am able to be more open with you, or anyone for that matter. As I no longer have anything to hide, for I fear little in what I'd obtain. Seeking little who's purpose is not but a remedy, gives me clarity of the fog which I must bust. Knowing that this problem is there, contents me in asking, for time from you, and attention to myself. For I must confess that the greatest strain on my heart was in knowing that I had somewhere to go, but that adddressing so would make you appear absent. Something about this just hurts, even currently. Knowing though that the reason for that interest- is born from overlooking the real aim of my post, remedies that yearning disparity as our real goal becomes known. We are not missing then what we wish was ours, for the source of our intent has been clenched, 'or clamped if you will'. "Got it!" I find myself saying, "How do I exist in this otherwise modern world?" And again, I forget your neccessity, as I surrender to a task which requires no such amends. I do feel though that ordinary conversations can help, to which I plainly ask. And without remorse mind you, for I feel no loss as you go. I simply think that our gathering could be usefull.
            <div class="qu">So past our novel tinglings and wishes we've grown</div>
        </div>
        <div id="peace">
            Its fair to say that what comes to mind when I think of interests, is born and touted from what we need to do. In that, if we are centered on targets of acquisition, then so will our trouble remain; for not but our discplined efforts can get us there. And weirdly, this is its own sort of task; for in it, your goal is built into the struggle, that you would reach somewhere that is. Whereas in me, my target is based on attention, that having chipped back the layer of neccesity and solidifed myself into our basic floor, we can see that our civil responsabilities are in need of handling, as are our general views of the world and the grasp of ourselves. The difference, is that although doing this yeilds you a peace which is sounder and deeper, so does that open doors, to the world that is. Only, in this case, the draw is not some further acquistion, but a mark of expression, or inquiry that is. For with this veil lifted you are delighted, and accordingly taken. People have this affect, but their draw is one for the sake of heat and warmth. Whereas, our own habition yeilds us an even simmer, satiable and consistent: which upon, exposes us to the fainter objects at a distant, or at least those which would otherwise not reveal their glow.
            <br>&emsp;Worth noting then is that upon this finish, you begin to bow to those peacefull metrics, for not only are they rewarding, but simply pleasing in themself. And doing so bears potentialy harsh waters; for the road here is one of reproach; which itself is nothing idle, which in effect removes confidence or a yearn to some other. Only, reproach is hard, for it is your own to deal with, harder to define, and, in a somewhat positive way, susceptible to those genuine goods revealled to you, for they may in themselves prompt you to lean to far forward. And, in a word, slack is your treatment, and rest can be hard to find.
            <br>&emsp;I think this is mightily uncommon, for I know very few people who aren't subject to the same, and otherwise seeking the same relief. But I cannot consider how folks there are that either know, or at least approach the garmets of peace, albeit those marvelous strands which let themselves down upon doing so.
            <br>&emsp;Its weird, because everypme is tasked with ambition. And because this has the tendency to be more or less consuming, we either tighen grip as to get more of the goods on offer, or we try and escape, for some other source or kind of plunder. This is why there is an upper class, as middle wasn't; or on the flipside, hippies and, in a way, saints, adventurers if you will, going off the path to find some other reason. Only, for me, despite having those latter tendencies, the real things to address were right there infront of me, screaming their prescence and marking their effect from being ignored. That is how I found peace, and continued through the wonderful movements that followed.
            <br>&emsp;For Jen then, she is either moving backwards or forwards, and in either case we can not treat her. For in our case, we have already reproached, then proceeded, and now our objective lines the way. But if she is moving for the sake of acquistion, were irrelevant, nor is our time and path in an otherwise suspended state. We could surely more relate, but even then, that kind of motion is more private. There is no trouble with me proceeding, be towards the front like her, but seperate, or away while she steps back; she may even then see you infront, all sincere. But our task is to reach there, at least our aim is to attest to the interests that come from peace, which itself is rooted in responsabilities constancy. It is nice to meet her and share that were well, for at least then we are verified. But less she were a Goddess, so is there no overlap. That is ok though, and as she goes and we are not remembered, so are with home within, which itself houses the rest of the world, desipte her leaving our attention. The obstacle then is proceeding past this, for you may otherwise be dragged down by expectation, and otherwise whither as your real objectives are feel like there tearing you away from her. Even if she were throwing herself at me, asking me to watch movies and spend all this time, I'd still be best to be true to myself, whereby I would'nt want to watch a movie, nor would I want to have sex or things of the sort. Thats not whats importnat, but rather being ourselves. Relish it with me and we'll be friends. Otherwise, I am making the conscious effort to retain, or at least know that we'll proceed regardless of fortune, with integrity.
        </div>
        <div id="imagine">
            I just have some emtion; for I know that desire breeds fear, as Yoda says, which leads to hate, longing and suffering. We need Jen for some reason, or rather, we welcomed her interest, creeped on her vulnerability, and flattered ourselves in thinking we were deserving and or important in the first place. I don't know where to go though, for I have this chimeric innuendos of her, off being happy, not caring about me, while I sit here and mope. I just don't know; perhaps we have our own reality, and must deal with; but talking too can be nice, which we are trying to accomplish. Still, were overbent with what would obviously be preferable: someone showering you at your feet, of course. Again, you saw this where it was not; and over time this has developed, as it has, into severe dissapointment and longing, which leads to those chimeras. Still, there is this seperation from something which I new wasn't there, where that flattery and selfihsness comes in. No wonder you feel bad when your thoughts are of her leaving; moreso, of those thoughts which are raunchy, so do your grievences and attachment reflect that. "Burning sorts of envy"
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps the obvious anwser here, is that if you see her happy, on her own, far off into her own dreams, theres nothing for you. Yet, this is your wound, for you opened yourself to someone, wisdom being all that could tell you would fail. But you were hopefull, as were you longing, nor were you short of filth. Another aspect of this, is in regards to her struggle, which you may humbly suppose to (more) forecfully illustrate, being left out of this draws her, at the very least away from you, but more likely towards something other. At least, you feel, and again, you are bearing this to be true, prominently at least for you, that so long as she is not trusting you, you are not earning such, or shes trusting elsewhere. This is in fact a core source of our weariness, for we cannot be so happy for her, nor do we find ourselves relevant to her struggle; yet all of this, in terms of her place and prescence, is embellished by us. And it is just not so; for you do not know, nor is it one or the other. You can be proud of what you have and who you are, and attest to where you need not go, along with additionaly repetence.
            <br>&emsp;Lets imagine then, that she is sad, depressed, contained, but that you are not the anwser, without consideration; better yet, someone else is desirable, she can't wait to get back to her real home, and from there the world will bow before her, and she'll go off on adventures, judged as a women of virtue. Or, better yet, she's perfectly fine, right now, and sees you little; sure its nice to talk, but your lame, or at least she has no interest for; moreover, she is looking forward to great things, and this is a mere family predicament. What are you to do?
            <br>&emsp;Well, for one, use reason, which is to say be honest with yourself about this position; for even though it is a position born from your heart and loins, so is any of that which is desired unattainable. If its not happening then, your left as though she was not there, with all jealousy and room for spite. Still, what are you going to do. For she is not staying here, no will there be interest of connection: what about you? I say, for one, that you have your own obligations, or chores rather, in attribbuting your place under death, coomunicating and reciprocating your spot under your mother and father's nose, thinknig about your need for a friend and how a lack of care for reason and its objectives, fairs nothing short of whats average, ambitious or tempatious. This at the very least is required, along with an underlying spring of virtue, in both our deliberation and reflection, remedial spots, stretching, resting and training. "Worth adding is the removal of far off fancies, or, in other words, treating your actual self and all its unwarrantead desires; and at the very least, fortifying yourself against the natural embrace of life, appreciating what home and warmth you have, and otherwise forgoing indulgence and flattery for your own sake: in other words, removing words, ideas, feelings and actions, which are vain, hopeless, foolish, nieve and futile, that is, things which, even upon success, are an expense: which is to say they don't work with or find much room or energy for the steel plating and garnished wonder's of nature its commisery"
            <br>&emsp;What I have to ask, is what do you really want? To begin, I must claim that we have not always been accepted. This means that there was much time before this while our true self was pressing through resistance and the according curfluffery. As we are accepted now and our aims are somewhat sincere, there are all this strings behind me; which itself, suggests we unwind them. So I don't know: my anwser perhaps is 'being myself'. Not out of acceptence, but the strides and colorations that mark that, being vibrantly and splashingly so.
        </div>

        <div id="preoccupied">
            There's this weight, which holds me tight by the throat, judging me, sentecning me to change. This is our view of other people's objective, which is to say that they are clear and we are not. That latter though marks the problem, as our lack of objective is what shrinks our body, thus making it vulnerable to the impression of other people. "Who by the appearence of it, seem not so small." Yet, if you think about, few actually know their objective. For we all indeed amend to the fact that children, family, homes and cars require a career, yet of those aims we never actually ask, or clarify rather, that they are what the means are for. So, we may find meaning in something because it seems substantial, but has the objective really been vetted? For I do not know where I should go, or who I should become, but I know what seems commendable, what I enjoy and prefer, what I'd do over and over again, and, more or less, what defines our route of respect. These are the questions one should ask themselves, and otherwise be measured against in terms of their amendments validity.
            <div class="qu">And I feel strongly that none have done this, and that most are either cluelessly successfull, or equally clueless in their unsuccess -perhaps sulking over their apparent lack, or being complacent</div>
            I just think that even if making an impact is important, that you really haven't thought about what really makes you tick, what you like and enjoy, what speaks to you. These heraldings to the world's problems feel like someone hearing there perril and offering a response, but only because they have no other intention. "Nor are they short of seeing more than they should, as if your lack heeds them to overlook things, or exagerate as to find some focus." Otherwise, it seems like people go off and about, finding themselves by venturing forward or doing things that bring them some life; yet where would they settle? Better yet, if in fact they found what they'd like, would'nt they then be clear about that? In other words, would passivity upon exploration yeild a constancy of what you discovered is preferred. Or would you simply have mor appropraite material to be deliberate about, or at least guide you as to make decisions. But what choices have been really made, besides those laid infront of us. I just can't feel left out or improsoned because were not doing something cool. "These are but mere events in an otherwise aimless calender."
            <br>&emsp;Again, I just don't know what their aim is, be it reduced through our mortality, or specified under our reflection and intent. I just don't know. And the problem for me is, that if I don't know who I am, then others will seem far and ococupied. Yet, if I in fact do while they do not, then still will they seem all over the place, as their whims still feel like there running away from us. Put another way, people come together out of enjoyment and harmony; the former being of interests, or things that eachother likes, while the latter marks similarities in purpose and ambition, or aims rather. It is not easy to see how such an understanding is known, as it seems like people are brought together out of heat and passion before their truth is known. Still, we can reasonably consider that if someone has no objective, then their is no room beside me if mine is in fact known. Nor I to someone more clear if I were lesser.
            <br>&emsp;The reality then is that maturity humbles us away from what strikes is in our youthfull ways. For in these points we have not but room for ambition, as our standing and mind has not really developed in our truest way. Maturity holds us though by showing us that there are more suitable and integral actions than those which speak to our aimless whims. And thus, there is no place or station which will hold much purpose, for these are not what subsantiate our lives. These, at most, are means to bring such purpose out, but those are in need of their own definement. Moreose, it is likely that if you rest more neatly amidst the entire world and its ways, then the furnishings of your sould will be less of luxury or profression, but virtue. And in her wake a spring of delight, cheer, reverence and time comes to fruition, whereby those liberal parts of life become our objective. That is, as we manage our time and selves, so are we peacefully on our toes; accordingly, destinations nor things other draw our interest, but rather our participation of activites that we enjoy. "As I can reflect, as you are drawn that way, almost so by the prescence of your steady hand, you are asked to merely hold that, or cede rather any holdings of going further; for focus requires a cease of pre-occupation. Which is way great music makes you cry."
        </div>
        <div id="circle">
            The truth is that your are only going to get what your made for. This may be with splinters and scars, but your actions will be what procurr you ends. And priorittizing which require endless devotion in order to recieve the sweetest rewards is so important to remember. Because of course we could do this or expose ourselves to that, and even if that wasn't so bad in itself, for what end are you working for that would itself be good? For where in fact is everyone going? Even those who are fortunate or successfull, are they not so in their own little circle, which even the smallest towns have near a 1000. Why are we fretting over what someone else may have, as if there aren't three billion people with lesser, or at least are focused on their own. In that way, saying how many people definitively makes me feel like we should, as were so different otherwise. Don't mistake the actual figure though for what everyone does, for it is not true that everyone is on their own side successfull. Theres just no shade or relevance for what other people do.
            <br>&emsp;Its just so hard not to feel like we are the other, when this is in fact not true for this no base that we are contrast to. Our circle is Mom, Dad, Dora, Boots, Jess, Nova, Maevis, Carol, Brian and Shawn, Jan, next door and down our street, sunrivers drive and the overall community, Kamloops, the interior, BC, Western Canada, the country, this side of the world, the west, modernity, humanity. And per our time it is wonderfull; but, unfortunately subject to despair as our leniancy must be reprieved. Consequently, it feels like there is much were giving up, and otherwise the goods of our green feel hidden, and theres conflit and apathy in trying for them. There here though, nor are they over there: those priorities are different. Its a success thats not quite different then those ordained for law, in that they must be educated, employed, displciined and consistent, fair and and strong as they mitigate surrounding pleasures and duties. Even this seems respectable, for I do no frankly seek it, but at least there is something truly there. "The thorn in my side is in thinking that if we just went out there or said hello, that we'd be incorporated to a group, or friend, with endless travels and oppertunity." This is so hollow, for even those privilages were there, so are they amidst the rest of the world, so no one cares; but so aren't they absent from everything else you have to do, which makes these whims mere novelties. Or, even if such fortune is for you and your dearest way, so ought that be fortified and embraced, which may in fact run you contrary to the fortunes acquisition, which itself may in practice lessen the enjoyment of those.
            <br>&emsp;We've decieved ourselves though into thinking this is true, and our result is that we've overestimated the worth and our glamor of our friends and lovers around, as have we pinned ourselves against the remission from these -as if reprieve is taking place- and thus our actually treats or expectancy is hiddne. That is in fact the worst part, like were compramising. There isn't anywhere to go, nor do our fanatasies even hold much once there part is placed in the world. And it is there I wish to live, and without concession or hope do I say that where abouts in that localle I don't care, for it is and will be how I choose to, and presently so if virtue is our prize and aim. "Theres just no room to expect that your fortuity and charm will have the time or room to sparkle. That is something which must occur over generations, periods at least, for we must run true and far with it, for if we don't and sleep, there is so much room to step back and thus to return to. That is what I am feeling right now. Though, I will concede that as my head peaks abover water, so does it appear this is where all others wish to go. But forget not that there more likely than not (via that truth) drowning. And you cannot be expected go get them below. Nor should you expect them to rise; only, if while there is a low tide, will they see you acting as if this is the norm, perhaps they'll stay."
            <br>&emsp;Maybe the truth is that I live to far out in the ocean. Its free, easy and pleasing, but there is no oppertunity for us to cross another's path. Even if the lanes here are the same there, at least there would be more underneath. Yet by that, not all is so far away. Yet as our heart stretches our bounds, so do we feel small from longing.
        </div>
        <div id="others">
            We are just by ourself. So much it seems is required to draw other's attention, and being frank, the mere value of having so is that what you find valuable can be seen better, for another sees it. Yet, how is someone really supposed to see what you do, immediately at least. This is why, I think, that what people herald about relationships is when theres an understanding, your known. This is fair and, like a friendship where our aim in life is known, so are we right to miss; but when you think of all other relations, they seem like mere novelties or neccessity, or at any rate based on poor thinking and action. There really isn'y anything beyond what makes us truly happy, fearless and grounded; all that is good is so for it brings that; and others understanding that, on the casual end at least, remarks those truer relationships, in that they are resepctive of your actual worth, while on the other hand, friendship really just remarks an understanding of more serious things.
            <br>&emsp;It is clear from this, as I see it, that my gravest weakness is in wishing that others would be in trouble, directionless, without objectives, so that my own seemed enticing. This seems like it could be true in general, but there is our onw flair of prodigy, in that we almost expect them to favor ours, 'for how nice it must seem'.
            <br>&emsp;I think however, in plain, that we should never ever hurry or deplore someone for having different interests or aims from mine. Nor should you fret if yours are yours alone. "For prodigy, or purity in this case, may be a solo road." Or rather, to be fully understood means you must also bring yourself forth; which in its own right is worth cheering for, as even the barren sight of a soul around does not forgo you the knoweldge that what you bring will be sincerely forth: thus setting up the most rightous of possibilites. Moreose, where actions actually bring may not in fact be to a place which understands you. That may be reserved for yourself, your near family, and perhaps the inspired kind of those writers.
            <br>&emsp;Theres just so much to say, that our furried whims need no more worry, nor repetence at the thought of missing out. For there is this clear aspect to things, which is that when they are defined there is no envy or hate: for what your comparing you know is true. It is only those perceived fantasies which you find yourself negging, for it is in fact quite hard to explain why there wrong while also describing the futility. This is why hearing that someone is a lawyer, father, homeone, middle aged husband, dredds less than, 'did you hear Tom's a lawyer! Its as if theres no room for me to say, or consider, if theres more to that, as if its all glamor and what not. So when I think of someone I like, I fret not where they go for the pure reason that our interests are not in line. Much more importantly is that if our aims are different, then I know that we aren't being spat on while they go to somewhere, far from what I might otherwise think is our apparent nothingness. No, let there be direction for all, but so we can stand by it, rest by, accept is worth and reality as true. The very prescence of these factories is remedial, because it shows that others are either full of shit, or not so contempuous; moreos are we not vying for something with hope, then dissapointed, because we realize both that we actually have an aim, and then settle into what it is. "We can rest and see easily, even those things which would otherwise fluster our tempered mind; for with this aim, and the understanding that it is all everyone has, removes any impression of intrusion and that of pitiful lust." In a word, respect, is for both you and I, for I know that commradery is based on commonality; and at least, if I find mine and you find yours, then their need be no hostility or flaunting, nor repetence from me. "These are my according happineeses, where I oblige and retend. The particulars are their own, but so is there shortcomings or abscence on the road to singularity, where I may in fact share."

        <div id="knots">
            It is quite too easy to become mixed up with emotions. Whihc, like your tie to a mother, reflects your tie to others, who like an oasis, speak out as things whihc will rmeedy your struggle. What I would recognize then, is twofold. First, there is the matter of your tustle with love and longing, or at least the mishaps and knots that come with your emotions. The second though, is, upon recognition, addressing the reasons why the source of this 'remedies' are not in fact solid, nor the objects so securing. "At least, on that latter, what you think is fitting for the right state of mind, as compared to one which is grasping, or from a threat mind you, and how things are in this appearence are not in fact so credible, by virute of their glimmer being that of relief, while the truth in them may not be so for how you are in a generous, pleasing state."
            <br>&emsp;In other words, the truth will not surely set you free, as the knots of falsity still seep inside, and spark your curiosity towards things which benefit that. But, recognition can help you see that your swooning grievences and spite are not so for any reason but your need of a remedy, which, in addition, is itself a portion which can aid you in being treated 'as to remove the wound which has you eradically drawn'.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, there is no real connection in these cases, for what you see is an oppertunity; and even the slightest ineraction or response solidifies it as your objective. Unfortunatley you are not likely to recieve what you seek, for nothing true was there to bind you; and so you may obsess and hanger, but only so for your desire is off in its own direction, spreading far from you. This is the source of your jealousy, for every move they make sees you as irrelevant; spite also comes to play, as you feel ignored. Still, you may actually be less ordained to said person, place or thing, for you are more content with yourself. An error can occur though as your ruffled ways (that is, uneven virtue) leads to beleiving that others are interested in you, the source being your own flattery and importance. At any rate though, we can still recognize that it is those responses or interactions that our sensitivty springs on, as either something to move towards, or something which we anticipate coming towards us. It seems better, with being yourself as the right state of mind, that you would neither exepect them or reach for them, but offer, if at the very least to spread and display your interest; this way you may be known, no matter if your heeded. And you need not hanker at the thought of being unheard of, nor do you leave yourself exposes to baseless reception.
            <br>&emsp;From what I see, consequences are from our own misguidnace, or negligence at least. Otherwise, the weather is never quite so extreme, nor is their any element which marks an abscene of law, or goverment for that matter; the ability to feed and house yourselfs, simply, is quite in your control through the most basic of ways; and entertainment and information otherwise, is near and clearly accessible. Roads seem to get in the way sometime, for although they allow you go somewhere, they block, or at least fill, where you might just want to be. Still, the streets are safe for those who know their place, nor is any relevant figure of crime and punishment a concerning one. People are their own point of duty, but listening to them, being kind and thankfull, somewhat polite, and otherwise self-secure and honest, brings no harm or worry, perhaps even a friend.
            <br>&emsp;So I see no need to hanker for things or fret and regret over lost ambition. For we are fine, helmed with liberty and sense, plus the world to heed us. Our time is not but bristening with the contrasts to flattness, nor is our own color and mind too small to enlighten this. There is rot though, which comes from ignoring this reality, and seeping ourselves into one which feels neglected, scarse, impoverished and deserving; such commissery is prone to misery itself, for it must hold itself with outward constance, rather than inner purified strenght. Why this bearing is so prevalent, no matter; but for those not poor enough or strewn about, so is the reproach from such worries a marvelous promise. One must recognize though what the other will bring. For, if you were raised on books, writing, leisure and green activity, then you probally have no burrows and bounds to that life of ambition. In your case, reason continues to be the means for guidance. Whereas, those who are either absent of such a guide, or are mixed in terms of their past, so must we address the likely stretching, or susceptibility at any rate, for you to be on one side, but pulled by the elements of the other: for, as it were, your time in this newer side, or however much in reason, holds the bounds of ambition (so much as it has been present), which not only keeps you from going further down reasons line, but pulls you towards its own side of relief and worry: and what is in need of an address, is when reason outweighs this, yet there is still a nag at your behind, so must we recognize the source for that tearing, being us.
        </div>
        <div id="perfect">
            So we felt that perfection was required, as the words from our hand would run out, as perfect ones that is. And to be fair, I believe that sharpness is required, and have no problems with putting myself all in, 'for as I say, you can never put in enough'. However, beyond the expansion of the ideas themselves, their actual furnishing, or placement rather within our objective regard, holds both a substantial and steady pace. From that, there is room to involved yourself in accessory things, with the aim being one of converse, or possibility at least. Simply, you can ask someone to go out and speak to eachother, or you can ask if they play games. You also, to be clear, can remove your restriction from driving, so much as there are stakes to get work done: for in our wellness and collected pace, were enough. Yoga in the park might just be somewhere to go to, or a drop in, a free class or get-together, even an online chat. You could at least show up, and connect with people. Our communication skills also can, as I said, ask to go do something, or whether or not they play games; and prior to this, our introduction can be simple.
            <br>&emsp;I must admitt though that these bouts are tiring; at least, looking forward to them is a bit exhausting. Really, its just an activity and time, and your invovlement opens you up to the possibility of meeting people. Its up to you.
            <br>&emsp;The oddest thing which has changed is that we are no longer special, or our work. If you want the best of your ideas, then hold yourself accountable; but that is only if you like it, or rather if thats whats important to you. I dont feel like we have some God gifted talent or destiny to bestow, but rather I am close to our past years efforts; but admittedly, our wish to bring them out there, or the pressure to make them into so (as comapred to their loving advance) is out of our wish to impress people, acquire and be seen. This will not happen, as you will still have to go out there. And, in a way, your notoriety can add more heat to your 'general company', as in the case for our neighbours, but otherwise, you will still have to go out there to meet a friend. "Even if there were many waiting for you to show up." And seeing as we could, does that not have an equual stance if their not waiting? At least, in terms of whether going out there is fine, are you not able: even if the possibility is at most there, and you must try?
            <br>&emsp;For I felt that was got me leeched onto Jen, or Holly and Simron for that matter; as I thought that they were just sitting there, primed to welcome our embrace. Yet their not. And the notion was that our prioirities held us from driving and having fun -which we'd do together- so I felt like I was choosing that over them. Still though, such a choice was not the limiting factor. However, if they were viable, or if you did want to try, then being out there would be fine; only, doing so is what brings people together, in which something grows. We would just speak with them from time to time and think that they were drawn. Perhaps women are too much trouble then, or less likely to find; but a man, or friend rather, can become an acquaintance much simpler; and girls will be found and treated similar; only, if your hope is to go further than that, then the amount of effort will be further required.
            <br>&emsp;And maybe that is not what I wish to do. For I do mean to finish our writing, walk through the day, eat well and tend to our leisure and health; but we can jump into the zoom chat: there might be someone from Kamloops there, potentially at least. Or, you can go to yoga at the park, or make more of an effort to take regular classes at the gym; or down at the aeodrome; even the meditation class, all for the sake of getting involved, and otherwise mending yourself out to do others, be it newly or again. These are extensions to your life, and if you try, that their additions can be made. But it is your choice; but still, it is simply your life, as is everyone elses, and unless you try, or put effort in at least, then nothing will happen. And in regards to jealousy, everyone is small in these regards, for work, personal time and family call on us enough, that putting effort in to gorw and maintain relationships, is hard enough, that they are truly thankfull for whichever ones they have. So, obviously they are not going to be into you for something casual, but serious. But fear not that there not comparably small; they only have these mere elements though, which your own effort can find.
        </div>
        <div id="beholden">
            We were too beholden to ourselves to see, that some lighter activity and company would help us destress and or decompress. For, when someone pretty comes by, your afraid to let them go, as if theres this massive burden of rest. I must admitt though that there is a person in question, and that we could not be together is not so clear. Only, and I don't mean you made a mistake, but how little effort, or reason rather to come together, was put in? It wasn't as if you spent time together, or ever had. And the fact that your acquaitence is via family, does not seem to suggest further relations. Nor should it be, for this coming together is only so out of formality. The reflection of me is that we have no other genuine interests or support outside of this, naturally if you would in our own life. So when someone comes by, its as if we've be waiting. And, in these cases, you are asked to stop, so you cant putter on with yourself regardless. Such tings are so much trouble, and consequently, the prescence of that other is overwhelming; moreover, are we tuned to see more from them, born out of insecurity or sensitivity (from our lasting abscence). But again, these meetings are circumstantial, and do not proport much affection. "Were family in that respect." Yet, and again your barren base is the cause of this, your taken by them; not inappropriately, but overly. Addng to that is the frequency of this, as these old emtions cause distress at coming occurences. "As if your going to be weighed down by their prescence, one of which you are more than fond of, hoping."
            <div class="qu">And it is your lack of community and friends, or things to expect for yourself, that cause that burden over rest</div>
            Still, there is this weird aspect, whereby the overweighing feeling of their prescence leads you to think they like you. Perhaps, we recede to far into ourselves, and can not see much past what comes in; so, when were talking and it seems nice, we have no other impression than one of interest. But again, I see it as you, being worn, and asked to leave yourself and catch up. And again, this reveals our external shortcomings, for once our own pressures deflate, so do we collapse. And as it were, outer support and its own prescence in your life, would keep your own elements more ample and lasting (through such idle moments); nor would the pulverizing prescence of one so lovely, and its overbearing weight on one who is asked to stand still, would hold less of an effect if you were A) more ample, and B) more set and ordained to something coming.
            <br>&emsp;Theres this weight you see. When others stop by I feel it, like I have to stop, take of my support and bearings, and sit there, while being pleased mind you. The reason though is hard to describe. Its something to do with overinfatuation. But why is that the case? For I believe that itself is caused by that which makes the weight overbearing. Theres something about me which is quite small. In our hands, it is sound and secure, but when spread out becomes very flat. I cannot say that this makes me want the warmth of others more, or, if what warmth they have, causes cannot be gently handled by me; so I recede even futher, almost stubbornly, or I objectify them, as if doing so will relieve their overwhelming prescence. That is the vector, besides our proclivity. At least, their normal prescence compared to our overhlwming vulnerability, causes such a response in their prescence. Its almost like I cannot stop and briskly pace, but have to bear so much incoming brightness; yet, doing so is not my fortey, as being still while active is a hard thing to do. This isn't rest mind you for even that is forward; but rather, letting things go, being unreserved and postured, but still moving, flailing, galavanting. The thing is, I have no still means. Again, this is due to our lack of anticipation or integration: that I've learned, and I recognize our mistake of thinking so harshly that this was irrelevant and unnaccessible. "Church is thee thing in this regard, for it allows a breezy yet connected experience that asks little of you, but you can be yourself -which is to say somewhat postured, considering the polite and respectfull nature of the siutation."
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps that is the main factor here: why can't you let yourself go a little and have some unadulterated fun? This is not why Jen didn't like you; that can be explained througt our family dynamic, and simply not being part of her life. "Why would she like you when you never see her, or expect it to happen immedaitely." I can say though, that seeing as she is quite composed yet fun, bears down on me in a way which I cannot handle. I understand our legacy and why fun is not important or comfortable; but not doing so, has your best times somewhat worn, as well as susceptible to that overbearing effect from having to particiapte in the civil world. For you must wait in line someimtes, or be at work amidst people, or deal with guests and other people coming by. This is natural, nor are you fortunate to be away from this; moreso, your lack of interest reflects your affibility for such scenarios, as their demand for you to let go a little, runs contrary to your interests; yet, if you could more suitably, then you might actually enjoy their prescnece. And that is why Jen and whomever bear down upon me; for I cannot interact with them so lightly, and being so forward has me (and expecting them to be) interested. Yet, they are not so forward themselves, never. In fact, their just recieving your positive energy. Even if it is funny and content, its not natural to think that this will procuur anything more than a floofy pleasure for that moment; it will not last, it never has, people are together because their part of eachother's lives. And that is why it kills you, for you realize this thing, which out of discomfort you ran at and indulged, is not part of your life, is in fact leaving, and you had been so invovled -by virtue of your concentration, but not duration, which is what procurrs the bond of two humors.

        <div id="slack">
            It seems, in plain terms, that we have ourselves, in strenght that is, while we are with not in terms of something special. Yet, there is the glow from the world of men around, and by that, we are secure enough to give. Otherwise, our self-prevalence has us too sensitive to the glare of others, and our wounds are from either hiding or smothering them. But we need this not, for it is only excitment, which remarks little to what you'll actually be doing. Needing this not and being more disposed to the comforts and freedom around, gives me all I need, whereby I can truly be myself
            <br>&emsp;It seems that the lack of incorporation has me somewhat sequestered from a life which is both open and mature. For, in our solo standing, the thought of another, or at least the remission from that prescence (whereby we are back with ourselves) seems to shut this view and feeling of an entirely open and exicting world, into one which is more common, plain, uneventfull and timely. This is what we amend to generally; and weridly, that strict feeling of confidence and imagery, is only so when we switch from connection to not. Its not actually a feeling I've had concretely, for we genuinely aren't connected. Even then, if we are, its usually that which holds my attention and not the world around. Instead, it seems that our truest, or well formed self, has no real place to go, or at least we havne't; but it is this lens, or person we are in seeing, that views the world in all its entirety, and is open and drawn to there being a scope of happenings. "As if we were looking at the entire map of civ."
            <br>&emsp;There is this slack though, for in our softness, or frivolity, we have little view of much beyond the acitvities of that; whereas if we are stout and upright, then more is seen. Only, in procurring that, we've been quite sheltered, or at least centered on ourselves without either the care or (percevied) courtesty from others. As if now, this reserved nature need not be so to be so astute, or filled at least; but I am noticing, or am just accounting, the clear distinction between what we see when we feel like were known and aware (personally), and that of the opposite, when we are forming ourselves and holding ourselves up.
            <br>&emsp;What strikes me is the ability to try, whereby possibility comes to fruition. It seems like the promise of that can level out our regard for the present, whereby we act as though we're already made; yet I am more disposed to advance our genuine efforts and faculties, which seem less so in there guarentee of success, but pleasing in our attempts, for it lenghtens our hold and fairs of those genuine efforts. "Which otherwise become stiff, or otherwise tightened as we try and squeeze out more meaning."
            <br>&emsp;The point, is that there is no problem, at all, that in accepting this I must be vulnerable, in that being so reserved and defensive is not so neccessary, nor do you need to feel so much longing or attachment; in other words, acting as though there are no issues warrants you letting go, which considering your self bound state, explains our aversion. Moreso, there is a pulling string in front, which says that if you are not ill or misfortuned, then for better things you can try, or at least go where your curisoity and intrigue take you; but again, that takes you past what you were holding onto. "And the limit of this, which is why I say vicotry in two weeks, is letting those vacated molds (where defensese lied) to ease from their swelling, and otherwise incorporate the lighter supports from community and activities around. In that sense, your giving yourself a broader and calmer base of support as to allow your essence to overlfow, or fluff rather: but doing so for the moment feels like a removal"

        <div id="younger">
            When I was younger, I felt no real connection or draw to go out there and explore. Better said, it seemd like we were oppertune to try and succeed, for cool things would follow. These weren't my problems though. Instead our parent's were in heated dispute with me, and finding remission in that was the only aim.
            <br>&emsp;Still, when we did go to school, all that had settled, and we were in fact arranged within our studies. Yet, I recall as that first semester wen't on, I felt so depressed, as if the reason for being there was absent. As it would turn out, I returned a year later, happier, more oriented and focus; admittedly, I did not continue my studies from there, but the difference here being that I choose to, for at least I knew it was not for me, while in the former semester I felt burdened to reproach for I had no reason at all. I think the best way to describe this is in saying that due to our conflicts, and even pass their completion, I could not sit and pretend like the purpose of education was solid. I just had no cheer or claim from what they were presumed to offer. Better yet, that even though it was supposedly good and what you were best to do, I had no convergence with that. For as it happened, I sought refuge in myself, treating myself as if that were the responsability. Quickly this blossomed into a great amount care and self regard, blossoming into a unqiuely precise interest in our studies; moreso did we invent sums, which on its own gave some volume to our otherwise private affair. Not since that early period of adolescence have I turned back. For a few weeks some years later I did make a conscious reproach from being so prudent, but even that failed -and in fact ushered me towards further strenght and simplicity.
            <br>&emsp;It just appears that our moat has been dug up, and from its roots we have no position for tradition, custom, values of the norm, nor any specific interest in how the goods of these come to fruition. Life is simply so I need not, nor am I uninterested in my actual living, which owning a home in the common sense neglects. It holds you from moving, demands so much maintence, and really affords you a mere place to input your cash and build an equity; for sure there is some economy in that, but an frugal life itself more than likely comes out further, while needing less. Moreso, a marriage and child are not things to have, but posts to stand in, a duty, a spot where you must be generous. And by these accounts, having come from afar that is, I can see so much more that both feels required of me, but enticing too. If your responsabiltiy is not enough then you have not given yourself, your life or your values enough time and attention; nor, I suspect, have you even maintained them at their richest position, whereby you'd be subject to the pleasures of that. So if a kid or spouse is something you seek, beyond what would feel significant, but rather you think it would cool and exciting, still rest on the notion that this is neither A) what a child is primarily for, as it rests within your duty, nor B) is it the soul peak of what can be otherwise described as rewarding and enlivening, for of that you would find in the paces and days of self regard and responsability. "Your working hands, your gratefull eye, your cheerful mind and honest candor, affords nothing short of a comparable consistency (to how much your well) in your worldview, wonder of people, appreciation for whats enough and the craft of your hands, all so with zero susceptibility to intrusion or ill fortitude." This, at any rate beyond being pleasurable and worth prioritzing right now, makes those bare aims pre-mature, as for me, personally, 'those normal views and interests seem to come from point which feels like its already done.'
            <br>&emsp;For me at least, so much as I would assess at least, in those younger years it seemed like we'd barely started. In fact, it wasn't for most of that time that I saw anything further, nor did I have anything more than the blossoming of that as I brought said newly formed self into the world. Even that though sparked little development, as so much as I wanted to be relieved and enlivened, I still had our inner task at hand. As years went by I read a book by Epictetus, called the Discourses, whereby the actual aim of eveneness, formidity and grace, formed more clearly into me, as if it were the objective. Through the year or two that followed I further read the thoughtfull relfections of Descrates, the worldly histroy by Bertrand Russel, then later on the ledger of Montainges dealing with a similar life, and Plutarchs sweet and kind remedies -of real encouragement and honesty. Seneca too had his mortal day. From thereon, the wairs of being inflammed by the passion of others and praise, stirred me out of place sometimes, but with no avail; for as I found, those things needed their own priorities, and I was unwilling to compramise. "By the time we reached 2020, I had addressed the pure fact that our being happy, delighted and free was enough for me, and that we needed no other headings or furnishments." In addition to that, I would remark of a thought I had some two years later, that although our interest did not solidify into career or human approach, so did we have a course, whereby things would certainly pass by: while all we were to do was steadily and with integrity approach. "And such passer bys would either leave me, whilst we remained, or latch on, but to who I really am -which is the worthiest of incorporations."
            <br>&emsp;On a final note, I will attest to the fact that in this homely place we are, but outside of our prior range. You see, the thing which has felt neccessary all these 8 years long is the practice and respect for our duty and selves. Being at ease while our Mom barks out our door, or being able to listen to my Dad without recompence, brings a calm and admirable cheer to my heart and bones. Moreso, I am happy to have embellehsed in our general thought, to not be taken by flat shades of purpose or governence, and rather humble myself as to the ginormous fact of the world. This has been enough. Yet, infront of this composure has sats treats and gratuities that have colored my time with the most dearest of grandeurs and activities. I cannot say how many times the sun has gleemed with the richest of appeals, or the moon being its own rising event. Nor, can I forgot, when in our lonely times and when the sun was so appealling, that if we were to miss its best we'd be so say, yet, in some years prior we learned and were in awe of its replacment, that being the burnt blue sky, nautical dusk as they call it; nor, on the flipside, was I anything short of content in seeing the sparkling red of astronomical dawn. These are just our days! And to be frank it is not just that which brings light, but that which seeps its vibrance. As high, the clouds delight me, especially once I learned of the nature of highlights and shades. "There just so pleasently in their large tuffness, far away or over the moutains." Locally too, the leaves and shrubbery just catch the light, in a way that brings me to the earth comfortably. Even the smell of the nearby sea helps me settle into there being a world out there.
            <br>&emsp;It is not to hard to feel small though, as times of uncomfort or slack can make these broad insights a soucre for dissapointment. Like that leaving sun, you may feel enclosed in your mind and quarters. Moreso, the nature of this lane is one where friendship is at most what you have, and people otherwise are not often nearby. There is one thing though which has helped, and that is from the notion that, 'if you are everywhere then you are nowhere', which we'll describe as someones interest and intent being set on all but where they are, while on the contrary, 'if you are exactly somewhere, then you are everywhere', which we'll describe someone as steady and pure in place, to the ends that their furthest ability to see does not fail in stretching them, or bringing in longed for desires. In a way, this latter state is one of surrender; and consequently, in their content to seize no bounds, they are both more likely to recieve by their greatfull complexion, nor are they in fear or lust to move, by which the whole can be seen. Reflecting on that previous point, where this latter was not the case, I can see how in those early states my wish was to move, especially when we became unsteadied; yet the result was that, because we simply could not, looking at or thinking about such things I yearned for only brought more despair, for I was here and without, but also lacking what I sought.

            So I've got an interesting idea, or remark we'll say. When I was 10 I was quite happy. Yet, in that moment, I begun to realize that our interests were no longer guided by purity and passion, but with respect to our intentions. This, as it happened, reflected our station to college, whereby we'd go to school, hope to succeed, and find our grown up way.
            <br>&emsp;In my case though, despite doing my fairest to amend, I did not strive, nor exceed. I went to class, used our talents, and, in short, showed up and did what I was told. For in that, we were fine. Initially at first this was especially so for the challenges were lesser, along with the expectations. Once we hit grade 10 though the len's concentrated; nor did our meandering abilities hold the increased scope of late grade school. Our scores began to slip, and what went from an average of As and Bs, turned into Bs and C+. My parents were not so strict, but were keen to hold me with caution. Still, I don't recall and standing issues. Moreover, as the years wen't on, we gained a better grasp on how to do somewhat well, to the point where I got a B in pre-cal and chemistry, socials, science, and sometimes english. So we were fine for the most part, and our course load in grade 12 was small as it was -and we admittedly did a good enough job. At this point though, regards for post-secondary were brought to question. My reply was short, and as it happened, a serious break up had brought me into depression, followed by a series of confrontations with my mom and dad. From the former, I felt so poor as the whole world peeled away; and by the latter, I suspect this was so, that despite having evened out from that former, so had my intent or care for the world run short of educational ambition. This was not critical, or scrutinized for that matter, but my feeling around was that others were leaving me behind. "Even Colin getting his car had me feeling isolated." My point though, as I recall, is that this short change of equity (we had) lelft me feeling helpless, and curbed by being reckless. I can attest to our latter time in the year where our abscences felt harder, yet in this middle portion near the time we graduated, I didn't really care or notice. I had friends and was having fun, and for the most part little demand on me was placed. But smoking, flouting about and wishing my parents were distant, had me neglecting any chance for ambition, nor maintaing (or holding rather) any standard of respect and responsability with my family. What is weird about all of this, is that in my reflections, at least in over an even broader course, I have a principal regret of not going to PMSS, for one, but more seriously and, as it would have been a chance to hold the common angle, I did not go to college starting in my grad year. This could have just been general, and it would have been the right time to get back ahead, join your peers and people on your level, and otherwise form to the common mold. This is not what happened.
            <br>&emsp;Starting in the summer of 2014 I had graduated, and shortly afterwards I was hired for my first serious job. This position was transitioned to a less than preferable role, but there I stayed till the beginning of 2015. The purpose of this job was to keep me sufficient in our 'apparent responsabilities', and otherwise served as what would otherwise be viewed (and judgead) as overly neglegent. There was no issue that we had no spot in college: but we would have a job. I did eventually go to school though: first in that coming winter semester, followed by another in the subsequent winter semester of 2016. These had polar effects on me, as the first showed me that I had no aims, while the latter permitted my deliberate removal. And following this I became quite social, or at least personally settled. I found love, and failed, was employed, but unhappy. I moved out for the first time, changed jobs, and found myself subject the doubts of purpose; not in that I was lacking, but that I could pursue the purpose I had. "As I see it, my aims, no matter how well or not developed, were just to airy and abstract for me to latch on or heed understanding." This resulted in a fairly uncommon stalemate, whereby we were doing all that was asked, but in it I felt nothing. Here though, our beginning lies.
            <br>&emsp;In the land of Metro Vancouver there lived a boy, one who had grown into nothing but himself. As a child he was reminiscent of a real man, glad, cheerfull, a leader, kind. Yet, in his older age where new objectives were set before him, his amendment failed. It is not so that he tried and failed, but that he had no wish to succeed. And as this line of complaceny led him down his growing times, so did the elements present fall between his fingers. He was left out, unkeen to move forward, and had little but to burry inwards, or flounder over an unwanted finish line. At the peak of this though there was someting respectable; for even though his life had faded, and despite having nothing but recklessness, he still committed, to himself. In the fall of 2015 there was a discovery, that if you took two starting numerals and operated them on a repeating number line, so would the sequence repeat. And as he found this a new purpose was discovered, that not only were the self driven amendments worthwhile, but supportive. Having still little room to grow, he decided to return to college, whereby he applied himself and show more diligence. Still, the purpose of this had him begin to wade: but his soul did not fade, and as the admissions for the following semester were open, he decided not to go. Instead, he found a job, met a women, and had his newly worn cleats thrown out. Still, he was a solid forman of cheer, making good impressions at another job, and for the first time feeling unintruded upon. Whether or not he liked it, he would show because he had no choice to, but he also would not for he felt not; and when it was time, he turned in his cap and was ready to go.
            <br>&emsp;The world still felt small to him though, and such confinement had him wishing to go somewhere. Here the story gets tricky, for in his pursuits he found that although being forward and outwardly was beneficial, there wasn't anywhere for his foundations to grow. You see, the world as we see it, is dividied into those who are kids, and those who, upon becoming, grow into adults, who are then asked and quartered into posts (or pre-developments for higher posts) with the aim of acquiring money; and at the very least, work for the sake of running a buisness, feeing a family, housing yourself. These seem like find reasons to stake yourself on some means, for the furnishings evidently are desirable -or neccessary in some case. But Ryan, or the man rather, had little if not no interests in such furnishments; for not only were they in need of their own priorities, but the objectives themselves were not worth sacrificing himself for. For him, the world of physics and philosophy were worth more of an interest; nor were the subjects of everyday writing, leisure and craft short in their desirability. And as it happened, these things required very little; nor were they short of their own required efforts, or without risks from other prioirties compramising efforts. On that account, he took to literary portions of Epictetus, who spoke about living well and sticking to that, regardless of the expense. And, from this origings at least, we can cleanly say that their priorities were ones goverened fro the sake of reason, and such labors were hedged upon their enlightenment and indsutry towards great things.
            <br>&emsp;I have two things to say then. First, is that since we were young when the world fell between our hands, so were we fortuned to have come out on top when our autonomy was its greatest. For if we had broken some years prior, then our point of recovery would still likely have led us to college. This seems fair and pleasent now, but I am not sure if we would have developed a pure and heightened character. I suspect rather, that we would be in a similar position as we found ourselves in the years following, whereby respsonability needed a further stake, or at least a change of one to reflect the interest we had: and my wager is that we would have kept to the former seeing as no other interests would be had, and that through that, an increase progress 'down the corporate ladder' so to speak, would house our meaning and significance. Describing then what path we have and why it is different, is fairly done so in those pre-secondary years; where, as we said, the onest placed on us was to be responsible, but the purpose of it held no other reason than to relive any feeling that we were poor in contrast to others, or that we were letting our parents down. There never was something in particular that I wanted to do; nor did I care, with positivity that is, about retirement, owning a home, or any idea of marriage of sorts. These concepts felt like common furnishings, but held no place as any heart or matter. The point is though, that whereas other people may hit the contrary side of gluttony, we simply were sufficiently amended. "Even though it never felt like our head was above water." And as it was our fortune, so did ceratin events in those later high-school years pull me into a negative tailspin, in part because we had no other forward momentum. Consequently, when we were given chances to move forward, I had to little movement to either feel like, or find it worthwhile. What I feel then was the heart of this course happening, or coming to further be rather, was that sincer we were not keen or endited to the realm of gluttony, we were otherwise left with the nothing of our ways. Like a fire beneath you, something bound us to rise. Coming out of this lethargy and indiffernece, we were curious; and in that came self-respect and a cleanse of indulgence. From here we garnished ourselves as a genuine scholar; and depsite being so idly fundemental, we did discover sums. And for whatever reason, all conflict was depleted, and despite having very few (if not one friend) or any money and vectors for fun, we were convinced, or pleased even, with our efforts and our focus: and I recall quite clearly, that such a time held nothing short of contentment. Moreover, as I'd reflect from this current day, that nothing has ever felt out of sort when we were like that: and is it were, I have grown to accept the elements of such description as being the preferable parts: for in them there is regularity and acceptance. Yet that last portion has been the hardest aspect to constantly come. For we are in this state now, of contentment, and describing it as so is but a mere whiff of our plainest days; most of them, and increasingly this feels to be so, are beyond such evens but of satisfaction to, or joy we'll say. And if we are trying to paint this picture that reflects all those yearly pieces of the puzzle, you must consider the place of each one as a part of that means for contentment, and the opposition which is tradition. For in that, we had expectations, hopes, dreams and aims that reflected both a self importance, and a need for validation. Yet, as time went, so did all those outward glimmers settle, and we instead sunk deep into our soul. As it happens, every millimeter is counted, and, as it happens, like an earthquake even the most minor of changes feels like a mass push. But this has been maturities pace, as the more she grows into you, the more she seeks you being honest. For it was in your accounting that you found her, and slipping in your awareness and attention equally splits her off your side. Consequently though, the years have offered even more refinement, for as months go by and we begin to slip, we install some patchwork and keep our best self going.
            <br>&emsp;As it happens, the course of my life has left me with a reflection. Simply, the practical matter is that you cannot outwardly go; that is, if you feel that 'I finally have, some real cementing, our figure is full in place and we can be sincerely outward', then you've lost your principal style. For who you in sincerity, is not someone with the aims of warmer habition, or glory, touring and fame. We are a man, of that we have interests. But the point worth rising is that this takes both time and committment. For if you let yourself wander into the corporate realm, then your originality will spill out and leave you like most people who really just want a means to establishment. Yet, in that hope for rest, which is to say that you have what it is you need to live, that the real aims and purpose that would come from such rest, are gone, for the actual objective which sought to even you out, washed out any of those liberal purposed: and you conseuqnrly just wish to further grow. And perhaps otherwise, the only thing to keep you in line, is in remembering your interests, and let your problem solving nature glow.

            When you are kids, your bunched up together and find according bonds. Effectively though, a friend is one who you can then do something other, after school perhaps. This is similar as it is in work places, or sports even.
            <br>&emsp;What I find weird is that what you need to do, or at least the rafters of our lives, really dictate the groove of our connecton. For if everyone is working has not much else they'd do but drink and comfort, than those are the strands for you to connect on. Simply, if our buisness is regarding the ease from death, the care for activity over station, and the removal of what something is for -namely the raising of kids- then our mold for overlap is smaller.
            <br>&emsp;It has always been the case that things intrigue. Whether I was with somebody or on my own, I was fairly contented. The difference being that I'd play sports with others, and otherwise bring them to play games and watch televions -which I'd do contendely otherwise by myself. When I got older though, despite remaining content with gaming, the overlap began to shrink outside of anything akin to ball hockey, and had more counts in drinking. This was fine, but of uninterest me. Nor was this an isolated problem, as I knew a fair few people who would not go out and do such things; yet I feel like some of them would hang out, and like children, watch movies and play games.
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps my story is not so sad, for the pressures that sprouted near the edge of childhood forced to see the world as a hostility; and although I cared not to proceed where I could through an amends, I did see it as neccessary, as if we were merely dealing with a threat. By those accounts, I never sank into those groups of people who in fact shared interests, but rather I gazed and criticiazed those 'partier folks'. There was always a part of me that did not like anyone, like they were stupid and I was better with no need of them. But this mere complacency burried me as grade school came to a close; for the weight got heavier, our relative means did not fully stack up, confrontation ensued, and all but being reckless and yearning for yonder was present.
            <br>&emsp;There just was no life in me ever to want to contribute; or at least when it came to the duties I had, I could never see pass what would avoid me the consequences of ignorance; but I did not strive, and as it happened, I failed to connect. I've written about this before, but this was not due to other people shunning me, but rather me putting in no effort. In part, was because I had no keeness for what it was for. I was emberrassed infront of my parents regarding a girl who liked me; I felt inferior in English 10 for having nothing to say (amongst those who did); even hearing someone in grade 11 have a nice plan to learn about being an architect, had me seeing someone (being me) as poor in comparison. Everyone went off, and only those who I knew close remained.
            <br>&emsp;What occured though is that I revelled in the pursuit of happiness. What I cared about were games, reading, sunsets, and what this required was mere self regard and attention. This made me quite happy and collected: though the interest for me to go to college, or have a career even, took time to whither out -or to be accepted that I had no path towards that I mean. This resulted though in a seperation between my two close friendships. In the first, my longest friend was bumming around; he was employed, but smoked alot and had no active interest in him; this was fine, his own being, but I could not take part in it. I told him that we could no longer be together while those aspects were saturated within him, then left. With the other, he had similar cares as I did regarding self improvement (for instance) and we held a secure partnership for the years to follow. As it happened though, the road bent between us, and the our intention and ability had to bear itself towards the normal path or ourselves; he took the utility and strenght he conjured and applied it into a programming profession, while I took further refuge in my heart and soul. Even, as it were, as this divied began to happne, we still were friends for many years, but from a distance. He'd call me out of the blue and we'd talk for hours, sometimes about our according lackings, other times to simply boot up and play a game together. It has been some time since I've heard from him. And although I consider him to be my equal, at least in terms of prioritizing personal attention, he has no purpose or aim. That is for his own discretion though.
            <br>&emsp;So now, as it happens, I really prefer the peace and freshness of happiness, and I hold no regards past inhabiting this. This means that I don't go drinking, nor do I text much, nor do I yearn for gatherings and bantering. An effect though is that there are very few people who cross my path of living. Increasingly has this been the case for passing stranges, who are less present to talk to; nor, has there been ever really, anyone remotely on my level, or in the same space at least. Not even barely, outside of those who had good fitness levels in college. Even that though faciliated little, for I was not simply attending to myself as to further my abilities for the common end, but heralding an aim which was other, or at least a set of priorities which reflected the means for what I sought to do. There's these roots though. And weidly, the rot between them is this discontent at presenting when there is unhappiness: and this genuinely coincides with people visiting. For they want to sit and talk, yet I do that on the floor; nor is it really but an average catch up, and in that I have nothing but solid things to share. "And I hate doing so, so casually." I just don't have many interests, at least I have few moments or occasions worth sharing. My entire day is built on temperence and virtue, and my joys come from industry and going outside. Its not exactly too special, and that makes it draining when someone comes by. Still, I have realized that theres room for us to be more forward; for getting together to talk more literally, is pleasing. I must remember though, that not everyone is either so keen or available. But you can at least take refuge in knowing theres room for connection. Nor do these continous refletions leave me without quainter means of describing our interests. "I must admitt though, that it isn't always ripe within me to share that my soul interest is to be a dancer; and that doing so is simple, and that wherever oppertunity is, I only attest to detail: which as it happens, marks the fact that most things that would reflect my interest, are too tailored towards our money making ends, and not enough of the activity, which leaves me less than enthused to participate or committ."
            <br>&emsp;There just hasn't been enough time whereby we new our freedoms, and could decipher the code of creation. Consequently, there has been much more time through our growing autonomy, where the aims and interests had less solidity to share; and unfortunately, I feel like I've been stained with anathema, whereby I appear uninterested. In many ways thats true, but deep in our core is this wonderfull person: and in that, on occasions, I hope to share. Again though, some people, or in most ways all people in a good chunk of instances, care less about having a serious convo, but prefer rather to relax and laugh instead. "At least in a yackity sense."
            <br>&emsp;I just want everyone to realize that I am ok. For there are times when my own life could be talked about, and about theres too. This is a fair feeling, as it is not either cynical or of abscence. I realize though that not only is this the case, that our life has been different and continues to be so, but that there may be less room than you'd hope to bring your new stability to fruition. For even if I had all the money in the world, and invited someone to be with me on a sincere adventure; only if the elements of that were to their liking would they remain; for they may otherwise not seek to be so reserved and thoughtfull, or collected at least. Nor are they about to leave their own posts, despite your offer. And again, where interests come to mind, so are theres different, in that they clearly have higher ambitions, or responsabilites no less. And temperence is not given much value when compared to outings and comfort. Which again, is fine, for I am merely outside of the doors to that; and I am not seeing if I can come in, but rather if someone wished to come out, and sit outside. They need not come to our lands, nor ought I feel disrespcted or ignored if there time is prefferred indoors; but we can have that interest in mine. For they will sometimes look out the window and see you resting there, which may not excite them, but at least they know your here, desptie being different.

        <div id="approach">
            I suspect that we have a problem. For some reason, intelligence has never prompted me to treat anyone differently, anything special. This is great, for all are your friends, none are you enemeies. There are those who strike you though. And this has always been a nervous debilitation for me. I can love, I am sincere, and am always happy take: but I cannot tell someone how I feel. Part of this is due to our recessed intelligence, whereby the world is our awe, and we are with enough liberty to treat it. As it were, 'I wish I did not like you, for it appears more like a distraction'. Practically though, our feelings never show, and we either avoid them, or feel hindered as we are unfufilled elsewhere. The problem, is that I know that we must approach them, pay attention, offer them something, and hopefully attract. But I don't, I simply don't want to, theres more that treats my eye. And this was simple, and in fact, our natural presentation of this led others over time to flock around me. Yet when I got older and we were short in other's familiarity, this could not happen. I regret not going to Pitt Meadows, but the reasoning was fair; I did not care for those who I had now met, for all I saw in them was this primal attraction; and of those things which aroused our intelligence, there was no room. So I hung out with nerds and what not. Where this really comes to bind is that when we were somewhat pressed out of what I'd prefer and we were set down the line of discipline, the fancy I had for others couldn't be easily ignored. I would think of them, and poorly as other habits dirtied my mind. And still, there was always this defensive positioning I had, like they were stupid, and caring about them was wrong. It just never seemed right. So when someone did like me, for my irreverence, I didn't bite, despite feeling the same. For as it happened, there was no room, or meaning behind me, when it came to what would otherwise seem true and proper.
            <br>&emsp;The difference between this while we were older, is that before when we were young we had few respsonabilities, and a great deal of excitement was there; I was fine to ignore it and attest to those things. "Perhaps I could have invited them over, but the rules were not in mind." No matter, as we got older and those excitements vanished, I felt so preserved to care for them and not some other. During those early years when I was the center, I suspect that when we got older and responsability to our place, that we would expereince the same thing, or over-deliver on what we were suppose to do, and be a leader of sorts. That aspect is unclear, as I am not sure what I was suppose to do. In way, it remarks the fact of our bearing now. For I don't believe that we are subject to ridicule as our predilections hide us away. But what were you to do, in grade 6 had you stayed, or in grade 8 through 11? In a some sense, my recommendations from now, would be to focus on the duties at hand, clear what they were, how to operate them, and their purpose as to limit their extent, then remain and propser in their privilage and profits, for those things which were important. This bogged me for years in my development, for I had no respect or care for the portrait of college, work, our future and retirement on display.
            <br>&emsp;Where I lie though is in a wake of desecration. For I did not priotizie those real goods, and instead I wafted my way amongst the prescribe persistence. I did not strive, nor did I surivive for my benefit; and from that rose depression. For, when I did in fact get a girlfriend, and when, after years of permitting myself to accept our condition, I found the angles of it which I like, my still ill-suited timing -whereby they recieve as little effort, like a real good should- brought me away from them, smearing through and amidst the seperation. From then on, we remodelled, bringing ourselves back to both our aims, and their real means. I admitted years later that despite the needs for these goods, there was still a requirment for me; and by that, I submitted myself to the meagerest of labors, listening to my father, forgiving my mother, and otherwise flourishing with the simple reality of this committment, and using to paint our world with spades.

            Pleasure is not ordinarily something that you are lacking. It be something sweet, or a treat on consumption, but generally you are never in a state where its missing. Similar to sugar though, the craving is there, or at least theres part of you overly saturated with the desire. People, to me, feel the same, in that they offer so much comfort and security, that your experience with this prior to abandonment, feels like a real loss. For we had so much then had so little. People are not objects though, and seeing as the love we have is overflowing and ready to shine, so are we not clear to treatment: particulalry without following the rules.
            <br>&emsp;What I see is that reason, or circumpsection, relieves us from worry or stress. Consequently, we have our own inner glow, and a portrat of reality which is constant, brimming, wonderous and new. Such a scene brings a merriment of cheer and excitment, the ease to settle into what you have, the appreciation of all that inherintly gives you security, so that you can marshel yourself, as if a dance, in taking nature's hand: whereby your movement and steps marks the marvel in your heart, the peace in your bones. Someone by your side would surely improve this, as a one man play is harder than multiple; but looking at the others around, and what lines they have and moves they make, its babble; or at least, they don't see what I see in, and in a way cower under incoming rays. I can help them though, or at least carve out a means and place to experience such awe and grace.
            <br>&emsp;In fact, that is what I am doing. Youtube is a stage like no other, wherbey I've taken my elements, folded them into the according designed, and performed them. Some people have walked by, a small few of them have turned their heads with curiosity. But I, just want to take our steps, and, to be clear, in a true and formal way. Theres something different about singing in the shower, and that on a stage. Even if its a little dump down an alleyway, people are their, listening, no matter if they hear you. And there I stand, putting ourselves out-there, soothing the built up joys and strenght within me.
            <br>&emsp;There is rot though, for although this color in me has come from the draw of life of nature around, so were we once closed off. Moreose, were we absent from these hues and power while privy to another interest: but, while serving that, we were small, frail, a failure. This in fact drove me to simpler recess', whereby minor inquiries surrounded a large internal formatting; even then though, the world spoke out to me, however relatively small. I still was charmed by it, safe, simmering those elements which we now find so dear. I say rot though, because in these middling days, we grew emotional surrounding people and claims, which spoke to me as remedies of our grinding experience. Moreover, I was not so mature and consistent in dirtying our mind and habits. Our long combinded with such filth held me hostage, sometimes bodly, towards comforts and remission of our empty existence. Even when we reproached, the walls were someone shorter, or closed around us, and a combination of our inability to not be overwhelmed and the social pressure to get outside them, burnt those prior ambitions, or lusts to say the least, into our aims and attention. "In other words, our interest in how we were had too little room and sustenance to feel fully stable or comforting; so, we held both a contriving eye on what we would do to move on farther, as well, as a guarentee, or expecation and hope no less, that others would come by and bow at our side."
            <br>&emsp;This did not happen though, for as I see it, we held no longing interest for those grounds of ambition, and accordingly our efforts there punished us as we tried to earn her favors. Girls did not fancy me, directly or following our glaring approach, nor did we make much advancement in glory or praise. As this occured though, we only went further into ourselves; and as this was cemented during the spring of 18, we saw that this was no means, but the way itself, whereby respsonsability would be taken, for the reward of freedom and her gaze. This was hindered though by our rusted nature at the time; and despite having little on our hands, I wanted to throw out the entire platform: and if I am confessing, 'live outside'. This did not work however and I was instead humbled to find more respectable ways to habitate the working world.
            <br>&emsp;This itself is a mighty insight, for it reveals this commisorate nature the way things are. Our needs are few but are there no less. Outside of nobility and elites, you are privy to participate in the work that provides -and they stand on. If it were older times, we may live in a small group, hunting and foraging, convening together. Or, if times were more civil, someone other might farm the food while you have another post, whereby you build goods or offer services: in other words, your a member and user of an economy. This is where things get tricky, for an economy more or less provides food and shelter to all those participating in it; at the very least, the quality of what you get is more than those living in the wilds. "It is worth noting that some people in the former live in shambles, while those in the latter live in well-adapted ways, nonetheless though." Immediately I will strike down a root cause of this problem, for in this economy we are molded to work. Simply, if you have a child, who is a person like you and I, then, at the very least beyond whats special and priviliaged, shelter and food will suffice for you to servive. What I feel happens is that people buckle over to get lucrative spots in the economy, so that they can either have more, or provide more: I simply want to remove the worth of that latter, as what is in itself worth providing, does not require a position that allows you to do it much. Your child is, against nature's odds, born for the same as yourself: and if you are fine with food and shelter, then so will they across time be as well.
            <br>&emsp;my point though, is that although a small amount is needed for someone, a position to acquire this is needed. And such a fact caused me trouble, for life felt boring, distant, and somewhat privy to those old emotions and ambition. I still accepted this though; as those prior committments to virtue and freedom became my aim, so was I carefree and constant in our civil resolve to merely achieve that. Doing so gave me both the confidence I needed, and a regularity of this which furnished our now opened and steady gaze: "Here the stars really opened up to me, as did the sun, moon and clouds; literature also spoke so clearly, along with a deeper mind and fruition for art, gaming and film. Our health exploded, along with the breadth of curious mind. We travelled around the hills and flats, holding that as the body of our country. To the end I hope that lasts."
            <br>&emsp;This was near the spring of 2020 for reference. And as I had become un-intruded by others and more willing to offer my mind (in late 2016) so was this a new era on that. We were a man, apt, calm, heartfelt and with motion. All was near, and pure. What was dear though brought an ugly side, as upon our saturating heart came colorfull products. Speaking with people was done so with so much humor and delight, that I enjoyed it so well. But, life in these ways was not absent of pressure, for normal reasons primarily. From that, people were a draw, as however well angled we were in this simple scenario, it still had bars, and people woudl either A) help remove them, or B) heal me in coping. This did not occur. Despite our emotional appeal, people did not reply. There place was elsewhere, likely to where they either say more promise and personal remedy, or at least those they shared more in common. This overstep has happened several times, once being quite recent. What I mistake, is that others, despite being behind bars, are not so ready or arranged to have them be so small, and otherwise remove them for reaon's sake; instead, their confinement is larger, housing more elaborate means for relief, along with more common means of gratification and comfort. We did not meet this. Moreoso, it was not apparent that this was so; so even if it now makes sense, we still let ourselves become interested, as if we thought they would be also. On top of that was a bit of flattery, or self obsession, whereby, amidst all these normal people and their struggling ways, you had a man in me, and in this civil duress we could thrive beside eachother; yet, I thought we were so special, in not only beleiving that we were ordained for someone seeing as who we are, but that they would be so taken back by that, infatuated from our character and cheer. But their not, nor do they seem set for it. We are just getting off this, for in the time that's followed we've materialzed a course and aim for those things which draw us, turning our respone into an objective. Still, in this we have shared but little, and then overestimated other's interests. And that is quite hard. What I see is that there is that rot that has me with pernicious vulnerabilites; for, even now that we have so much weight and focus from our heart, it is still strung together with knots and failed appeals. Other people seem desirable to me now in ways that, past our interest, seem more welcoming and tuned to exagerate. This is perhaps due to our fear of being hidden, which itself comes being more private as we further prioritize. "Even though our course is accepted, theres still a life which is inspired and contribtues, who's details are unknown and hard to share. As I recede into those, I feel less known and accepted, and thus distant." Although, I must mention the fact that, old fancies really draw this out, as upon their return I suspect were passing an oppertunity by, which has my riling up and contriving a scenario where we can pounce. Yet it never was so, you simply misinterprated. Our mind did embellish though, and their prescence had me thinking, dreaming, somewhat objectiviting; reality is harsh though when you realize that you are neither here to abandon yourself, that they never saw you that way, and that for them to, the former would have to be true: and of all feelings I hate most, is being torn. "For reason hides in her shell a little, as does her glow cower its gaze. Disposition molds me though, as do we understand the extent to which either our fancies or obsession require for us to achieve them: which I will not do, for their or my own sake."

        <div id="sofar">
            So we graduated highschool in June 2014. Soon after we found employment as a car washer, and held that job till the start of next year. From then, we attended our first stretch of college, then worked privately during the back part of the year. Here, we formed sums, a formal love for health and nutrition, and otherwise repelled from normal ambitions and success; though, we did contain some hopes and wishes, of a normal kind mind you, but from our newly sorted selves. In 2016 we returend to college, taking Biology, Calculus, Critical Thinking and Intro to Academic Writing; this went over better than the prior year, but our tenancy was not established. We have since then not returned.
            <br>&emsp;In that spring we worked for a month as a sandpit raker, then switched to painting for that summer. In Septmeber we were hired at Save-On Foods to work in the deli, and we did in fact make sushi. Here we stayed till April of next year, whereby we moved in March to Coquitlam. In June we found a job as a produce associate at Walmart, and stayed there till the summer of next year. After moving twice, in November and February 2018, we had took to philosophy, reading Epictetus' Discourses, and finding a love and content with well-being. Our hope was to live outside as to remove neccessity, but the weather proved difficult. In August of 2018 we moved home, and re-established our way. At first we had begun dabbling in Illustrator, but the career ambition of this fell through. Instead, from the end of that year through the spring of 2019 we began seriously writing, about history formost. This grounded me in our self worth and value. And we were quite confident, feeling good and ready to do something serious; so we choose a personal training program set for the summer. We went there for three months, aced the test, had several interviews, but with no success. Personally, I did not want to follow through with this. Instead of bringing our selves all prepped and true to the table, we had fallen under the load leading up to the course exam, and upon finsihing, we had little energy or enthusiasm. So, with a little more to muster I could have found a job, but our own shortcoming had me back off. "For doing it like every other way, felt unexciting."
            <br>&emsp;During the beginnings of that fall, I spoke with my dad, who told me I had to get a job, period. I was content and happy with our writing and ways, but our place in life had no body or bearing. So, after much protest, I obliged. I got a job as a personal shopper at Superstore, and fell right into its arms, as a job no less. I must admitt though, that working there was a strain on my humility, for I thought myself set for things better, and, admittedly, was trying through the winter to think of or contrive a way out of there. As Covid began in the following spring, I began to settle into our position there, recognizing that despite its labor and small oppertunity, it provided me with the time and freedom to do as I pleased; and we were accepted as feeling so. Through the summer and fall I stayed there, learning about love and repsonsability; I also wrote more formally, though in small bouts.
            <br>&emsp;As the fall came to be though, I felt a hanger to refocus and atttend to our private matters and self. I gave my resignation in October, and have not been back since. Through the winter I was somewhat lazy and feckless, though our thoughts and creativity were of a higher caliber. A serious of vicious fights with my parents had me reassessing where I wanted to go, or at least what I was doing. At this time still, I felt these concerns were superfluous, for I was merely being and writing right now, and I could move out, but to no conclusive end; it was merely about where I was, and no place wouldn't be fine. In the spring though, I choose to move to Vancouver, or nearnly as it would be. In May we placed all our stuff in a house far away. From then till the end summer I did not see my parents, but a single time. In this spot I was electric, or at least confided with the scenery and novelty of it all. As it happened, we became complacent, and as it would seem, resulted due to a lack of purpose. We found wonderfull imagery and went on holy walks, but not so often if I am being honest; and our time otherwise devovled into something comparable to our second house in coquitlam, whereby we were settled and put, yet idle, or at least aimless, leading to a mix of indulgence and impression. While I was there I had the ultimate aim of getting another job at Superstore, just to find some structure (out of neccessity too), but our Mom and Dad asked me to come home while they went on a road trip in Septemebr. This did not happen, but as the tides went, we still came back.
            <br>&emsp;From here my life becomes more than just positive. You see, our earlier years of adolescence saw me without any place in the world, but pleased about our self sufficiency. Even as we went forward, there was all potential. As time went on though, the actual place or ability for us to be ourselves in a proper way was small, or at least I felt cynical about the spots available. Still, we lost this desire to remove all neccessity so we could simply be ourself, and we reporached more inwards, making that the goal. This did not build much outer regard, and our task to be somewhere was present; but we accepted this as so, while growing on the inside; and as that inner glow found reason to be in a laborous place, we were contented. Still, the activity of part time work felt empty, however passive and a support to what I enjoyed. The problem, was that part of me which was so vibrant and alive, had little to color with, or to rather. The nagging feeling behind me in those days was not so much that this work was bad, but that we had no where else to go that would feel more pleasing to contribute towards. In other words, stabiliy we were happy, but our inner self had no meaning: and flourishing felt, outside of quality, small in its substance. As the novel attempt to live in Vancouver came to a close, the idea of being more objective came to play. At first our plan was along the lines of programming, as found some favor in what it would allow me to do; otherwise, the creative effort required for it seemd acceptable, and thus the possibility of finding better work and meaning was accessible. This, although fine in itself, transitioned into our own use of programming, which paired with our sprouting writing at the time, led me to build a website for ourselves. At first it was basic, but began to fill up, eventually reaching a point which was packed with a bounty of essays and prose. I did have this feeling like being online would mean we were exposed, but our site was in no way opitmized, nor of much importance after a while that it would become so. We were learning, sharing with our parents, and the words and ideas themselves began to blossom. In fact, their aspects levelled our committments, giving way to dearly being ourselves. For not only were we pleased with what we were doing, but the rush to go out there or the fear that often caused me to recede within, vanished away as the unproblematic advance of time was established, whereby we could simply be ourselves and let our nature flourish, to whichever end or way. This was quite nice and gave no haste or worry as we focused on ourselves and writing through the summer (of 2021). Mom and had moved to Kamloops in the spring and we to central Vancouver. I can account though for the fact that even though the body of our inner selvles began to grow and we had much to say, the idea of placing presenting this still was held under traditional ideas of success. "There was still this worry about what would happen, and that what we were doing was only fit for a certain lane; yet, to do so, required so much and, fairly so, seemed unimportant to address unless you were throughing yourself entirely in." And I had no impetus to do either, and was fine to let our work gradually expand -and then find more simple routes and ease into a presented formatt. We got a job at superstore, were more sociable and promising (in our elations), and all was generally well. Our objective view from writing really came to fruition in the fall, and although I still had reticent feelings about going somewhere with it, the base was filling, and more or less readying to go where I wished it.
            <br>&emsp;Then my dad got sick, or at least was told he was sicker than he knew. In retrospect there was someone I cared for and the scenario I was in was held a healthy kind of activity; but my mom and dad invited me to come home, which again, was fair as my dad was deemed sick, and my abilities were needed; but as it happened he was in not so dire straits. Still, his life is depleting, despite not being on the edge of a cliff. And as it were, we settled into Kamloops, found comfort in the peace and fresh air, and otherwise grew rich in our leisure and writing, as well as reading and study, exploded in our industry, whereby we made a high tier website for the writing so far (and other ornamentas of my life), along with actually drafting a printing a copy of our writing in the form of a book. so far from the summer of last year (when I had moved to Vancouver, in 2022) I have written 500,000 words, 300 of them being before the print of my book this May, and 200 thousand after (till now). And now we are arranged in the greatest sort of industry, a real display, a far speaking presentation. On youtube we have posted and scheduled a massive batch of battlefield videos (all being in shorts), which, in following, will be headed by the mightestest assortment of writing and study fragments, all voiced through crisp text to voice, and subtitled for an easy listening experience. On top of that, is another edition of our book, which will cut out uneccessary parts from the first, and add the best entries from our summer and fall writing. These will follow our literary treatments, and perhaps be treated similarlry, or be done so in their whole setting (where each essay is kept whole, rather than fragmented). And although I see a similar approach to history and science, or film for that matter, I see an even richer place for our musical pallete, where, to attribute James Cornell, 'songs you like can be assessed and commented on, with a fair amount of time and space to reference them, in audio'. This is where were going, and I am beyond anticpation, but excitment, for I not onyl see what I can and would like to do, but what I'd love to do; and the effort and response to our channel so far brings this oppertunity to light, and thus my cheer.
        </div>

        <div id="further">
            I would define ourselves like this. We wish to move, and do so readily, and often. But, when it comes time to stop, we cannot, and we push ourselves further. This has better outlets though, as doing less through the day comes easy when there's stuff to do outside. But, if we have to host or socialize, it feels like were moving while still, and that is quite deflating. Surrounding this, is the wish for external relief, as if we could purely be ourself, while taking in incoming warmth. This is flawed though, as no one is keen on doing such, nor lacking somewhere more appealing. This is where church comes in, or some other activity; as, you can anticipate going, decompress while your there, in that you can still move despite being of a less severe kind; then, if you must come to a halt for tougher things, you'll be used to rest, or relaxed rather by those more active (or communal) treatments.
            <br>&emsp;And so I recognize our inability to sit still, particularly while social, makes such incidences a threat; and, particularly, we are asked to do these when theres someone we know, such as Jen or a close relative. Otherwise, we are seeking, or have expectations at least, that such person will place their attention on us; and so we feel like there's an opportunity being missed otherwise. Then, when we realize their not, we struggle to show up anyway, for there is never enough to do that a moment of rest doesn't come, yet were without much depth in that, for we have had no attention or relation outside of this. "Our crush seems lingering around."
            <br>&emsp;Cutting to the front, I can see that others think of things they'd like to do, and in general compare and share with others: they then work for the sake of that. I, in contrast, seek more efforts within industry, leisure and craft. This is a purely active lane, though for practical reasons. Whereas those adventures and gatherings cost money and the according priorities, our active time is limited only by our means to be generous. By that, we are always moving, and quite comfortably too, as the world sits peacefully, in its common way that is, while the gentle padders and chatters of man breathe a general solidarity. The world in this way feels earthen and fine. Yet, we have limits in this kind of place, for you can not always do the most; or, at least, you must come to a more casual state of motion. "For I believe that some movement is always required, even in the strictest rest, but the amount of concentration and gruff fluctuates."
            <br>&emsp;Personaly, our life has grown in a way that our focused time has born all prevalence, and our fortunes to novelly (and easily) proceed outside of this have not reached a point where they can sustain our lower efforts. So we wear ourselves out, or feel depressed. The lesson though, or at least to reflect on the mistake I've made, is that I have not found somewhere that I can just be myself, in that the environment is catered to you directly, whereby you can at your leisure throw yourself in. Normally, we have to make up all the time and effort; but again, when were out and able and pleased to do only minor things, so can we feel stalled. Friendship and community can offer this, as church for instance allows someone to go somewhere, unwind and meagerly focus, then return to a more well set and rested place. We do not have this; and the reason is more or less because we felt afraid to be ourselves, and otherwise we hoddled our concentrated efforts with explicity. Consequently, times where we had to rest amidst social customs, or some one familiar stopped by, we felt put off by the fact that being so happily arranged, while still (as converse generally asks) made me feel terrible. Moreover, or at least born from this, is the increased emphasis on other's interest in you. "As if we lived on our private corner, and someone would be enticed to come in." Again, their neither interested or available to do so.
            <br>&emsp;We just have to be more reliable, for our comfort zone and pent up self importance can shue us away from those lighter things, amidst our conviction that someone will want in. "As if were warranting our privacy." When I look at what I need though it is not more things to do, as these, in my view, are excitements that promise comforting rewards for those with higher obligations. "As they cannot see behind, in the lands of peace and reason." We, on the other hand, just need some lighter activities, with the ease and nourishment from being social, communal and or friendly. Yoga in the park is a measure of this, as is church and spiritual open houses. These are present in most communities and can serve as a regular point to refresh and communicate. "Which is why they call them services." I will drive to these, or I will scooter, which itself makes the whole thing wholesome in its pleasure. "Thinking of our time in Vancouver, I can just see how many churches and spiritual gatherings there'll be within our scooter's range; even then, we can still bus, or walk even, for the worth in question." It's just something to have while you continue to be yourself. For although I know that everyone is occupied, and otherwise uninterested in idolizing me, so am I still content with being myself, focused, pure. I just don't need to increase the pressures around that, 'as if to remedy our in fact loneliness, or lack of things to otherwise do'.
            <br>&emsp;This is a mistake: we have been ill forward and unresourceful. There is no need for this, you can take your solid line, and brand it with those communal pleasures, using communication to possibly make a friend: or at least establish the reason for you being there. "Which can lead to more restorative motions, and the peaceful course that comes from, as you earn more to proceed under focus, and without any fear of doing so, but happily as you can: for of those things which are in themselves preferable and lighter, so do you know that they are there." Since, in the end, all I ever sought was something like that. "Which in Jen's case, was only that she'd know I was there"
        </div>
        <div id="noticed">
            Wherever you are, you can see, and wherever there is, you can be. But, in my recollections, I am noticing that as we loose ourselves, so do we notice the seperation between us and those around. These are thoughts to difficult to define perhaps -in our drunken state at least. But I do have a model. It remarks that ancient notion, or knowledge I have at least of Socrates and Diogenese, even Auerlius, and their ability to prosper and thrive in and of themselves. Only, in their time they had to herald their inner ability, for that is what kept them upright. The notion, akin to dark energy and radiation comes into play, whereby the lack of pressure from without, of a direct kind at least, gives less push from yourself, which upon lacking leaves you crippling and imploded.
            <br>&emsp;On a similar note is the fact that our whole life, or adolescence at least, we have been expecting people to cross by and notice me. Through this we sought places where there was more traffic (so to speak); this, was paired with our own sense of shine, and how we just needed to show up to be noticed. There is some truth in this, but clearly, or at least I can admitt, that we were not so present. We invited little or shared much, so none could even see. There is that indifference mind you whereby the treatment you get is from entirety, but so in our shorter ways do we need more from people, or community at least; for in that, we have some outward pressure, which our lighter fashion can dance with. What happened though, is that had little from without, and thus pressured ourselves, or focused at least, on refining the world within it. But this only made us tighter, especially considering our natural imperfections. This is the model at least, and I can point to the fact that we are lacking things from without, that they are not unfair to have or liable to remove yourself in approaching.
            <br>&emsp;I do want to remark on ourselves, for in it I see our ability to be. As it were, it seems favorable to be present and graced with all the world around. I see other people with fears outside of them, but console themselves with closer fortunes and relations. Our mistake is in forgoing ourselves to a perfect tee, but then expecting ourselves to do so, as if gradually; yet, both the accounts were off as were our resoltions, whereby in our state following msitakes, we dug further in. This did not benefit us though, nor was it for a reason worth amending, but fear and dishonesty. At any rate, we would be better off to procceed with decency, and our strain and hobbling in a way worked against that. I understand your roots and the natural fear and wearinss of being outwardly bold, but so is this fine, or a mark of discomfort as opposed to an ill-fit. Moreso, on a general scale, we are welcomed to places where it is more appropriate to be so sound and bold, in church namely or other groups of the sort. This seems enough for me, as we have more room to settle into ourselves without the risk of implosion -or further strain. Doing this to, can invite novel friendships, pleasure and fun, oppertunity even. "The privilage of trying, as you are plump in your constancy and security."
        </div>
        <div id="today">
            So I live with my mother and father, and our relationship is quite good; so much so, that their biggest ask of me is to simply do more, to try and live as though we are without bounds. As it were, I have held to tightly to myself, waring myself out and opening myself up to wrong hopes and wishes. Still, my parents have been supportive, even during our private ways. My sister is nice to me and I to her; in fact we had a genuine conversation recently, and I mean to check in with her -and share whats going on with me. Surrounding me are relatives, though they hardly come by. And although we've just been acquainted, there is the community and warm welcome of Shambhala and the United Church; as well, theres more to come, with the Buddhist Church, Coffee zoom chats, yoga sessions (particularly yin), and other meetups and acitivies that we come across. Overall, these things give me a great resonance of prioritiy, security and cheer. Having such allows me to rest and not feel so idle; in tanget with that, I am able to be myself, for there is that supportive brace (and glow) around, which removes faulty impetus', along with providing rest and recuperation following heavier bouts of effort. "The removal of novel and impassioned remedies is really nice, for not even the sharpest visiter feels like an intrusion." Besides that we have no friends. I have reached out to Justin and Colin, nor am I done fretting through message boards and local groups, but that just might be our end. Still, this is a mark of the moment, for time will go one, be it communal or active based, whereupon you may meet someone; nor will your life over time, be it upon a return to work or some involvment with a group of people your age, will see more oppertunity to make friends then. At least, as it still feels now in less intended places, that trying brings out most of the cheer I need: for I am at any rate a friend to ourselves: and with that being more welcomed and settled, we can consistently proceed.
            <br>&emsp;In terms of where we live, our present home is in Kamloops. Our parents mean to move, but this has no known date. Still, in Kamloops there is church, pleasant views, fair weather, and nice roads and localles to scooter around; also, going to yoga sessions, church or other acitivies via your scooter is really an adventure for the day. Though, this is not so unique to here, as Vancouver has similar if not more localles of this kind. Better said though, that what is good is avaialble in each, only Vancouver has more iterations.
            <br>&emsp;I must admitt that our state is quite poor, though our comfort and warmth from those around me have given me some oblige in being so. I won't fetter too much, but I can remark on our third edition of the book, which upon completion can be shared with Jess (and her friend Nam), maybe Bronte or Shaelin, and perhaps through facebook -so Grandma can see. Also, I am familiarizing ourselves with the road to publishing, which seems to come about through agent relationships. From what I can tell you can submitt a detailed letter, personal and refelctive of you, and then see if someone clicks. Again, it is just nice to try, and although we've more grounds in that former, so is there similar room down the path for essays. And at any rate, our shorts are coming on line nicely, with the writing portion being pretty much ready to go. I can't see much income from this, nor oppertunity in any immedaite sense; but the importance, or fufillment rather, is coming further into fruition, which is nice. Too, merely trying to offer our book and essays offers a similar cheer, as I am not so concerned with what I want from it, but happy and bold enough to try: which in itself, solidifies our freedom to barely need it, which in effect offers us more open and laudible room to recieve what we do need. "And where we are with that, so is there all; and where there is that, we can be."
        </div>
        <div id="withdrawn">
            When I was younger I was indeed quite cynical. The common attire of people's attitude and ambition fit with me nothing short of not, and I thus became reserved, or reproached rather. In this though I had very few friends, and a trajectory of this which was more often than not decreasing. Still, there was plenty of stature, calm and joy, both in my days -at work or not- over the weeks, and generally over the years that would come.
            <br>&emsp;But as I still find, there is this impetus to retreat, or at least settle into yourselves. There is to be fair merrit in doing so, and much of that strenght which I described came exclusively from this. I must confess though, that I have made a grave mistake. For you see, my solitary life was not one of aimless lethargy, or idle complaining, but a decision, or resolve rather, to live fully and with wholesame care. This never seemed fitting, or at least reflective of other people's interest or time. My error though, was in the belief that there was no room for me to be amongst them in such ways: and unfortunately, the product of that was a place and time both free and pleasnet, but with no one to share it with, or for me to care. "And as it were, by the recent memory which sparked this insight -of my mistake- is in that realization that we have become uneccesarily unknown."
            <br>&emsp;It appears that we have thrown out our ability to exist happily and as I please, within the world of laws and men. We have for so long found that such a realm could not hold me in all my dearest and sincere of ways: but this has been wrong. On top of that, our emtions have revealed the consequent strain of this; for indeed thorughout our solitude we have hoped for and wished for a friend, and been otherwise scorched with bouts of passionat lust: but our hidden discomfort paired with self importance, had me believing that these desires would be passively met, 'as if we were either destined to receive, or striking enough to draw others in'. We forgot, or were nieve at least, to think that they had their own lifes, without room for envy or broad comparions mind you, but still one which would not so casually make you their aim; nor would they be so struck in the first place, for you never offered more than occasional impressions, of a good complexion sure, but nothing of substance or promise, 'beyond the mere benefit of simply being with me'.
            <br>&emsp;Neverthless, I still carry the wounds of this unfuffilled emotions. In any case though, we are making amends, or a change at least; and, almost as soon as we've started, in practice mind you rather than mere intent, we can see the reason why this change had to be done, and the nature of who we are and what we are best to do in such a collected way.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, if we let go of what we want, then we might just get what you need. For the former is in more ways than not bound to those riled emotions; and even if their is something basic to what you seek, so is our ill placed isolation and the common imperfections of us all, a catalyst to inflamming those desires, whereby their sensitivity bends past the mere point of proclivity, but into inappropraite passion -and all its begruding fears of scandals and innuendo. "You become a immoral pirate of the naughtiest sorts." At any rate though, our needs will come when we stop seeking, which in our case at least remarks that admission of retreat, and the consequent resolve to put ourselves out their more; for we may have built in discomforts and 'two left feet' as it were, but so is this a mark of you as opposed to what is wortwhile. And having been to Shambhala and church -and much more to come- I feel an easy breeze of communal warmth and simple expectations. This allows me to be myself without fear, but with filled out edges, which in the past would buckle as our isolation forced us to ware ourselves out. Now, I have more room, or a stretch at least, to become acquainted, ordained and known, which offers a steadier platform to try new things of a professional or friendly sort, and otherwise rest and recupurate as our personal efforts go through their periodic close. And for clarities sake, this point is so by virtue of our remission from overworking -as our loneliness would have us feeling idle as opposed to rested when we did nothing- and otherwise restoring ourselves through lighter activites.
            <br>&emsp;What I see then, in closing, is that having somewhere to go gives me an according place to care for; which itself strenghtens our general ability to learn and see. "As if the lens by which we see the world and all its pleasantries, had a wider and solid base to peer from." From here, I am able to care for and feel cared for by those who were once wrapped up in my lusts and misery. Effectively, communication and commradery brings one together with another, but as a person yourselves, so is their a world to care for. Or in other words, what I seek, or at least what my fullest and soundest self feels cheer by, is an aside to friendship, station and fate, but of our purest kind of leisure, craft and care. The specifics are'nt important, but I merely see this additions to our lives as ones which broaden our gaze, in that we are more relaxed, happy and plump. But our vision and the according industry is the true mark and stature of our heart and hand. "And it is not what those emtions sought which I am now in need of, nor would the subject in question -if it were in fact mine- treat me to anything more than happiness, rightly that is. It is my walk and talk from that pleasant point that is the meaning, even though there is much to be content with and glad in your happy place." Still, the point overall is that in this remission from isolation, or reservation at least and its according acceptence of what we in fact need, I can see more clearly what it is that I wish to give: and the warmth and pleasure on offer and, in effeact, what I can provide, or care for at least, gives me everything I need: for as it were, the limits of our otherwise fortune and all its liberal ways, was that we had no one or any room for that matter to care, and as such we sought for people to be near me so that I had the permitt to retreat. "But now, with the corresponding benefits, I go out there, and find that station of comfort and care outside of our home, but in the community instead, where friends and love can be found, but enough intially to furnish our tastes and deeds as a man -which is why my goal is to try and show up."

        <div id="upright">
            I must say I feel quite well. On the front end the sun gleems a bit brighter, as do the pale hues of the night sky shine more clearly; nor, on the back end, is there as much depravity or grough over seeing such bounds, in that before they would rub up against our inner discontent. That is so, for now we are more integrated, structural and proposed. Not only has this given me room and ease to let my foot (when it is appropriate) of the hammmer, but real desire has more room to settle in, as we are not so tight gripped on our otherwise struggling self.
            <br>&emsp;This is great, and although I see the nature of those inner troubles, I realize that it is from time that we are without satiety, rather than our reasoning. You see, we live in a rational world, which is to say one of economics and seperation. In this, we have learned that there is room to participate and mingle, but so must we remain with ourselves; and happily too, for we are so fortuned to be in such times, and personally privilaged at that. The point, is that in these times where oppertunity can become your driving factor, so can we settle inwards, resting with the actual aim of wellness, and making use of the open road to both attend and materialize; nor, as we said, does this mean we have to be in solitude, for there is church, temple, programs and activities, which positively allow you to involve yourself and rehabilitate (your otherwise liberal loads). And as I said, desire comes about from this, as we are not so begruddged or afraid to admitt our post, and thus we can have aims, attempt things or try at least, and otherwise see what it is we actually seek, 'while before we were afraid to admitt, for we were so exposed of having nothing -and wanting only infurriated that point'.
            <br>&emsp;There is much clarity, and cementing this all around into a more bold yet even approach -and the according elements- is something that time will provide. But right now I can only rest, happily even despite our whithered state. That is one of the benefits of having itinerary, is that you have less pressure to push yourself, and otherwise feel fine with feeling the way you are. As I say, as we are dextrous and bipedal, so are we honest and rational; and these need no license to amend, but rather a firm grip on both their findings and investigative properties. As it were, the marks against yourself reveal themselves in the tiniest (sometimes) of ways, and being more attentive and alert to this will at least expose the symptom as so, by which your reflections can discern the cause: and disposition readily obliges.
            <br>&emsp;Over time then we seem to be on a steady road upwards. For we have always been fine, great even, and much has come to boot because of this. I can illustrate this fact though, that as those better times came about that it was due to us letting go of the world around, and then letting our true actions and intent rise. In this we created our website, naturalized our ways of living, wrote our book amidst a bound of accompanying things. And now, in this most gifted of times and merry ways, I realize that there is nothign which could make me happy, for I already have all, but rather I seek connection, purpose, meaning or activity, and only can this be procurred, anticpated or experienced through our actions, which we are without bounds to attempt. Only, and my point, is that in this fullest way that we've been through the period prior, we were still on record with thinking that such an integral self would grant us corresponding rewards. And as of now we are in the mind of letting that go, for we are no longer confused with the greens of that and of our real soul. In that, as they say, we have everything and are no longer in the buisness of wants, but instead surrendering to what we have and letting our actions reflect such allocations, 'whereby we seem to be recieving what we actually need'. Before we were so bent on getting something from being me, but these things are no longer of worth. Instead, we are full, we are complete, and as if an extension of those liberal portions of our self, we are merely ingratiaing that into our human self, whereby we let go of this desitined post of kings and tycoons, but rather a man, who is happy with himself and content to procceed, but then appropriates himself via industry, trade, friendship and community, with a natural gait. There are still things to define, and seeing more as we do in this peacefull state, warrants more consideration (and definement). How thankfull we should be though, that these items of interest, or at least subjects behind this farthest veil, are marks from our real self coming to terms with its dearest and foremost sought fruition. "I fear not to see all around, for I am in fact prime to proceed, as opposed to hanging on to ourselves and other means in order to grab them: we can merely be."
        </div>
        <div id="birthday">
            It is my birthday, and I am 28 years old. I can see far ahead the marks of what will result in our expression of becoming a man, and so to those fainter things which until recent, held little regard. We are with not but cheer, and only slowed by our childish infirmities. "Removing such begrudgeries has made me feel most pleasant; and, as other things of the sort have occured similarly, I can tell that there is good amidst me, as although these refurbishments bring with them an uprooting of the filth that was below, so do these thorns and debris brush past me, stinging only on their route out the door; and as per our honest reflection, I know (of those thonrs) I was ceding to the right symptoms, as the stings I began to notice were of those irriations and falliblities which were entering me, as opposed to the current ones and their leave."
            <br>&emsp;Such is the way for someone like this, who like Mr. Hume, means only to live as our mind and liberality choose to. For clarity sake, I will specificy that our present adjustments are such that our place in the world and our time with its inhabitants is gaining a more appropraite standing; but, and to my credit, this is only due to our release of poorly placed, or at least unneccessary reservations, which by my acocunt, were only there from our liberal aims being squeezed into the purpose of fortune and fame. As I have since noted, this hold that I had was understandable, as our literay and crafty character was built out of reproach and remission; but, as it were, we bore little friendship or equity in such positions, nor was there any lack of conflict and criticism, which over time made me helm ourselves with even more decency and constance, but conseuqently with more tightness and obsintnace. At the moment we have relinquiehs such control, for the hopes of those confined quarters no longer speak to me as worthwhile gains; for all the conflict of being me and struggle of doing so well has been surpassed, and we are admittedly free to be, fully. Again, the desires that pressured me from around still lingered, but as of late their hold has lessened as we subcummb to our actual interests innate to the hearts of man. "Forgo what you want, and you may get what you need."
            <br>&emsp;And since being me was all I ever wanted, and that achieving so is both secure and bountifull, we need no further regard for it -as if to prove or releive our confined efforts. This has removed the need for our overly arhacic and or scrutiable restrictions, and in effect has allowed me to be more curious about people and work around, or otherwise move and angle ourselves in a more comfortable and progressing way. I will confess though that such openess to the warmth of solidarity and itinerary shows how little we held prior; and as I had ambitions regarding our sheltered self, so did I have hopes and fancies for women, money and infamy, which now upon being more open, ware at me as they leave. "those dang thorny emotions." Again though, these are fallibiities which are no longer being pressed inwards and inflammed, but are more free to expose themselves and dissipate. Doing so has left me feeling both engaged and in tune with gentle invovlemtns to come, which in combination releives that all to common perfection that I once saw as neccessary; in effect, we are able to restore ourselves, and not ware ourselves thin to begin with; which itself allows for better work when such efforts are fitting, and otherwise for us to enjoy our leisure and craft when those would in fact be prefferred. "Whereas before, being unengaged with some grand or fortuitous task had me feeling idle and defeated: now I can more gently proceed." Worth noting too, is our ease and merry advancements into working fields, or those of social worth. BEcause we aren't afraid, we are both free and measurably eager in becoming acquainted with the processes and path towards publishing, trade-work, and (in that social aspect) online dating. Practically, we learn the tools and properties required, and then construct our actuall view and intent, as if we were deliberating the actual mateiral or content fitting for the prompts in question. "What is our book actually, and what of it do we want to share and say (to the publisher)? What are you actually looking for in a women, who are you to be sought and other things of the sort." Doing this fosters a certain complexion of fair desires, which itself has me anticiapting what is actually sought, while also removing fragmented wishes and fancie'd criticism -whereby you hate yourself for not being what some novel person requires. These sprouts of possibility are our own, and furnish us with a life which is nice in front, and also confiding in that we are the ones advancing it -or trying at least, which, in short, removes any fleeing feelings or regret over having your head pointed to the bottom.

        <div id="doldrums">
            I can't quite comment on whether being connected with someone would render any dullness outside of this as permimssiable. An initial thought is that as little as you are, from the low pressure around lets say, so would you be comparable in your connection. As it were, a relationship is such that you give something and receive something, and having little of the former does not suggest much in terms of the latter.
            <br>&emsp;Still, my recent insights tell me that with respect to connection, all our troubles and worries surround this; and I only bring up the possible shortcomings of having so (with nothing else) if only to question whether nothing else would be needed is such connection were there. To me, this fairs some truth, for withotu an average connection you must be so much more, or fair the worse of things. 
            <br>&emsp;My point, is that no matter how good you are and all things around, that lacking a connection will procurr some frailty, or restlestness at the thought of being somewhere (contendedly) or not going somewhere where such connection could be found. I can say as of late though, that it is not so much the connection which is an issue but the lack of possibility, or at least a course which is somewhat social and involved, despite lacking a clear connection: you at least look forward to it, nor are you dragged so much by false and far of hopes or positiones, 'whereby your empty heart sees anything other than your isolated place as one of oppertunity'. It is by this that emotions get built and oppertunities that would otherwise reflect your integrated place, get developed as ones which reflect the aims of one without integration. So in that our past solitude is rearing up its adjacent longings. Though, we in that stage of life procurred ourself as to overcome this, but in effect flattered ourselves to much and elsehwere fell to the fancies and illusions of reservation and idle haste. As we have become more ingrained into a recreational and communal sort, we are seeing more oppertunity ahead, all whilst feeling better and clearer in our solid selves, along with sinking into confidences and approaches that reflect such a self moving forward (or into) realms and regions which were once forbidden -as we were either to afraid or quick to condemn such actions. 
            <br>&emsp;The future then is quite hopefull and exciting, but of a natural and sprouting sort. We do have those old emotions and expectations coming up, which in themselves wrangle our new found confidences, as they appear as means to procurr such desires. But as those interests fade and new ones, or possible ones at least come in, so will our otherwise advances settle into their own practical lanes, whereby we can both boldly and unaversibly proceed. To those I would like to mention
            <br>&emsp;First, and in general, is our fragments, which to begin held Batttlefield 5 as its starting roster, and has since then transitioned into Battlefield 1. In its case there is a retread back into the basics of publishing, but so are our hopes mild, nor are our future intentions of bringing writing into the platform haltered by any amount (or not) of success regarding these prior bf clips. As it were, those battelfield clips have shown that there is a brisk interest, which itself shows no signs of reaching a monetary sort, nor is oppertuinty much closer -especially considering the actual merrit of achieving so is through writing- so I can say, for the moment and the period to come, that whether I care or not is the real question; and so far, as our channel has come, I feel nearly full in our meaning of the clips, which the fragments themselves will show. In that, for a briefer word, I am committed and ready to make it because that is what I want to do: and the lack of money in the years ahead nor oppertunity much sooner, is no hurdle for the otherwise couple hundred views each video gets. By this count, an increase in that reception only makes me care more, and finding oppertunitites or income only come from the constancy that is motivated through that. So in that sense, we are on track, but happy where we stand. And to be exact, the actual elements of those coming fragments are themselves nearly set, and only in need of a refinement in the assembly: but each part is itself done.
            <br>&emsp;Besides that we are working to create the third version of our book. This one is meant to be somewhat final, as I intend to submitt it to publishers. That in its own right has become a relieving success, as simply familiarizing ourselves with the requirments and letting our response naturally cultivate, makes the path towards that a pleasing one. Still, the book has added a new section, while removing unneccessary parts to the prior ones. As well, we've arranged the pieces much better, leaving one's to do with philsophy and what not as the first part (of rounding out lets say) then put the personal, considerate pieces in the latter half. "think ostentation for New Light and For Goondess in rounding out." There are many to be fair which are on the chopping block, and many (if not more) require a second look for the purpose of tightening. My aim is to finish by the end of January and at  least have  a version for myself, and althoug theres no short amount of time (and thus pressure) to finish by that date, when we do we can send it to our family and friends, which is nice. If we are accepted for publishing then we will do a closer pass on every entry, as I am sure theres a spelling mistake, or room for improvement at any rate for each of them. But for now, we can create our own piece, then take the gems and offer those as samples for agents or publishers. On top of this though is pure essay submission, which seems rather direct and prolific in its possibility. I am less tuned in to what that requires, but I am sure when we write our querry letters we can approach the piece-submissions similarly.
            <br>&emsp;On our own private end, I mean to write our autobiogrpahy. At least, in a comparable way to our trackings of cosmology and geology, so do we need some firmness in our childhood and youth, and adolescence as it would seem. There is much reflection from this, alongside further questions which will serve the refinement that our subsequent book needs. To mention that, A Mason's Tale is a reflection of our live and time and a deliberation as to how it can better change. This is a tuning period of our time, with not much but inquiries coming from this. What I seek is a complete step, which is to say anwsers and conclusions from that calibrated self. In that domain sits the corpral nature of violence, war and gratuity, the limits of physical vocabulalray, the weakness of intervention (and its according assumptions), and the otherwise free and liberal stream of nature and her gifts- whereby leisure, industry, care and rest are assessed. I mean to mention this in the forward of our book, along with the 'attempt' like nature of each piece and how the heart of it is to be (if so) commended, and that poor writing may be a consequence of this pure inquiry/attempt. 
            <br>&emsp;In any case, our own formative writings are of these kinds, where we begin to address what it is we actually think and can conclude: and chartering ourselves will secure the loosers prefaces to our mind. On a casual scale, ie. the wonder of clouds, we have come through cosmology, geology and paleontology, ancients, middle ages and somewhat into the times of industry, whereby there are modern elemtns which are somewhat desirable, though the contents of the world are actually what strike me now, as in the bios of the greats, the fields of study -namely the church- and that of trade and technolgoy -those virtues of engineering and agriculture, along with the workings of a camera. Perhaps sums will follow.
            <br>&emsp;I can tell that our plan is not hedged on us being alone, and then counting on the natural outgrowth of the corresponding fruits. Instead, we are sweeteneed enough, and happy to boldy yet plainly proceed, whereby that outgrowth is more firmly advanced and made. Admittedly, we do have our own privations -ie. the fragmments- but these are themselves a personal priority, as I really do care; and considering their sole demand of constancy and according promsie from doing so, I can still say with honesty that such a course (and efforts) reflects those private outgrowths, but of a bolder kind. Whereas before we thought taht either A) we would simply outgrow from simply being me, or B) that by making a website or something basic like that, that some wiff of this would cross someone by and spark their interest: and oh how great we are that they'd then see, and the worlds interest was in store. I know little of what we could recieve, but I am safe in saying theres not much I could wish for; at least when it comes to the fortunes of free living and travel that these are but further garnishes to our liberal self, and that connection is not only present in the most illfortuned of ways, but garnered no more from those which are in fact fortuned. "For all it takes is openesss and communication, which no scenario procurres or bolsters. Its a means to hiding and remaining in control if you feel otherwise." I will say in the Fragment's case, that we have set up a fair routine for wide creation, and that for the most part the work in question is both of a desirable and fruitfull sort, at least for me (as we are invovled and received enough to care). In that, the point in which constancy will need a refill is far away enough that I am fretting not whether we will do it at all, and if so how we will do it that much; for in a month I am sure we could at least do a 100, which gives me much time to write and publish till then, and otherwise in between. Mom and Dad are planning on moving, as are we happy to then be in the city, where there are more churches, drop in activites and events, along with other things of an involved sort. Dating is expensive, but the value is there once were settled; and all this in combination with our scooter (and resourcefull use of transit) makes the world wider and purer than ever before. In that, I am excited, comforted, and secure enough to try advanced things. Whihc, to be clear, offer little more than you could get alone, in terms of the dearest things at least; but still, as money would offer no more, so would you want some for the goods it brings, which such advances can be targeted for, or aimed at rather. "Don't confuse it is what I mean, as you are indeed on track, or working towards more worldy and exciting things, but so is this ununque when it comes to finding love, creativity or friendship. And, in fact, those things being addressed are what will bring you down that professional line, so that there is more food on the plate amdist your love otherwise. Just don't forget where each came from, and how you can be right now."
        </div>
        <div id="endofanera">
            I was so brazen in our hopes, but perhaps rightfully so. We are indeed amongst the class of those who would be rightly considered remarkable. "And although my estimate may be off, I can at least humble myself in saying that, amidst that class, we are of the lowest." I am effectively permitting my decree of caliber by reserving its nature, 'as if I were simply saying that I was amongst the best, only behind them'; in this though there is much flattery, 'for oh how little am I comapred to those greatest, in being so slightly behind'. 
            <br>&emsp;I do try at any rate, and, be it well or fully placed, I still hold myself accountable. In all these sentiments there is a bit of innacruacy, and deceipt at that. But I have gone through the shcool of knocks, at least there have been several moments where our honest self was shown to be poor. Addressing that and making amends is whats brought me to where I am. "whereby I stand taller, but from farther back, in the sense that my heart and soul have been mended and set, as to provide a deeper platform to rise from."
            <br>&emsp;So although it seems like the end of an era, and stage at that, I still see more of the same ahead. Only, as we have experienced before, that the coming steps will be stronger than those prior, particularly when it comes to those macro adjustments that our weakness' held us to do. People are returning to our life, as are we to people. Our importance, despite receding, held us in terms of quality and approval, yet we were idle in our activity, or hasty otherwise in bringing it to life; in that, we were both afraid or unconcerned with being more forward, heeding what we were drawn to try at least. Now we are making a firm advance; not with any rush in mind or fear from our past mistakes, but one which is merely forward and unhindered by procrastination or discomfort. "As it were, we've surrendered ourselves to what we need, and in that we are unafraid (nor heavily staked)" to boldy be, and proceed. This came about in our fragments, but so is that resting (perhaps the easiest) on the simple act of doing what I seek, and at any rate relishing (and continuing from such return) the meager sufficiency required. "Or the short means to satisfaction at that, which our writing, essays, dating, community and what not (ie. future jobs and efforts) are sprouting to comply. Which gives much tender yet firm clarity and footing in our advance ahead." Such a smooth and ready course is most pleasing.
        </div>
        <div id="aboutourdays">
            As we have come about our days, much has been fostered, quite little which has been lost, and admittedly a great deal which has been passed over unneccessarily. In effect were in a predicament, though a fair amount of reflection and habit will surely mend it out.
            <br>&emsp;'What can we learn about the way things are', is what I find myself saying. We knew that our worldy ambitions were based on what we thought was possible, and more prominently weighted by our relation between where other people were and where I thus sought to be. I also know that from this goals, we were so reserved in our daily action, as the method by which we'd approach was one that was both unlimited in terms of how much we could put in, and accordingly in need of a relative amount of skill and strenght from us personally. Now, as regards friends, purpose and pleasure, I will say more later. As for our practical living and ease of movement, I can say the purest thing which is the calming and securing place of regular iternaries. Here, you are amongst people, and even the mere conversation regarding your name and intent is soothing; both, in that it gives your place more clarity and peace, along with evening out the road to come, as there is somewhere to return to; which itself, primarily, softens the reigns a little, as you have less need to push forth out of idle fears seeing as some committment is coming. On top of that, these activities are quite light in comaprions, and that social aspect adds a warming flare, that in combination allows our more rigorous creative time to settle and incorporate. This has been nice and dandy, especially considering the brief time its been done.
            <br>&emsp;Our core mistake rises though, as in being so initial in our outward strides, so have the more significant aspects of this not taken hold. In regards to friendship and attraction, the road has been not much more than level. In fact, as we left highschool the path seized, and less we were in college or working, the exposure to other people was sparse. And at that, our communicatio was quite poor, as our early cynicism and later constance held me from either offering my interest or time to other people, and being pro-active and outgoing at any rate -which is more in line with what were doing right now. And that being said, our current situation is not one that affords much space to be more open and forward, but merely try in our attempts to put ourselves out there. Also in these regards is our further sight on writing and our recent forray into the content world. These at least are offering more forward steps towards the broader side of the world, and in effect is quite uplifting, as we have no reservations to try, and are otherwise leaning inwards enough to proceed. "Such inhesitance offers a the according result, of feeling on track; nor is our boldness and content in doing so an unimportant point, for we fear not to lose or have much haste to gain, but a mere step towards the whole of things; and in that we bring our true self."
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, we are not in much company, at least enough for others to commonly pass us by. We are electing to go out there, which itself takes off the edge along with breathing in some consistency, but for the most part these involvements are only of that sort, and as such offer but faint chances to make a friend. At the very least, there has not been someone who seems to draw my sight, for the majority of folk in question are much older. I do mean to go to yoga, but still, even if there were a bevy of attractive women, converse would still be hard. Time does offer much to those who keep to her sides; which allows both more to be gained from the simplest of things, and otherwise offers the chance for things to change and grow. Trying then rewards us with such, for the possibility is at least there; though the further bounds of deeper connection feel faint.
            <br>&emsp;Neverthless, I do see much hope on this horizon; for I cannot pretend like we aren't free anb satisfied in being more full and founded with ourselves. "The years have always lacked such ease." And at any rate, the more we try in those common affairs, so are we more liable to consider other things, which at the very least broadens the pool of possibility. Nor are there a lack of things which offer more direct attempts, such as online dating or training. These have their own molds to fit, but as a screw we are becoming more sizeable and malleabe where we seek to take hold.
        </div>
        <div id="ourguard">
            So I can say that we are refined in our desires, however unmet. As with most things of this sort, it is not so much the lacking but our guard and reservation from seeking, which has me feeling closed off. At any rate, the actual shortcomings of being without, can be procurred on both the ends of fortitude, along with the appreciation and use of whats already here. This is all fine and pleasing, for we are not absent from much, merely moving as ourselves, with our family, active and communally invovled... but wheretoo then? As we have so much, and are otherwise on route, and at least fortified against whats not, there is no burning flame behind us, pushing is out of what would otherwise by an ioslated discontent, whereby we'd stake our forward efforts on acquiring us the means of attraction and renound: if only to connect. Without this here, there is much room and reason to reassess and furnish your aims. For I do not wish to be idle, or reckless despite our supportive warmth. As it were, we still lack much of what makes the world beyond us exciting; and that isn't so much about what we cannot see, or where we cannot go, but who we are with and in what fashion. Although there is possibility and our proceeding steps seems more sound and well placed, so are at most involved in common activities and the according people. Theres few our age, nor is there much constance of conversation and relations for something past the point of peerdom to be gained. This is fine indeed and in effect removes the edge and gratuity of being myself, but so are we only that. Perhaps in a way, we only ever will be, even if that means we are in the bounds of another, or off on some adventure. We will still be me; and in efffect, those meaningfull or intimate efforts seem both fair and desired on their prescence and place amongst that person which is I. In that sense, we are happy to proceed, for in our lack we are still with ourselves, honestly, and of those things which draw us, despite their abscnece, we are sincere in our hopes of them.
            <br>&emsp;I think, in short, that we are best to address the things you actually wish to do, and furnish them with an integrity to the things themselves. In that, we need no fear or contrivance about what we will get, or will lack. We know that of those things which bring love and warmth to our life is only acquired through communication, and otherwise amends. The fruits of fortune and the trades are but a scenario in which we can be; yet, at least as I can reflect, the shortcomings and accompanying reservations for that are in the known lackings of such love and warmth, despite our freedom for liberty and fecundity. Those are fine, and having such favor as to be able to do that, makes we feel swell. But not even the kingdom of England would ever gain much peace in my heart, less I had a friend, or at least was one to myself; which, in effect, since we are naturally and normally drawn to the comforts and company of men, means that if we are not held back from approaching so, or being near and around at least, then we will not be happy. That is the lesson, and the current effects are such that our prior ways did not proucurr what our current actions are aimed at. But we are reassessing now; and in seeing that our ways are most importantly unreserved, then we can whitehr off this need to expect, yet through contrivance succeed. Lets just be, curiously and for the sake of invovlement, all while letting who you really are come and shine to be. I know not where, but I can confidently say that I am not afraid to succeed. We just want to be ourself, for in that there is not much limit other than me: which over time, fell to the reserved nature that occurred due to our dishonesty. In that, we were not or nor have we been sad or defeated because we lacked fame and friends, but because we retreated from desiring so, or at least told ourselves against. These things are not neccessary, but in our reproach from what was otherwise not contemptable, we both furled ourselves down some ill-sighted road, and held our breath at what was desirable. In other words, it was not our lack but our reservation; for in being more open the world feels less misguided or seperate, but rather integrated, yet of members who are not their for me, nor I them. My heart being open means that I can freely go my way; which by my brain and bones fetters not over these abscences, but is quite happy to feel like the possibility could exist; or at any rate, if someone were to pass by, we'd be open. Which is the point: not that one had or will, but that if it did we were not closed off.
            <br>&emsp;So, for instance, I want to describe nothing, argue against intervention, confirm the nature of dark energy, acquire the time and place of the greats, dance through yoga to Oceania, discuss the gifts of Joker, Moria, Golden Gate, Rex Paddock, the Veil of tears -towards the door, glance from the side. The integrity of depth, "Mark that man (who is a women), or, hey guys (to a group of girls)," the purpose of government -and my obediance. In other words, warrant my interests because I tried, and am at liberty to be drawn, but not so because we are free, but because I stand truly enough that attempt, as not to fear that our means will not further for some other end, nor the confusion that their needed for this, but the honest reproach, to seek such things and embrace their sincere place as your interest, which the approach draws out meaing's, task's, reason's and purpose's warrant -as being so.

        <div id="plainbeat">
            I'm just tired, plain beat. Not for long admittedly, but right now our strides are feeling heavy. What I am noticing, is that in this state the world feels small; for there is nothing so defined, and fairly so, that extends past ourselves, or whats common at any rate. Thus we feel closed in. 
            <br>&emsp;In effect, our deed is to rest; for it is alright that not much is ahead, for like air that lifts up a tent, so is our stream absent, whereby that canopy of life seems small. This is ok, we must merely rest. Doing so though is boring, and our choices offer no real excitement. As it were, in those times of old, we procurred little of this for it seemed like the domain of our selection included the use of substance (and poor ones at that). We could simply use these things ourselves, and be quite content. Though the lesson as of late is that such domain of outerward interests is not so selective, to gluttony that is, but holds activities and events which are more warming and communal. Still, these never crossed my mind, for my aim was not so much of rehabilitation, but something equally exciting as our sprung up state would otherwise enjoy: I did not see the value of restoration or rest. In those more common things (and fresher too), their activity was of a lighter sort, so you would be moving but with less concentration; and otherwise, the structure that they'd bring would allow us to easily to sit and relax, as something was seen coming. "As it occurred though, our lack of itinerary had me moving ahead, for doing nothing with little that was further (ahead) defined, made me feel isolated and terrible."
            <br>&emsp;It would seem, and I am going back to the junkfood era of our childhood and the scandalous nature of our youth, whereby the course of our life has been more or less determined by whether we were bored. For, good things come to those who prepar, and are otherwise consistent; but repitation requires breaks, or at least genuine lows of the interval; and when that was so, we were not able to rest, recuperate than go at it again. Our principle held us over time, but not to a growing state, as everytime we built up and rest was needed, we indulged and levelled out where we were before. Learning from this has made our subsequent attempts greater, and generally over the recent years our constancy has been more ingrained, but so are we moving, yearning to leave our rest, and still not making much progress. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, our frivolous desires bear on our resting state with a the pressures of inferiority and discontent. Even if we are fine to be still, such feelings prick at me to move hastly. "At least that is our response to these feelings, and their cause coming from our stillness." Now, passing this as a model, whereby we'd address what rest is for, in our aims at least, I can otherwise say that when you are in fact moving, the world's canopy elevates, and farther things can be seen. In that, with a clear mind, you can see various things to do; which contrasts the restless nearsightedness that can otherwise occur. That is, when wish to move but have little to give, and the world is small, you feel poor at the lack of things to be seen. Moving properly brings this to life; and as our consitency has allowed for our steps to produce more grounds, or familiarity at least, to those farther things, so does their memory stay. And, at any rate, as we grow under these fairer developments, we can see more; as if, upon the return to our readied state, we have a full tank of sight and optimism, whereby the elements which we saw before are given more interest and life, as to at least further our excitement and solidity to the road ahead. In a way then, it is our restless nature which has us burning out the nearby edges, and keeping our time ill prepped for those wholesome strides, and is otherwise grinding at best towards that secondary layer. "But not to the world around."

        <div id="walksofmen">
            Happily, we are reading David Hume, who has much forward yet plain speech, similar to mine and Plutarchs; though the subjects he covers are, lets say, more modern; and even his assay into human affairs, holds similarly contemporary points of view (when compared to Plutarch). For instance, he distinguihses the passions from taste, saying that the former holds more elation at both the good and bad extremes, while the latter holds more stock in great people, study and the arts: and his suggestion, more or less, and which I am in agreement of, that being more moderate in those former passions will provide a pleasing and amiable living in the common elements of our time, while those liberal tastes can be otherwise selected, which he suggests we do so for the sweets of that, rather than being overly passionate. He speaks about government a great deal, which admittedly falls over me as I am less clear on the terms; though, in being so plain and stately, I see a brief road to connect our own ideas, and develop them at any rate, which seems to let off the edge within our civil affairs -as we have held little knowledge here to date. One instance of merrit I saw, was his regards for the point of governments; and that in discussing this, the property of obediance came up; here he makes the simple remark that authority and liberty must convene and co-operate, with those giving up the  latter doing so through obediance, while those holding the servicable position of the former, must listen and amend, as their post is one guided by the protectice and servicable nature of the law. In my mind, our governments, of Canada that is but generally those modern, are not ones which we have any need to overthrow or worry about; theres but a mere slant towards various points of view in parliment: yet the system remains. The particular offices which bear such slant, and those who act as speakers and educators are fair in their offerings, but less I do this well, then my place already is to heed what the government says, if only to receive the liberty which its authority provides. Unless that authority reigns itself in, and unneccessarily so, then I will obey: otherwise, I will then be concerned and take action.
            <br>&emsp;Lastly, on the initial front, is the Gallic war. This was a over thought from some time back, and only in the recent holiday months did I see the chance to grab it. In fact, amongst the books I purcahsed, it was the last. I am pleased then to share the mighty time I've had reading it. Foremost is the clear way that its presented, and the fair nature in which its material reflects. So much of my life I have been toiling against this impression (and normality) of the brutality, rape, tortue and cruelty, that reading the plain words of Caeser have given me ample regard and cheer. The simple reason, is that within an event -such as thee Gallic war- there are a bevy of steps and alltercations, each with their own beginnings, exchanges and ends. One such example is the punishment issued by Caeser to one of the tribes who had rashly attacked them following a peace-treaty; his account is that the senators were executed, and the people sold into slavery. How nice is that, that such a sentence is, in all its severity, holds not much darkness. There is a remark about a Germanic king who had, as stated, tortued children given over (as hostages) from a surrendered tribe; but even then, I suspect they were branded, as the act was supposedly done so as a mitigating threat. At any rate, I can summize the general appeal of this by drawing the integrity of depth, whereby I reserve myself from being opionated of situations in which I am ignornat, yet, I hold the accounts of what should be know with such integrity of depth that I am willing to be so reticent across the world as a whole. Seeing the ordinary interactions of the Romans and the Gauls, and how even the term 'Gaul' holds no definitive weight, gives me the impression that in China, India, Russia, all of Europe, the modern states and countries, that we are so likely to be wrong in our views due to the fact that we are almost surely ignorant of the many parties and their interactions, that being reticent seems appropriate. At least, in reading about the Gallic war, I feel like I have an account which respectfully defines the world, whereby I see how little else anything is probally known, for no thing -across the walk of our lives, but in which we have so many opinions of- obviously holds any similar sort of reference, by which our opinions are made. Recently, I had a similar experience reading Rousseau's memoir, whereby the comparable world of industrial France came to light, and all those murky (and sometimes cruel) images of past times was shed. This is quite comparable to the subject of war, which, in short, held nothing but our imagination filling in small holes, which themselves could not find much else to think of than the excruiting detail of killing a man with a sword; yet we are so wrong to worry about or consider so, for we have entirely no sense or mind for where such action occurs. And, as I stand, both are those details migthily overlooked, and due to a lack of context or placement. That is its own discussion; but I can say, that being empty headed, but letting stories, fables, accounts and graphic imagery fill it, is more akin to drops of dye inpurifying an other wase clear vase of water, rather than an earthy mold which serves as a solid and encompassing mold for particulars to be sketched in. "As it were, lacking the latter while having the former, is much better than being inundated with the latter, but of a hollow mold."

        <div id="tochurchandback">
            For the present then, I can only say that it invovles, well, much invovlement. So far, we've been to the United Churhc, which was pleasant, the Buddhist Church, which was good and fair, twice the Shambala, which, albeit challenging, held much profit and warmth (in its company), and all of this with two coffee chats in between -whereby we learned, and evened out our view of online work (and its means), and travel, and its niceties, but frequency too. That is our day, and, soon, we will be doing Yoga sessions (Hatha, intermediate), and some sort of spiritual group gathering. Thats quite a bit I'd say! Although there is more on these horizons, I will mention I present creative pursuits -as to be more present. One, is that the shorts are prepped and readying along. Besides the titles, and filling out the rest of April, we are scheduled till the start of May, whereby we will take the assembly we've created, produce, and employ Epictetus's writings. This path is one which will take time to come to fruition; but the work is quite significant to me, particualry in how it represents, and is otherwise quite fulfilling and clarifying from the work we do. On top of that, we are bringing our sights onto publishing, whereby we send out letters, and otherwise scan and find both common and modern outlets to inquire of. In effect, our aim is tigthen our book, going over each piece and giving them a firm pass, then arranging them to be more readable and flowing. The intent, or at least broader aim, holds the book in these forward regards; but as our time loosens from such editing, and our energy can transfer to submission, we can also consider the inidivudal essays themseles; which seem to offer more chances of selection, and more particular outlets to do so. 
            <br>&emsp;Now, regarding our studies, which admittedly have less reason then our life can attest, is still important to me. In short, we mean to go over things which feel alarmingly stricken by me; be it the clouds, the general idea of governance, the churhc, or the mere workings of a camera (and light for that matter). I would remark on what we need, though our course is not so clear. Foremost, is that we are a word, tired, and such reflects our adult life, and all its pride and shortcomings. Better yet, our admission to this does not retract the effects which our mistakes afforded. And so, despite our mind being somewhat on track, and our steps moving with a fairer pace, whereto we do not know, for we are still weary from those harsher strides prior, and of those literally of late. In that, I will refer to what is passing ahead, and leave a firm remark as to our ends for later. Simply, I have been vetting various activites; the aim, admittedly, is to make a friend or find a partner, but time is required for that, nor are the bulk of such activities privy to that. "In their like of people my age, or like me at any rate, and the required time to be acqaintanced at that." Still, we are personally benefited from this tasks, as their light activty and regularity gives us both something restorative to do, and otherwise shoulders our proper ability to let off our own reigns, and relax. The Church, Yoga, the particular zoom call we've done and meditation session at that, offer this in nice amounts. But I see more of these things we can try. For instance, joinging an elective program, of say cooking or photography, can allow for some skills, enjoyable activity, relative peers and the according bonds made through regular excitment. These may be timely, too expensive, short, and otherwise unavailable; but with some research, I am sure we can find something at local colleges, city centers, or anything at that. On that note, Yoga is something quite pleasant, integral and usefull; so much so that the price of it seems of value, particulallry if your attneding to your life as opposed to your future position. In that, we can research different offerings, and find the one suited for me. We may even find something similar to the program were in; which admittedly is once per week, but of a fair price. Otherwise, the YMCA, cheap drop ins at studios, and otherwise well-evalualted prices, can afford good selection. Regarding churhc and temple, these are more common in the metro area, but present everywhere to some extent. More than that, on one end, is strict meditation or spiritual gatherings, which offer a yougner audience (I'd say), and more approachable grounds for both enjoyment and converse; on the other end, sits different kinds of group, akin to church, but of a secular and or humanist sort. This too requires research, but through meetups or organizatoins, we may find somewhere to go. That, in a word, is the crux of our interest, which refers nicely to what I mentioned above, wherein we tned to our live, not our future position. In that, we can move without fear, for we are ourselves and unmitigatinlg so; as such, we need no reservation for some other end, nor the discomfort of not getting what we seek: we need only show up. Be it to writers events, submission contests or offers, mixers and other public things of the sort, we can try, explore, get invovled. Money may limit us out of regular attendance to things -such as the symphany- or our interests may not align; but research, openess and acquiesing, provides, so try.
            <br>&emsp;To close, I'll note some things which we mean to incorporate. An old one, but of interest via its utility, is the increase of our voice, both in its projection and annunciation. "So Soliluquiy is easier to say, proudly." Air purifiers, and voice lamps, seem to improve our room; and in terms of value, their favor may be less so in the warmer and lighter months, yet we still have three months nearly of cold; so theres some starting worth at that. Perhaps this is in line with our studies, but moreso of a task, is our history; this is in need of accounts for our homes, schooling, people, jobs, fitness and mind. Details, mistakes, vision and thoughts ahead, can be remarked on: but this reference needs the floor itself. Which, as were talking about facts, can be just done, or noted at least, and drawn out through prose. Our studies are moreso for light, devices, government, the greats, and the civil measures of the world, along with the Big Bang, spectroscapy, the accerlation evidence and the flat universer. "As it a concrete starter, for doubting at least -as we know precisely where I knowledge goes."

        <div id="crownsandmen">
            So I am not sure what a demoacry is, in the purest sense; but I do know that, by public voting, that is democratic. In strict contrast is an absolute government, usually monarchal. Here, the rule is led by a supreme leader, along with his delegates; and, generally, this reign is passed on through family lines; and otherwise, power is gained by favor and prestige. A populous government on the other hand is one of a parlimentary sort, in that the rule is done by laws, enacted by choosen representatives to bring out those laws. There is a minister, or even a king, but if the system holds everyone in bound, then it is not wealth, prestige, blood or avarice that determines much, as the laws and input of others hold one back from producing so.
            <br>&emsp;In that, the questiono of liberty arrive, in that one has more rights and freedoms if that is so, while the authorative lens withdraws that. Clearly, there is a balance, evidently at least. For government is an agreement, for those who revolt and throw it down may in fact install a state of anarchy. At any rate, the development and dispersal of public goods will not be, well, governed. This is worth understanding as a pure alternative, but as it were, most upheavels usually end with a new sect of leadership being installed. It seems since the dawn of time, when efforts and needs were to be regarded and managed, that rule was required. And considering the domain of justice, conqeust, policing, commerce, the pulpit and other base services is so wide and usefull for civilized state of the world, so ought an according form, of fidelity, mark the force which governs it.
            <br>&emsp;In that, we may suspend our wishes to have full liberty, and that of commodity too; for the latter, as said, only comes through management. And, as a group of people all running by their own whims amounts to very little in a military sense, so do those, well arranged and ordered amount to more. For at least in this case an aim can be ardently pursued. This may be wrong then in that what we seek is not in need of such governance; but considering that those needs are in fact so, let us at least subject ourselves to any requirments for this if that is so. We can, for instance, be thankfull for our own personal strenght, along with our wit, but in terms of electricity, waste disposal, roads and the general laws (shouldered by enforcement) which allow us to practice religion, and walk the streets without fear of unbriddled crime, these are not so willfully acquired, but in a word, given. 
            <br>&emsp;As fair as this point is, we can rest a little on this authorative notion, that it is merrited so much as it provides what we seek, and does so in the ways which such desires are in need of. In regards to liberty though, we generally have all of it. There is, to be fair, a slew of things we cannot do, but here the mightiest point stands. Simply, if you wish to perform an act of thievy, battery, purgery or fraud, then a unit will dispatched from a goverened institution, and less you resist, you'll simply be arressted. As evidence from you being there and any other element which can be gathered, will be submitted to a body of judges, who, using not but the facts at hand, will determine what occured, then weigh that against the consequences that such acts are deemed within the law. The concenr of capital punishment arises as an instance where that sentence is up for question, but as a course of concluding lacivious affairs, so is that unviersal. What If I asked you though, 'would you walk over there for me, pick up my papers, then return them?' To which I may reply, 'sorry, but I cannot'. Consider, whether the former has any leverage against the latter, in that they could claim they were being infringed upon by the law. If the latter attacked the other person, then of course that would be the case. But, in this regard, if it is just a plea to do something, there is not common rule that says you must oblige. And I ask you, what rules there are that govern you to do anything? Failing to hold the door, saying thanks, being welcoming and polite in your gestures does, more or less, determine whether you'll make any friends, and may in effect lower your advantages towards benefit; but is any law saying that such must be obliged? 
            <br>&emsp;The authority of the law then seems most pressing, and relevant, when we consider what limits are placed on us in what we want to do. Better yet, seeing is there is not much which we (in a way) must do in order to get what we need, then the question of liberty is given. For we cannot pursue commerce, labor or trade withut paying taxes. Nor can we be a miserable prick and expect any pleasure, rewards or employment. Nor, if we had all the coin in the world, could we own anything without municipal submission. At this point though, we are in need of a firmer sight of the need for government to begin with. We may, at any rate, wish to go back to a time where all we needed was done so through our willfull gathering, where no authority was needed. But so much as anything is, and considering the complexity where thats arrived, so is an accordingly secure government required. I am not, for the moment, suggesting what it is we exactly need; but I am for the moment presuming the need for courts, commerce, police to name a few. And that given those, we only need be concerned with the sufficient managent of that. Be it monarachal, communistic or democratic, that is for men, essayists, schemere and pundants to decide. But, of their hopes, or fairs ends at least, it is the provision and maintence of goods and services that society needs; or in other words, the worth of authority, and how such a reign should be with respect to the worth its governance is based on. 
            <br>&emsp;For I do not know why taxes are required; nor do I have much insight as to whether policing is effective. But the question, as all problems bring this, is about our liberty. Again, it is a given that certain things which we seek, and are fine to accept as favorable, requires some authority. But why does property operate the way it does within such governance; why are their common laws in general, as in the ability to drive while intoxicated, or the control of substance use or commerce. I do not know. And, to reiterate, despite being asked little by the law, and considering there is not much dispute that crime and theft cannot be done withotu punishment, we still have the a canopy of civil legislature above us. In that sense, there are borders which we cannot freely cross, nor can we access certain services without basic obligement; nor can our children be ours with pure soverignty. These come to mind, but the point is that, considering our wants and need that regard our liberty, so are there limits on that. We may alter our previous point by saying that public services and preferences are in fact besides our liberty, and as such merrit some submission to authority -as they govern the provision of it. But all other things which refer to things we are otherwise able to do, understandibly at least, have their own questionable limits, or authority; whereby the way we spend our coin, hold a family, drive a car, are not liberties which we purely have. Again, the functioning of the world beyond the provision of grain is something we have to consider; for in that, the need for government is shown; yet the steps of our lives are also mitigated, or subject to rules and policy. 
            <br>&emsp;The point then is comparable to the base argument of orderly or not nature, whereby everything past that is a subject of one or the other; yet, of those subjects, in reference to their base stand, can be regarded by the pratcial and common norms of such topic. In that, our base concern is whether governance is needed at all. And as nothing in the world appears to be unorderly, or of any favor if so, so do we see the need for governance if agriculture, policing and courts are of interest. The shades and hues of taxes though or other domestic affairs are more unique and questionable. We can, to be clear, address what is best when it comes to those fundemental affairs; yet, in these minor ones, the affairs themselves can be addressed -and the according resolve. Perhaps, in short, we can argue over the ways that the institution for security, goods and justice are upheld, but not so much as we agree with governence will we question whether such groups are warranted. In regards to the bureuas for child services, transporation, commerce (of a non-base sort), and that of intelligence, education, censorship etc., these, although admittedly our ignornace has no point past the acceptance of these at some base level, can still afford scrutiny and suggestion to the nature of their existence; for they, in some sense, seem to be products of the general prescence of government, as if offspring to something we deem essential. In other words, how Zeus, Hades and Poseidon operate is up for debate, but their stature is there so much as Gods are needed. But as for Ares, Artemis or any of the demigod offshoots, these are but extensions of those, and thus subject to baser inquiries and doubts.

        <div id="falseends">
            I believe my writing would be enough, as would our view of the sun and moon, where and when I am. My family is getting old, and being near that is both warming and important. Nor is there a lack of things which typically come where there are people. 
            <br>&emsp;We built our efforts so high on a pedastool, that bringing them forward never felt suitable, nor fitting. "What, will we have to go through this arduous process, only for them not to get it! No, our words are great, and be it my life it takes, we will go about it so that they are fully said and grown." I don't know why this is neccessary. I suspect theres this fleeing seperation, the crux of it all I think, where you feel like the world is ending, and you've let them down. You might even pretend like your dying, as to catch their notice.
            <br>&emsp;I think the better course is one where you take your preferred step, and do so without much baggage or prestige, whereby you take them firmly and through, because that groove is what you want, to be, fully: and it need not be a purer means to  false ends. Find out where you could go, to be, and if offering ceratin advice, or remedying your ruffled view is what you seek, then go for it. But your broader regard needs a sincere assessment. For, if the world is foolish, so is our demise natural. And if it doesn't have to be, then at least know what would be good. Your posterity doesn't matter, nor man's reign; your not giving up. And yes, they are all moving on, because your stopped, afraid, trying to bring yourself forth in a way that leaves you unexposed; yet, in that, you also see suffering, or a solution at least; and less you solve that, you don't earn your chance, your destiny and fame.
            <br>&emsp;I guess our reproached state holds certain truths; as if the world is not so full of problems, but rather we are poor. Yet, there are issues, or things to maintain and cultivate at least; and at any rate, there is alot being said, or at least alot which you could here. This takes away your levelled view, and asks you to be present; but you know not what that is. In fact, your view is one, of grandiose, destiny and recognition, whereby you foster the truth, and let it glow; yet, where and when, and how, will that happen? Is it not going to be the same initial step? I think overall your reservation is one of learned fear, in that what was right could not be where others were; yet you have not been then; which leaves you feeling either responsible or abandoned by the world. Removing this from being the case, in that you assimilate, and let the natural course of problems flow, you then would be stuck in your ordinary ways. You may be bold, and otherwise find something important such as mere volunteering, but it is of you, from you, be it good, local, or perhaps misfortuned. There lies our doubt, our fear, in that upon letting go of these reservations, we will be withotu the purpose we sacrificed everything for, and thus lacking the latter too. We have our interest though, the driving factor by which our restrictions and fear caved around. Theres a genuine draw, curisoity and good when it comes to nothing, rest, violence and expression. There is, and that can be the mark which drives you where you go. I do know however that your time as one has led to an all encompassing response, both in that oracle responsability, and according response of fleeing to doom; but you can tell the truth, as can you martial your knowledge and sense like they were those things that your youth already implores. Honesty is just like accounting, and the resolve is easy. But curiosity combined with our immature edge, leads me to an overall meaning, and as such the infedility of our arguments and position. There seems to be problems, or at least what I seek is not bound well enough in what would be in fact local too me. "As if the universe were the subject of my painting hand." This is fine, and like building a home, attending sessions for school, or the mere act of doing chores, definition and regard can be given to these broader things, no matter the souce. Beacause again, there is nothing so primarily poor here, only a dishonest address, as our time has in one or the other, bent us away from society in any genuine way, and thus a strained sincerity of being ourselves. These are what I want to do; but the truth of the matter runs  contrast to your views otherwise, which then have you twisitng and resisting your course and strides ahead.
            <br>&emsp;Pretend there are no problems, merely influence, and that you are nothing special, only yourself. All the action that is merritable, is what comes from that latter; and be it in the regard of others or you personally, it is still from you, and for that alone. If you help, entertain, or delight, so will others bring such experience down their own path. Of friends and lovers, these require little more than your complexion. "And are you trying to establish sums for the sake of a women and a few friends? Or, is it better put that such stakes seem to earn you the world, but sincerely in that, you hope to be the source of earning those friends? Why not just go right for them, as all are eligble nearby; nor is anything required beyond yourself, as is there no special benefit (in these respects) from being the ruler of the world." In fact, the reason your dreaming, is that if you are in fact all mighty in yourself, than those who are your friends will be so of who you are fully -since that is the mark which their drawn for. Yet isnt that the problem, that you must be so bold and attractive to have a sincere connection; why can you not be so in a common way? For, the insight here is that wihtout those friends and lovers, your unhappy -as this is quite a human condition. Yet, is there in fact something special about who falls in that line, or is it only fair and ripe if what you have, is to you when you are truly who you are. Theres an effect of trauma though, as who are has come into a place which it was uncomforatble being; and as you were unhappy not being with others, all while wishing to remain yourself (integrity), you held a plan which would procurr so, for at least you felt good about your destination and approach. The truth though, is that such end is not required for what you seek, which is to have friends who are so to me, truly. Not only is there unneccessary aspects in being famous, well recieve and notable to recieve friends; these are garnered by communication, similarities in tastes and trust; this is not procurred in any special way beyond you simply being comfortable. But I don't know who I am then, for, my actions are not so clear in their value, as we don't know what were fighting for. Perhaps it is so that we are without problems when we are strong and stout, but what has this to do with having  friends? Aren't my actions for the sake of those? Why is there something you have to be anyway, considering, that per a condition, it is right when you have friends: and is that strong and stout man really a requitment for those?

            For the sake of a small comment, I can say with much firmness, that if the world has no problems, then we are in no need to save it, and as such offer our righthous response. Instead, we are dealt the all too honest appraisal of our worth and time, and view things in and of themselves. Being acquintained with others seems a neccesity, particularly from yoga and church; though, additional things of interest are wortwhile. Minor things such as zoom calls and off shoot meetups can be additional, though some repition is required for a lasting prescence to occrue -as you may otherwise feel like your avoiding them, and thus exempt from their wares. Still, both United and Buddha offer a pleasing and concurrent service; and although yoga is fairly expensive, so is the weekly session a great thing; and as the weather improves, we can scooter to cheap drop ins. And other invovlemtns such as the Hu gathering, or singles meetup. I make no promise of joining the compassion call tomorrow, or any day for that matter; but I do see the worth of dropping by the meditation following our yoga session, to say hi at least and establish a friendship. "One, where you could choose to arrive or not, but be fair in your return; as showing up to too little means that no impact is in place, and your return will be following a missing state, rather than one of pleasant surprise." Perhaps next week we'll plan on the compassion as well as stopping by; and regarding the coffee on wedensday, I have pretty much got what I seek; though, the brief and clean nature of it is somewhat rewarding, nor any bit overwhelming.
            <br>&emsp;I think that as we set ourselves apart, we feel there is some issue worth saving; almost as if that is our way back, as savior. It seems, on the other end mind you, that everyone is in fact fine, and proceeding abut their way; which, in an irrational sense can be contrived under the thrusts of porn, the pedantic nature of discourse, or the charming meanness of self help and schemes. Beyond that, the preferred insight is that you are only keeping yourself back, and in turn without cause or course to save anything. For instance, I look at David Hume, and how I see him I must remark how we'd be great if we were the same; yet it is not notoriety which holds our bend; but rather the actualization of work and prestige of that class; hereby we do feel well about ourselves, but it is mostly from the good we find in our work. This is not bent on what such caliber will recieve us, only that such caliber was in fact present. I feel similarly about sums, nature, rest, leisure, craft, care and film. And as there is no problem to solve, merely a strolling world, you can take these inhabits, and breeze nicely through the world, as if there were a prescence of good that earned you a smile, the freedom to see, the ease to share and openly connect. And by and large, be it for creative and exciting ends, or to do something cool and impactfull, it is through your excitement and itnerest that such actions are drawn, as opposed to a pre-requisite for seomthing meaningfull.And admittedly, I do not see that, in a volunteering sense. My life is not so positioned. And again, I have no aim or resolve to contrivance or fear, but I do see things that draw our attention. Generally, church and other kinds of gatherings, yoga as a service and cultural interest, social groups (who are local); orbiting this is select trades, workshops, atheletics, writing events or submissions, pro-active dating, communicating our memoir and interest in gaming, and perhaps other local and or foregin possibilities of where our interest could go. It is worth noting our peculiar place, in that before we wished for things which would alleivate stress in our principle ways; while now, as that princple has less reserved stakes, so are we assimilating more, and comfortably, with a future thats bright, or shining at least. So, looking at working abraod for its own sake, holds little when I consider theres no interest in leaving. In fact, it is enough for me to dream and see the bounds of Vancouver; which holds both the current place I'm at, where my family lies, and the outright beauty that is not even fully known; and even then, I am still present for those which I return to see. Theres no where special or reminsiecnet of any notoriety where you'll go; London, France, India or Japan, these are but of interest to you; yet we are already pleased, and not given much fortune more than making that interest work: it weighs comparably though to what I've already claimed. Still, that initial point was based on what may be scanned or learned of, and perhpas there is some oppertunity in Asia to study, practice and teach near and around the culturue of Yoga or Buddhism. But you can see then, that you are not running from your discontent, or moving forward for the sake of furnishing your ambitions -which are in fact only based on acquiring what is basic. Instead, theres something which you actually want to do. And I see that in Vancouver.  Although Kamlooops has its own, I see us leaving, for settling in and growing out of our place as to spread further into heavier things, takes time and thus somewhere you can extend from. This is not what Kamloops is, despite its common interests. We have low responsability though, and quite a bit of novelty and delight. Paired with our able particpants, and we are quite furnished and secure. And our writing, gaming, film and long form, stretching, running, wholeomse eating and generally flow down the dropping path, is fair and residing.

            I feel, perhaps, that as I am educated, with sense and of character, that other peoples suffering and or the misdeeds of others, draws my intervention. And, fairly, our generous ability is brought so much, that the motion feels good. Better yet, of praise for instance, is more drawn out from the preceding actions; whereby rest is probally all I was gratefull for following a war.
            <br>&emsp;I only mean to slighten our purpose, in that before it felt so remarkable and ordained; which admittedly came from the hopes we had from so, though this was more reflective of our wish to get the relations we seek, while in control. "As if our rise to power would attract others." 
            <br>&emsp;Without this though, it is not so clear on what we should do. One active sentiment is this notion regarding our concerns for life, rather than positon. As it were, we seem to have ambitions that reflect the response of the world around, be it of excitment or fear. But this is quite too present, and thereby drawn out to a far off end whereby those grander points can be see. I know not what lies there, for instance, in the functioning of our government, or any sound view of nuclear weaponry or global climates. I can say however, that these far off arrangments are poorly placed, and that as much as being more spread out and closer aimed makes you uncomfortable, so is that but a mark of your prevailing safe contrivances for longed desires.
            <br>&emsp;In being more loose, in that our strides are not so strictly firm and nearby, we have a longer hold in terms of where the present lies. And in that, the future seems both approachable, but closer in its absolute. "As if upon compressing the lens, more concentrated amounts of light can shine; yet, their reach is nearer than those far off extremes of entirety -which itself, was held when the lens was broad enough to cover all,but in the mere current moment." 
            <br>&emsp;All I mean to say, and I will admitt these are the regressions of a man, that in this denser yet more common state, so are our interests and scales for approval made. Our life being important, seems to offer reason and rights from Churhc, Yoga, meetups and discsussions. Trades and submission follow suite, though their place holds more saturation as time runs further ahead. In meeting that, our local life has widened, in our utility, leisure, merrit of provsions and their duty, and garnished by those surrounding affairs, and those which offer their prompts for commitment. Friendship then is consumed or desired; but in that you are without guilt or yearning impressions: for not but what could be and is, holds your mind: while a lack of that sees everything as suitable.
            <br>&emsp;The cats are old, but not yet dying; though I do see Dora going soon. Dad has surgery, followed by a May long trip. Then were able to move. They may move, and I hold no regard till the summer anyways. But I only see that as an easy transition; while otherwise, returning to a point of stbaility garnered by ourselves, and housed with all those additions seems both fair and enticing. Achievable and manageble too. Not much else is required; for our efforts for friends gives us what were internally seek; and so much as that is, or is being angled towards, so will our interest and privilage be sat on and forwarded with clear and sincere intentions. By that, we may be more open, and in turn earn the means for more; and so much as we try, we can at least feel little when we fail; for our success elsewhere is but given station, prior to that successfull attempt. In other words, whats to be expected and strode from, is that point and place which is where your forward efforts are from. And here, we have the means and ability to produce what we seek; while our success outwards is but a benefit for that, an advantage, sweetener, or right softener perhaps. But we are still otherwise fed, full and pleased. Further satiation then needs no fear, as we are already ripe; yet in that, we can at least be unreserved or afraid if an opperunity or inclination passes by, where the result is eithe rthe same -with such fineness- or we proceed -which is fairly more. But we are thus free to be the same. "As if there were a proper exchange, and all we needed and sought was present; yet additions just mean more; but so are we fine to earn only that, and not fret or be undetailed 
            about other currencies."

        <div id="ourwriting">
            So we have been mending our stance on publishing, and in the shortest regards, I can say theres an oppertunity for me to try. Formality is important, and I do think some preperation, or development at least of civil writing would go along way; similar in fact to our station at church, and our interest in strenghtening our vocal quality. At any rate, the avenues seem varied; as one can have a youtube channel of these sorts, bent on varying degress of intention, so are there various outlets, and formatts at least, for we may simply submitt individual essays, or smaller parts of the collection at that.
            <br>&emsp;I can say, happily, that our understanding of the collection is that it is a cheerfull sort of reflections and deliberation. It is not so much a memoir, as it is more firm and declarative; but so are there inquiries and questions regarding the merrit and facts relevant to such judgements. 
            <br>&emsp;Furthermore, I can account for our interest in doing it at all; better yet, I'd describe our interest at the moment as one of solidifiny what we have so far said, as we can then share. On top of that, there are many things which I have not yet said; and in that course we are still thinking and defining, prior at least to our written claim. In that, if we mean to share, be it for esteem or a given prompt, those things which reflect or more forward and whole-hearted claim, is yet to come, and in prior to being stated at all. This is fine, and I am in fact quite honored and pleased with that being course. "Such objects fit my felicious stride." But regarding what we do in fact have, there is not so much clear in whats been said, as the development there is more in line with tuning of instruments, whereupon we practice with them then create. The point being, that what we had to work with, or fiddle around prior to firm statements, was impure itself, or untuned as it were. There are notes though, and many songs which have come as both a youthfull result of our more integrated times. And, right now, I am finding that such tunes and rhymes or pleasing to remedy, and at least fortify into something beyond their rambling selves. In that, there is actually much which has been said; or, to continue the analogy, much which has been played. Naturally, as remakrs any in a novice step, our furthest products were reminsinect of any equally novice form of labor. Not so much to do with the ability reached, but our sense and interest as reflects our coming course, has me tending back to the steps prior, and at least tying them up as to be more complete, albeit of a partial self -or novice rather.
            <br>&emsp;Our strides then color themselves with the interest of care and esteem, whereby the ideas we have, and within their written form, breathes more life and reaches towards more in its shine: thats our stride. But the object of this is unclear; for we are not so privy to money's offer, nor are we looking for some resounding affect. In fact, I see the world broken up in both an overarcing civil layer, and that of the commons; yet in each, there are seperations of judicious, industrious and playfull sorts; and all so with nodes and sectors, or families if you will. I see our route not so much in finding who will bring me across the masses, but rather that one, be it the leader or member, who ingratiates me into their particular strand, due to our work resignating, and the interest to incorporate and extend its effects within such strand. "As if we had accounting skills, and someone, seeing the use and value, brought said person in to display such skills, and therein further the group through this newly fitted stride." Thats where I should go. And be as it may, but starting there in a smaller kind, will breathe more life and station into your steps, whereby the light they cast will be to others in their own kind, and so forth. 
            <br>&emsp;A team unites to form a buisness, which then influences of buisness of that kind; these then spread to other types of buisness in that field, in that a class of sports coaches translates to the class of personal training, and there on to the field of fitness and health in general. And upon reaching those civil heights, to all below will it rain. This is our objective at least, for it more plainly reflects our strides of esteem and oppertunity. Because our aimed is banked little on money though, or wandering hopes for infamy and posterity, or fears of insecurity and integrity, the objective holds less concern or deliberate routes for the masses; or the idea of the broader public. Instead, we care more about the ideas and their esteem, or value rather, and as such, where theres room and reason to try -as our strid is marbled with little fear of dissapointment- we go for the hope and claim of instigating such result; which, as fitting, finds itself so in a smaller, personal, common level group; which, in circumpsect, can be soley from yourself, whereby you present yourself and share. Or, in the case for yoga, you are at least sound to feel known and fitting as your true selve, a good one, which itself sprouts from that care and concern for words and ideas; and, similarly, our stride of principle and living has objects of a similar accord; be it in those groups which you acclimitate towards and contribute, or those  mere invovlements whereby the common affairs and practices of character are shown. One, remakrs further life in what you have so far become; while the other, affords more for you to take in, or be present towards; as a bar is unfitting, so are those which are so, because you can truly be, take in and recalibrate; and otherwise, they may actually approve of your offer, or humor it at least, whereby more is done. And we fear not, because, the worst, is that we go back to living is we happily find, and breathing our own light; church and community bare warmth and structure towards this, while those objects of oppertuinty and esteem, flourish on your constanty ability and openess as comes from such habitation.

        <div id="upanddown">
            Things are well, though my short prescence stops me from seeing all of it. In that, we long for things which would relieve us; or better said, our natural condition feels like something were bracing for, rather than striding along, with tender strenght. By that, we are somewhat outside ourselves, unable to draw our taughtness and sensibility; whereby our fortune feels more weighing, thus drawing our gaze outside to further things, or at least places and scenarios with less strain. Oddly, this feeling has no real place, for virtue has us content with the muck that we have, nor is there much dispostion or experience that says we are permanetly short. In that, theres fleeting hopes as to relive our muddied state; but due to our aim elsewhere, or at least unhumored oblige, we feel absent of those things -ie. people, travel and infamy. 
            <br>&emsp;Now, over the years this up and down pace has had me somewhat stultify those latter interests; which in terms of how they were viewd, was fine. Only, in the recent days, they have governed a more homely interest. That is, in our time so far, we've leaned too much on perfection; and so those things of interest and desire felt contrary, or scrutiably unimportant. Only now, our need to be so perfect has reduced, and at any rate, the more appropriate manner in which we pursue and enact ourselves, holds ample room for those other interests. 
            <br>&emsp;For so long those priorities of ours were banked on reaching something far; or at any rate, developing those efforts to be so well, that there aim of according gains was wise to infer. As their stakes lowered, our life could gain more fertile traction; and as it were, we went from an inconsistent perfection, to a regular period of greatness, satisfied with merely good, more void of bad, and easier achievments and progress to an accumulative acclaim, all while bolstered and engraved to the warmth of community, its structure, and the affibility and steadfastness to oppertunity and friends. As it were, we use to make the heartiest of steps, but would eventually come down to something either absent or subpar, all before waring ourselves thin in the return to such might. Whereas now, we take comparable strides, though more evenly paced; and when were done, we have more ease in sinking back a little, along with being more content and pleased in our common attentions. Thust, we graze more woafully, then return to that ample state; which, in its own way, stands on more even ground, as compared to those perfect strides which had to begin their actions on the rubble of inconsistency. In effect, we take more stpes as we take less futile breaks; and due to this consistency, our paces are done more meaingfully, as their advance is not from a return, but continuation.
            <br>&emsp;In summary, I have not been to church in two weeks; nor was I able to go to Shambhala. It, along with Yoga were missed due to the weather, but I must then reflect that being somewhat absent, comparably at least to the two weeks prior, has me feeling this seperate haze; which, although not a detriment, as our normal pace is quite plain, so are we more recessed and driven to be with ourselves: which is itself a ridge that passes us along to those required perfections, and according futility. Showing up then seems to major task, as reception is quite circumstantial; and at any rate, your communication can be easy and swell, be it forwardly or in response. Like a relationship, it takes time to build, and the worth comes from doing so. At least, you can attest to your less than eager state, or at least the disposition and integration that has not normalized itself. Our pace is not re-routing, as the truths which brought us here remain. I am merely reflecting the differemce, as if the choice was not ours and we are simply apprecitaive of our return, or at least what this prevention held us from.

        <div id="markofsuccess">
            Consistency, or constancy as those aspiring refer, could not be overvalued as a marker of success. In fact, as positivty roots itself as the core factor of aims, so would constancy calibrate the peculiar truth of any given subject.
            <br>&emsp;Regarding Men, we state that the former principle neccessitates that a result will be bent towards something positive, at least. The point being, that whether it is thievery or philanthropy, that the end would at least be a good one; which, as it happens, further justifies itself under the regularity, flavor and ease of the result. Here then consistency lies. For none would argue that a result was superior if it in fact held less frequency and ease; and in terms of one's ability to procurr so, can more or  less be decided on the congeniality of themselves and the operation at hand, and judged whether such pairing, and of that fruitfull kind, is consistent.
            <br>&emsp;In other words, the general posivitvity in which all things are aimed, and the properties of frequency, substance and simplicitiy which refine the quality of such results, specifies itself under any given scenario, by judging somethings worth, or affibility in a given case, as to whether their nature and that of the conduct, is consistent enough to procurr those defined factors. Perhaps, in a word, consistency is so, that if one were to partake in a venture, that their results would be regular, pleasing and efficient. In that, we would say that something was not consistent if in fact the result diverged from such properties. 
            <br>&emsp;Put another way, the elements of success are so, that no matter the scenario, that all ends would hold such complexions. This is an overacving mold, with positivty being the foremost, and frequency, substance and ability reflecting the meat of the matter. But general no less. What constancy refers to, is along the lines of screening, or inquiry at least, as to what things one ought to do; under the notion that, those which we choose, were so, seeing as our amendment to such would lead to a solid affair with the highest kind of end -in that it held those qualities. In short, what I can do well is that what I can do consistently; and that what I ought to do, or must do, is that which I cannot be inconsistent with, without ceasing those qualities on our basic level. For instance, we must breathe by virtue of lacking any frequency of life when we do not.
            <br>&emsp;I think the idea is a sound one, but needs more plotting. At any rate, I would conclude on this speculative summary, which is constancy's place as a determining factor; as if we were to decide which acts we would partake within the realm of all acts, and how they are generally defined against those core properties -of frequency, flavor and ease.  Constancy is the scale by which we judge what things we could forever partake, in order to reach those goods of general quality.

            So for many years I dreaded the winter, as time would feel so still, and our anticipations, or lacking, would be more weighing on me. In that, I always looked forward to the summer; and at any rate, planned things accordingly to its arrival, and otherwise avoided trasnitioning or committing to things amidst the winter.
            <br>&emsp;Now, I can fully see that the colder months are not lacking in goodness, nor are their setbacks that severe. In fact, the extreme cold of december is comparable to the extreme heat of July: but these are to natural and thus fair. At any rate, our time has improved whereby the colors and temperature of the year don't impact us in any significant way. I am sure that if this were to retract, then the closed in points of winter would feel as they once did. But our constance is upward in that sense. Moreover, in regards to the actually good, or sweetness of the year, so do those shivering months have their own strands. As it were, the land becomes barren, lifeless, thin; yet, in that, the sun, and all light in general, penetrates everything to a vibrant effect. Such saturation makes the evenings glow, and the mornings. This compounded with the general briskness and 'icy moor' appearl of the cold, makes for something, albeit crisp and in need of bundling, is quite fresh and exact. While the summer months have a more radiating haze, these cooler months offer ones which harsh edges, but of a pleasing and shiny sort. It is true that the joys of spring carry over into the summer; but my point overall is that the lows of winter are not as much when we are clear in our sight, nor are their highs that low, considering the vibrancy on display. 
            <br>&emsp;In effect, the fall has nothing sparse about it, as its depletion of life, in itself a great scene, has no coming detriment; so you may incorporate to the retreat of life, bare its fairness, thank your own commisery, and otherwise enjoy. In that, be it the outgrowth into spring or the midst of summer, theres nothing to work around; for what is good is always around the corner; nor is the advance into milder times so unfavarable, that you directly defer from it, or come short of the ease required (during it) to see the spring ahead. All is the same then. Not worth unaccounting for, but nothing to hold you back, or feel like a stop is coming. It is true that this year had but a minor stretch (and a late one at that) of cold then snow; but prior to that, the times were pleasant, and quite open in their offers -as their severities were not at all prominent. And even now when they are, like the heat it is but a temporary phase, so do the pleasing hues remain. 
        </div>
        <div id="thefront">
            I can see three elements of my life, those being health, committments and industry. That former, is utmost in the most basic of ways; as our negligence of the latter two don't permitt any slack in this. That is, if we are free enough not to worry about activity or friends, so are we still subject to the approval by our fitness. In that, I see how substance will accrue and our natural standards will accomodate. As it stands though, if those measures are not so severe, you still have industry in mind; for if our state of exercise permitts a great deal of starch and grain, so do our creative activites suffer. That being said, the need for such activites to be in place, and somewhat prominent, is dictated by the abscene of other pleasures and security. At the very least, it seems, our release from perfection allows us to attend other services and events, and from that be seen, and at least proposed -as to give something to look forward to, some structure. And so our liberal efforts have more room, beyond the width, to act as we truly seek, as their bend is not so twisted for the hopes and aspiration of grandiosity or non-idleness. 
            <br>&emsp;What I am noticing though, is that as those warming committments take place, and our leiusre affords more permission, so does the lack of clarity to those liberal ways draw an interest in the fruits of those social attendances. There, a pleasure unlike that of liberality is shown, and we are not struck to another path as not to be sparked by it. 
            <br>&emsp;I think we've begun to realize that things are good when they are in and of themselves. And as we are fit, so can the extent of that comply. We're just simply outside the realm of reservation, procastination or excuse, and as such, can move more freely and a foresight of preferred action, 'rather than the promise of beginning'. But in this, we are not so sure what were doing, or why at any rate. There is this element of sameness, in that our time of relaxation sees those social comforts, but lacks any regard or sense as to their requirments. And that cannot be an unimportant point; as despite our current invovlement with industry and craft, so is their a general favor when it comes to them, as compared to the committment of furthering those social ends. This isn't to say that time and sincerity won't procure such forms of that end; but to see so without considering the extent to which you'd go, in its ease that is, and whether or not you can spare the time, is folly.
            <br>&emsp;Were still making something up, as if there isn't something pleasing already. In reality, the warmth of another, and of an intimate sort beyond the common comforts of friends, is within the range of our severed reservations. The notion of travel though, or the paired fantasy of notoriety and its offer, seem outside of this realm. This seem more like fiddling motions, or idly drawn ones at least. Whereas those other feel more like improvements that can be targeted, and born for the sake of your life. "While those other foreign and exocitc ones, seem more like a life in its own, but farther, and with the hope that you'd reach. While our current stead, is one that removes the constrictedness from such intent, and otherwise allows for liberty to go as she's meagerly pleased, while you fortifiy and bend through the life currently around you; whereby the hope for honesty and friends is recieved."
            <br>&emsp;In other words, the ability to garnish a home, is simple; as is the acquisition of love and friends but an itinery's respect away: for in that you can see, and are knonw. Nor is the development of a craft a massive effort; for with the right selection of both growth and trade, so can you be prompt to the integration that the internet rewards; whereby you can in a similar fashion become known, and thereby ask, explore, and trend towards points and positions that will give you substanct and posterity. In regards to books and travel, I cannot say the latter is cheap, or without seperation if you amend to its offer; while the former seems limited only by your fear of dissapointed, and ability to write a letter. Content in general seems the reward those who are consistent; and seeing as this is an evergrowing spot for oppertunity and fufillment, an inch is substantial. It seems beneath this sits our integral means and delighted ends; at least our leisruely and past times which have no short ease or amount to offer. But far in front, sees perhaps window dressings of these elements, which lose their non-competivieness, natural attitude and gait, and overall personal, directed and unimposed figure. That is the problem with women, money, travel and acclaim. As in the going to dinner, riding in a car, sitting in chairs, or meagerly submitting your books, offering your interests, sharing your hobby or creation, none are bad. But in a state which is either too idle and stiffened, so do we magnify where those front end things go, and thus stretch out our common steps in the back. "Which in effect, gives them less room to wander and grow."
            <br>&emsp;The problem though, is that as the front has governed mroe width, and accordingly settled, so are we unsure where our efforts should go, or at least what objectives we should have. I may be nieve, but relations are not built past much more than similarity and connection; and being open seems the limit of that, rather than the shortcomings of which someones fears may see you as having. The honest remark of me from another is the scale by which our own remarks align. This takes time though and familiarity. And, nicely, this is no problem, as our posture and pace is not so hasty or in drought; as we otherwise show up with ourselves, happy, pleased, and in effect honest. This is merely a point for cheer, which in my regards seems sufficient as a general point of secutiy, but also intimate promise. I would say, in effect, that our reservations from the back, magnify the heights of our life in front, if and only if to allow for such pleasires to accrue. For we dont really mean to travel, but if it seems like we'd be more desirable for another, then to that pleasure I move. And at any rate, I am jealous from the view of another going, 'as if they have such magnified riches'. In effect, our drawn out ends afford our own hopes to be spread out and stiff, and also subject to comparison and self invovlemtn, whereby the in fact regal motion of someone, in travel or in their buinsess, is not in fact so grand and remisniscnt of what you've dreamed. And you feel unneccarsily inferior. Perhaps an overall sentiment from our rounded place, which is not so dug or or drawn out, but more promptlya  and plumply abounds in its front and back. An overall view of our life then may seem important; as their may feel like things ought to be done, as reflect that truth: which our new found stability and happiness is keen to respect: yet the demand is not clearly known. "So our intent is to later define this."

            So theres this ppint of frustation that often comes up during suggestions, where you here 'just do it, look over there how great so and so is', along with comparisons of others who are. My issue, is that theres a rose tinted glasses effect, almost as if the vision being professed is coming from a place which has no color itself. Of course over there is fine; and how could it not be, when our current spot has nothing comparable. "As those who are in fact there an accompanied, settle into what is present, and otherwise look at the colors elsewhere." 
            <br>&emsp;In that though, I see little of importance in any unique way. All that really changes is the flavor of imagery and activity; but in all places are these things still found. Nor, in all likelihood, have you experienced all, or incorporated what your current position has. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, I see little importance for the sake of these varying hues, as no where, and in fact where we are, lacks any vibrance itself: and so it all feels novel.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, the suggestion of working online, or furthering your civil stead, is one that fairs benefit in all regards, despite the unneccesary transition. That is, even if the far of promise of adventure and change is in fact breif and comparable, so in your own familiar state is their room for improvemnt. For as we said, in our land there is much to see, be it new or mariniating. But so do the civil elements of the wprld smear this, or at least bend your able ways. 
            <br>&emsp;Our course of effort though is one that submitts to priority; for as we said, of course I'd like to be King of England, as the lack of labor and access to wherever I seek, would in fact confurr pleasures and scenery. Yet such a post is both heavy and distant as it is large. And regarding our actual purpose, it is to live well; and in that, there is not much which is exclusive. Yet, in that register of spots, despite their fair fit of you as a man, so are you subject to the requirments of being one. Here, the civil reality of trade, buisness, liberty and recreation come into play. "And some angles are preferable over others."
            <br>&emsp;Values come into play though, as our common life of industry and care, surely improves when our means for provision are acquired more gently and efficently. While, someone may have a more equitable stance on their life, but work more to provide it: still, such means may be more lucrative, however much more their demands are. 
            <br>&emsp;My point, is that as a man, I see, and so much as I am unhindered do I heed such prompts. Hereby, we are not working to remove troubles, or survive at any rate, but using our time, with fecundity, bearing down on nothing more than that which draws the beat of our heart, some craft in our pace.
            <br>&emsp;Seeing as their are conditions, we can define the removal of those as freeing; while the harmony and grace within the duties you have, can be liberating: as they don't weigh you down, or cause struggle, and despite being present, are not a burden. In effect, I see the former improvement as one wihch expands what you can see, for you are relieved fundamentally; while the latter, holds more means for you to actually respond. "For you may see the whole world in all your kingship, but be unable to at all treat it; while those, more common, may not be able to see everything to its greatest extent, but so can their harmony with such demands, confer the liberal means for generous effort: whereby, onto what stands shorter than that which can only be seen on those high towers, earns a larger treatment." In a word, freedom is made by managing the world, as we contrive and alter as to find a better angle, whereby we improve the levelness of our place. Whereas liberality remarks the man, the use, the sentenced; as their poor response to riches yeilds according results, while those who treat even the gravest of threats well, keep their hearts full and beating. "And thats what we care about, our meausre, the scale for approval." And the point is nto that freedom is irrelevant, but that ultimately, our death and civil lives always remain, to which our response is needed. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps that is a developmental insight, whereby our submission to a given requiremnt of strenght, in that it is a statr which is needed, reveals to me how things are and who we should be while I am so appropriate. If we were compeltely free, and perhaps farily as our oblige to death did not appear as someone ignored trouble, then maybe our composure would need little. But even then, what would we seek? For the point is not that we'd go away, as respiration would still be refreshing, as would sugar taste sweet. And even if there were no consewuences for to much of one and too little of the other, so would be be subject to a preferred experience? Maybe not, as that somewhat suggests that there are confinements which mark a nature and its congenial way. But so could we rest on the predicate given by bodies, in that they would be exposed to the world in a consequential way, in and how they (the bodies) were material. In that we can say that we are; and the notion of being exempt from freedom, suggests that you are not. But in that, there is not an experience to be had: at least there is no beat of yours to move from: particularly in that there is no one (in your abscence) to respond. "And neither that or the exemption from advancing (forward as compared to receptiopn) can be so (absent), and life have any presence -for those things would then be there."
            <br>&emsp;Breifly, I can say that our liberal interests are more clearly so, and thus without the direst need to make us free. In that, we can afford more regard for things which would in fact relieve us. Nor, to my point, is that with any compramise for those liberal ends. Had perfection been their right, then so would all things contrary fail; yet it is not so, but only where our definite mark heeds the inspired taste which strikes our treated heart. That is fine, meaningfull and subsistent. The concern though, is how much other things require, in that you surely can see improvements there as you would the sweetness of sugar; and while that latter still sits outside our functioning realm, so is the comittment and profit from furthering our profession or craft within our bounds. 
            <br>&emsp;Admittedly, we are mixed in terms of our pure efforts, as their roots are in acquiring the lenenacy to do them. And although that severity has reproached, or more gentle efforts still hold our indsutrious gate. In our fatigue, we in fact have a weary heart, rather than a beating one. I won't speak to others suggestion, but I can at least say that freedom feels desired; for our return seems to require it. But, as we said, that absent state is more than no from a hasty and strenuous attempt to be with it more. "Which brings you to an eventual stop." What I can say of this, is that as our sight has opened, so have we seen what was previously held from fear of missing that relief, and otherwise pinned under our procastination. In that our writing stands and its earnest submission. Yet in that, I see much patience, repose and civility in making such attempts: the campaign of which, we wear has me pruning to forog. I have not the steadfastness or moral gait to proceed; as this feels like a chore. This is so, again, because our ease of effort is quite low, particualry in this vulnerable states where you route to success is in trying repeatedly, but with a tender confidence that merely seeks to promulgate, but holds no ends so dear that your afraid to hear critique, dissmisal, or a further call to effort. We need to reach there and we simply are not. I can say, in circumspect, that our efforts down this course are coming together for this point of submission to occur. But as we are tired, so is it not so easy to try; and in that, we are also working on things in the meantime; at least so much as our gentle approach is out of reach, so is our moment of focus too burdened with idle work and progress. For there is much to do; at least, when I think of the substance which centers within those outward effords, there is room to grow. Yet, beyound perfection and our more common piece, it is that outward edge of sincerity, promulgation, steadfastness and personal insight (as to the importance of spreading our ideas), that marks the challenge at had. For in that, you must be bold and establioshed, but lightly and within the broadest sort. That is hard to reach when we are in fact so stirn; and although our general breadth and lightening has reveald these spots to me, and preliminariyl progressed, so is the home stretch of it outside our bracing realm.
            <br>&emsp;Sending letters should be easy, as there is no test in question, or means rather, but the end itself, whereby you implore whats signifanct: succeeding in your attempt to solidify the life you've already had. Whereas a profession brings room to acquire such life, be it in liberality or experience. And admittedly, our strain within our hidden attempts to liberally succeed, does have me unprivy to the elegance that is only required to further its claim. Your alright though. Theres no one asking you for much. Nor is the need for furthe expansion a pressing one. And, in its case and that of our creation, so are details and alignment a natural guarentee to succeed, particualry when you have that strenght and elegance to move forwardly through it. I only can consider that in this worn out statte, that we cannot see our life in general; as if those most concentrat points loosened up, found their place, and we were otherwise left more expressed, open, meaning to love. And by that, there is room for freedom to have benefit, and for us to see as such and punctually amend. Were just where we are though, reaching a point where the world is no longer on our shoulders. "In our reprieve and might, ought we merely stand."

        <div id="hardends">
            The developental approach is a hard one, for you at most reflect on what you've experienced so far, and conclude based on that. This is in contrast to a theoretical approach, whereby you amend yourself based on rules: yet of what origin I do not know.
            <br>&emsp;Our reflective course is one that affords itself a plain product, particularly so due to its respect for subjects. That is, it knows little what nature wants, but at least knows what nature is; and in effect, she asks us nothing more than to respond to whats in front of us. And, as it were, our gravest fear is one of idle definitions, whereby our lack sees that local scenario as a burden. Thereby we want more, and thus we search for something beyond natures personal pledge to us, and instead her absolute state: as if we could then amend to that. 
            <br>&emsp;Foremost, is this a false hope, however understandable. But concerning whether or not is true, is where I struggle. For be it lack of our own definitions, or the struggle to even question what has yet to be clearly identified, our mind, the notion of an afterlife, and the origins of things outright, holds no conclusive place. 
            <br>&emsp;Where I struggle though, is that we are not simply adhering to what we feel to be true, but rather are questioning what that actually is. If it were true that our deaths held no judgement, and that our lives were at best configured in preferable ways, but no less of material substance, then I would, albeit limited in said material, be fair to question and resolve based on what is at hand. That is the purpose of subjects, for just as I know that red and blue differ in view, despite their unknown source, so do I know what I, as a subject, am as a man. In a word, if the whole of things is unknown, I at least can attest to the respiratory nature of a fish compared to a mammal. As things, I am doubtfull, but only on the basis of things: not the subjects. For again, we are merely attributing our worth and aims via experience. And even then, if death were passing judgement, so would that be more for us to amend to. The concern, or impediment, is in the questioning, whereby we don't know what we are even subject to. For even death would be another subject, as our mind is its product of nature's mystery. The problem though, is in the subjects. For just as hot has an effect, on us particularly, and that of cold, what is death, definitively? These curisoities sit humbly nearby the more firm and explicity truth of all things, but so is that fair for us to be unprivy too, or reproached towards. What I cannot do is overlook the nature of death, as can I not mistake the constancy of the world for something otherwise. Only, it seems at best understandable how this far peaks of inquiry, seek the absolute truth; as if the fruits of death and constancy would be hung down from comparable heights, that instead of reaching up higher, we could merely reach below from that highest peak. At this point though, we have lost reproach, and more or less abandoned an approach which better remarks the truth, in figure at least; nor are we even amending to our local affairs, per our nature as ones not from above. 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, what I am saying is that as far as proposals go, we are wrong. But in that, I am not suggesting we make proposals, but definitions rather. For no one amends to breathe, and thus makes no proposal for it. It is for things unknown which we do such things, as if a proposition which is bent on moving towards somewhere not yet known. Yet, I know not one question which is merritable beyond the truth in all things. However, in that case, we are mistaken to poorly suppose what such truth consitutes, at least without any rigor or fidelity in what its nature reflects. The point then, is that if that sole question is unknown, and our resolve to forgo dillusion holds our moment in not posturing as if we then know, then the concern for our action is how we should be without such a firm heading? That is the place for subjects then, as they, despite being unprivy to that bearing, hold relevant evidence to the nature of things in their active way. By which our thought and regard are included, and thus this inquiry and resolution. And, it is my opinion, that the reason we are so unsettled in being in this middling state, or reproached one at least, is because the impetus for wishing for truth is bound in seeking a definiton of death. Nothing more. Constancy itself even wouldn't provide this, for this at best amounts to a convincing argument that says that it (being death) could not be anything more than material, for no testimony or reasoning could suggest that things were ever inconstant; which rightly outlaws contrary's, or things which trigger inconstance, which intervention and spirits are signed.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, our definition for death is all we seek. And fairly, we might say that it is what marks our end, and thus our wish to exceed it. But this may only be so if we attest to it well, in that if it were judgement being passed, then so would our proper oblige see us pass that mark; or if it was into nothing, well so is that with its own amend: but each to pass the mark. I mean not unwind old definitions, rather I merely wish to say that what is true is in fact irrelevant, as all we really seek are the aspects most relevant to us. Imagine, if their were beings superior to us, or at least subject to conditions and ends that were more substantial that ours. Consider our nature and ways comapred to a rock, and consider us as the latter. Now, if the truth in things did in fact detail the meaning and according response for those higher, so would that same truth offer us the same. Yet, what I see, simply, and again I mean not to build up the strenght which sprouts this, but rather I only seek to explain, that such end for us, is in fact lower than what the truth in things curtails; and by that, we can know all that is worth knowing, fairly, effectively, and happily: but without the need for all, to be our scale. 
            <br>&emsp;And the trickiest thing, is in explaining why an apple is fair to be described as something as it it simply is, yet doing so without knowing the truth in things, of which it is: whereby our similar definition of death, from ignorance alone,simply holds no common description (or of subjects) like the apple, even if for both the truth is unknown.

        <div id="partandwhole">
            So I mean not to use phenomena in the Kantian sense, but that of a mystery. "Some far off light, or disturbance: that is phenomena." For one reason or the other, we tend to attribute mystical meanings to such things; while science and inquiry has progressively shown such notions to be wrong. Now, the problem, is that the whole of things is not subject to such knowledge, or clarity rather. No one truly believes, or rightly even, that the winds are the breath of God, but rather is due to the atmosphere, weather and climate in general. And in a word, this tightening of truth has spread across the bulk of the world, whereby what was once attributed to whimsy and mind, is now known to be a normal working of nature. The question though, is where she comes from? For in our own ultimate concerns, where does that align?
            <br>&emsp;What speaks to me in this regard, is that within our limit of the whole, we still act as though its subjects are of the common sort. Again, this has developed, whereby the use of rocks was likely never mistaken for God, but the weather perhaps, or illness at least. "Those things so beyond our sight, that only a mystery could show." In that sense, my querry is onto the furthest definitions wholly relevant to us. For just as red and blue are given relvant distinctions and natures, despite their limit within the unknown whole, why is death not goverened in the same way. If I removed all your electrons and bone, what would remain? You might say it was your soul, and further than that you may have a similar, but seperate, notion of the mind, as if either or both would remain. Yet I would still ask whether or not you could see, smell, breathe, feel heat, cold, sweetness; whether their could be anticipation -as measured by the beat of your heart- or aprrehension -by the tightening of your aims. If all this were absent, and your mind and soul were merely subject to what rest outside what your body delivered, what exactly would that mean. How would their be color, touch, any relevance or material that colored us with foresight or memory. In other words, what would our experience be like outside the body, when all things that we could imagine have no house to express them? "That is, how could heat be experienced, when the moment of heat is from the impartion of a source onto a body: less your mind gets hot." 
            <br>&emsp;And this is all considering the admission of mind and soul, beyond vision, speech, or the products of neurology: that beat of our heart even and all its flutters. I can't even depict what it would be like for such entity to exist outside of a material realm. And, fairly, I give little regards to material representiion, as in the contents of dreasm, and their supposed place for our mind to go. "Because the abscence of material is in no part a place where material has but mere figures, but bare. That doesn't seem to be what the wilds of matter contain."
            <br>&emsp;The problem is in our definition of mind. Even if there was an afterlife, so would our view of it being one where we inhabit some new experience, that feels slightly folly. At least the truth in it is not so comparable to such whims. But explaining then why it is something other than what feels expected of nature, is a struggle. Yet, in my own case, I see that natural description as fair; and so much as my life is garnered by wisdom and development, so are such natural ends the most favorable. For who would not want a state of peace and rest, where fear and doubt had no entrence. And even if joy and pleasure had no admission as well, so is the state of rest not tampered: for those former are not the elements of rest. In our life, the experience of such motions are what give us temporry rest, as we either settle from completed action, or sleep. But in that, such moments are in fact so preferable, for they only come when our acts of living are good, and done at that. "For my easily come to a slow, relinquishing our haste and settling in, as our prior motions have reached their mark, and our need for motion is on hold." That is the nature of bodies, they wish to move, or be even. And when they don't we feel anxious, like our inactivty is wrong. So would the abscence of a body remove that need for motion then. "Hence the salavation from this embodied world." Yet the promise of what comes after, as if our experience will be like that of a body, only without its ware. The folly in this is in thinking that the elements which are privy to a body would in fact be present when the body wasn't there. This affords no strenght in right belief, or deeming likely. What I would say instead, is how your mind and soul are when your sleeping, tranquily and freely; reminiscent lets say of bodily wisdom, whereby the choices we made served it, in the avoidance of gluttony lets say, whereby it can more easily settle, whereby its grunging need to move is no longer, and in fact our embodiment is one that happily rests -of a body'd kind that is (as comapred to the pure abscence of death). Now, think of your mind and soul and how it is when the burden that it normally has -of being embodied- is in fact administered well, and the tears of such condition are tempered. In that, our condition is comparable to death, as we are in fact without our body, in flavor at least -as it is at rest, albeit living. My only point, is that if there are desired ends of the body, yet our fear of what happens when the body is gone holds us back, so could we consider how our comparable living state to such end is in fact so pleasurable, or nice at least, that reaching said state is not worth worrying about. As most peopple have, such a transition will be a relief, into an ocean of drifting senility. Yet, it is only a developmental view that can procurr such excitment. For it is within our wisdom that our lifes actions bend us towards favorable ends. But, whereas death is final and lasting, so is our life more like a wave, whereby even our strongest repose will be subject to some moment or condition; and however well we respond, so is their a need for one. The point, is that in those moments where you do well, and your treated to a complete action and the means for rest, so can you see how this compares to your final death. And as it were, your mind is encaged by the body, and thus your choice to or wish to remove this condition is not a fair one; at least it is more of a constrained and anxious thought, as the bodies dissmisal of it holds more sway. Yet, we can helm ourselves with insight and fortuity, as to make our living condition better, and otherwise remove the impetus of where it is going: for we know how our momentary experiences of rest will forever compare. Better yet, as you relate such bits of time to those of finality, so can such moments of insight illimuate the wonders and awe of your actual living. Whereby, the struggle of living not only levels out -and affords comparison to death- but so does it become more worthwhile; so that your wish to die now as to remove the burden (however futile) is not so present, and instead, your wish to live is the imperative, and freely too, as the end by which it makes is not one to worry about. Nor should you feel like your mistaken, or arriving at that entrence unequiped. "That is only the concern for those who intend to continue living. While nothing asks for not."

        <div id="productofdeath">
            The strenght I have in believing the plainess of death, comes from our otherwise settlement of nature's register. Simply, the weather is not made on a whim, and we know this; nor is the belief otherwise a fair one. Now, there is this needed notion for the sake of our limit, or progress rather, whereby we assign that natural gate to the climate as constant, as opposed to altering and commanded. This, is not why the winds are not governed by Gods; only, in seeing how their effects come from certain causes, so can we say that its constance is apparent. This is in contrast to a concieved notion that all is constant, and thus weather being a thing applies. In a word, a priori is not our point here, but of experience. The term constance though is what were trying to append. But of things not experienced, that is hard too do. Yet, all we are tasked with doing is actually trying to give detailed assessments for what do in fact know, and at any rate can presume. For you see, death may not be something we can reflect on, so deeply that, but so are our assumptions and illusory definiitions equally false. And by point of removing weakness', our stable strenght can come from simlpy helming the proper terms.
            <br>&emsp;It seems a given that our mind is attributed to some holly sector of our regard, and in our idling ways, we assume that this covered end will in fact bend it (our mind) into some comfy existence.
            <br>&emsp;What we must removed though is in thinking that things which are certainly not of the mind, will in fact be present in that following state. This, in short, is to distinguihs the loopiness by which we lable our thoughts and sense, and that of vision, touch, smell and vitality. These, like the weather, have common and natural explanations, and are not some phenomena for us to ardently suppose. And the point, is that within our inquiry, we will not assume that a realm of unbodily existence will include the products born only of bodies. We may at this point hold onto the mental elements which are for all intensive purposes ambigious, but so would we be wrong in thinking that where our death takes us, would hold either an environemtn that was comparable to one inhabited by the sun, or that we could experience heat in the way that kinectics do to a body.
            <br>&emsp;Where I struggle is in thinking whether or not our thoughts are somehow exclusive to the worldly realm, and are but seperate things which inhabit our bodies and leave upon it's dispersal. Again, beyond rebirth, the notion of the afterlife, in this sense, is one which regards our continuation; as if the self of our body moves on when the latter is gone. And again, we are making the note that the abscence of those body faculties will yeild according abscences. There are many questions then as to where our mind goes, and what that experience is like. And at any rate as the history of thought has dealth us, so is our mind a subject like anyother, who is supposedly subject to judgement. That is, be it seperate from the body. or the whole thing going through, there is still this idenitiy which we are, as either mental facultites and or the mixings of body faculties, which both act as members for entry into that afterlife. This is a difficult thing to explore, for it in many ways holds two loosely defined truths: one being the case for judgement, and our otherwise place as one's being judged. For it may be true that we are sentenced to some sort of end following death, but so may it be one of a resonant comfort and warmth, as compared to a resonant pain and grief. This contrasts with the lively view of an afterlife, where instead of being resonant -like our dreamless sleep is- it is more like a play, where we are either prisoners in a red hot dungeon, or are guests of a white light resort. If there is judgement, it may direct us to either kind.
            <br>&emsp;What I believe otherwise, or what I mean to speak about, is the notion of parts, and how some are a given in how they are conducted and produce; and at any rate, if our mind is unknown in its entirety, so is the end in which it goes, still one where it is solely itself, and into a realm which amounts to all but what it particulalrly is. In that, if there is no kinectics, then their is no common effect of heat; nor would the abscence of matter confer any effective weight or physicality. In a word -while dismissing rebirth- our approach here is not one where the mind is an animaotor, of our body in this worldy case, that upon its seperation from it, goes on into another body, of another world, but one which is reminisscent of a dream, whereby the sun there is merely a figure, and that the bodies in mention are more like they are in our imagination, compared to those which are physical and current -whereby our death pulls our minds from. This is not what I suppose, or base my thinking on. When we die we are not entering a play. Rebirth is besides the point, as it too enters back into the real world, or at any rate goes into a realm with bodies of its own sort. But so far as the heat of fire impacts our skin, and our mind is but a witness to the body which it inahbits experiencing such pain, we are not of the view, or on the side of, that our time after death is of a ppsitivite or negative form of unphysical bodies, yet comparable to what they are in the real world. That is, there is no mental form of fire which our hellish sentence can subject us to, for our mind is not what fire can burn. This looks past the notion of introduced experiences, but only because are'nt consider neurology and kinectics as relatable to the minds nature. It is but an agent which animates bodies that are subject to such thing. And our only point, is that the nature of death which we are given or judged by, is not one that holds the effects of bodies, without the properties and constuct of those bodies being there. Or at any rate, we don't believe that we will be part of a dream. For even that seems to be absent when our actual body is truly at rest; and our abscence from it is in fact a total purity of that sort. "Whereby our living state seceds out of its bodily dreams, and into a state of ease and rest; as if our body is becoming in its own right absent (as comapred to haste) and, in effect, dips its toes in the pools of nothing. The point being that when our literal toes are gone, that we are seeped in the blood of that pool." And my stance, or lens at least I look through, holds us either as fish, or not, within an empty sea. Or, better said, our death does not bring us to eternal realm of Atlantis, but rather a place which does not invite or permitt the impression of light, heat, fear and breathe.
            <br>&emsp;That is my sense of death, in its product at least. And fairly, the notion of judgement, as if the abyssal pool we were in was one of tar as opposed to dark crystal, is not one with any real substance. Even the protestants felt that heaven or hell was there for all: and thats saying quite a bit when their playfull view of the end is still governeed by sensible rights. Nor, I must admitt, is there much sense in beleiving that this dismissal of bodies would have a variation of such abscnence. You might say that somethings are more abscent than others, but at this point the definition is off. At least, I cannot speak to what is there, besides pure nothing that is, that is not from and to the world at hand. And as it is gone, so am I unclear how it is only partially so. Though, I feel like its remnants are not what were discussing, but rather a varied mixture of nothing -following that dissmissal. Yet in that I don't see how nothing is not common, pervasive and entire. Nor would it have bounds and configuration similar to matter. 
            <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, I make my claim that the elements of nature go only where she goes; and less we are reborn into her, and assuming that our stance on an aferlife is one where there is an unatural element -which we call soul or mind- which carries on, so is it my fair that such succession is not into a place which holds its own existence. At least, so much as we are gone from the place which hled the body were were alive in, so are the effects of those properties not present in a place which is bare of such suiters. And in a word, total is what I see when we are gone, for there is no clear persistence that our mind latches onto; nor is it present within anything but itself, and the effects which our embodiement held, holds no more. Even if there were forces and objects for pleasure and pain, where doth my tongue and groin, or by liable heart and hands?
            <br>&emsp;And perhaps, in summary, my depiction is one which merely claims that when we are no where, so is there not, of which we are included. By which would could cement our place now, as one which is equal to the objects which our end seperates us from. Which is to say that I, am no different than my hand, only the voice and intention which marks his portrayal, as one who is but the same as what he sees; whereby the end of him counts both the body and 'we': and truly begins the reign of not.

            I would describe my life along two lines; but really, all is one, and as rough as it becomes, so do we take additional angles; as if we are trying to mend those knotted strands. 
            <br>&emsp;In that, I see that their is a pervasive condition, and one which breathes its success when their is an evident rest. For it is sound in that our ignornace of the continuation of tasks, would not yeild us any rest if we acted as though this weren't true; which at any rate helms itself under the notion that less we clearly removed from such ends, so would our awareness of such only procurr peace if we were congeninal to what we truly expected. 
            <br>&emsp;By that we are in fact sound, at least we have our inner merrits to level out any mishaps and ruts in the mainline. Yet, the world was not always this way, and our complexity of that line does not hold up to its low density. In that, we have attoned to much against its shortcomings, that all but its core thread are solid. Though, our time of remission has dealt us an unwinding effect, whereby unneccessary braces were loosened, and our core line was given rooom to breathe. In that, I see that so long as that thread is sure, are we well. And one way of judging that is if we are really fine being ourselves; whereby we'd be otherwise, if in our abscnece from people and things, we needed further aims or pleasure to make us content. Our past actions and expected ones should be enough to settle us now. 
            <br>&emsp;Weirdly though, there is this trekking flair to our stability, whereby the wave of live, albeit amended too, is one that continues. And in that, occupation holds our regard; for even though we have real harmony, it is moreso for stability and rest; which itself, can feel idling; at least as we have accompanied ourself to these ways, and our previoulsy pre-occupided self struggles to be merely so. I only mean then, that although their are prevailing forces from our prior time, so is their something to be said about making use of your time; at least, measuring and amending on the basis of what comes to you, and draws your aim, from the steadiness of these grounds. While before our ends were born out of a knotted core; and our place was one which tried to grow higher as to make our life even. Yet this was poor, and had not natural gait, or flow that is; but so in this current state when our nature is more suitably content, so are we unoccupied. Or better said, we can see positiviely that occupation is viable. At least, things in and of themselves; as if we truly were free. 
            <br>&emsp;I see the bulk of work that we have. And my wish is to find more meaning in it, as to reflect the words at hand. This covers our overall view of history and its general cover of life (civilly that is); the plainess of death and uncommon hue of gratuity; the insensibility of inconstance and non-totality; the portrait of sums, and its final reasoning; and, our colorfull resolve and core amends, which in other words remark our rest and liberty: which itself sprouts a mark for means and ends. I can only speak briefly as to what this means specifically, but in terms of what I want to do, I wish to learn how to write emails and (cover and or submission) letters, and bend our will towards publishers, of either a whole form or that of essay. Perhaps this campaign will include message boards, easier submissions and all things alike; and at any rate, our completed form is prime for family and friends to see -as a point of energy at least. Additionally, our fragments has a similar view, though its base is placed in the realm of content. This respects my large interest in the topics at hand, and allows me to be precice and prolific. I'd say this is relevant to our writing, but such a stretch has others before it; nor do I see much need to concern the benefits of such (then) exposure when the means to sharing are approachable now. If we try at least we can further manage and arrange what we have, as to find spots where it is accessible. Right now though, I know clearly what I have, and am not privy to any discretion which would see it excluded. "To all bends we can try."
            <br>&emsp;I'll try to go over our leisure more briefly. Watching series seems a garnish, for they are generally rich in detail and quality, and otherwise dense and short. Yet, in that, there are many, and through the spots of our week theres room for one then the other. House and Lost are no love of mine; but are at any rate pleasant past times. And although There Will Be Blood is important, so is it a series of its own, but unique of the sort. Film comes and goes, and shows need a break; while series are like books, which start elegantly as they end, and move on to the next with ease. True Detective is ripe, as Scenes has been. Maturity, from violence especially, can mark something as such, in that Peaky Blinders or Narcos may be long, or Thrones even, but so are they of similar natures to series, that it is fine to oblige. Otherwise, the show with Laurie and Hiddleston, Chernobyl, Mare of Eastown, things of life, plain, common, no matter the thrill and grime; not all will be absent of lust as There Will Be Blood; and HBO, Prime, Netflix even, theres plenty. And like a book, you just pick it up.
            <br>&emsp;I've got two things, but I'll mention Diablo first. This game is like Ark, BF and Civ, in that you return to it; merriting thus an understanding, as you are in fact playing a game: the progression of which should be known. It would help for old and new characters, if you knew what strongholds and dungeons should be completed; and otherwise which glyphs were worthwhile, their stretch of experience required, and what points of development offered what -such as Duriel around tier 70. Just outlining the minor bit between 55 and 60, where the endgame can than be approached, would make the slower pace of that acceptable. "And the stale parts, or stretches of growth required, through the 30s and 60s, fairs similarly."
            <br>&emsp;Secondly, and most dear when it comes to our point of occupation, is grabbing the civil lens of the world with integrity. It is so easy to watch the news and have your complexion of the world change; or watch a drama, or serious show at that, and find your colors dripping with red. I would say that most of this comes from concentrated impressions, which saturate a rather small pallete, with faint colors itself. Our extent of knowledge is not the problem, albeit unfilled in some areas. But rather our prominence. For even with our mere notion of populous government and the liberty it provides, that frame holds little prominence. Now, each part of the frame has its own mean, but so is there folds of tissue which fill in the majority of space in between. You can add more ideas as to make the complex more secure, but adding that volume will make things stand on its own; and otherwise make the structure there ballon and thrive. In that, foremost, is the account of the world. For general sense is what I seek regarding all of civility. Yet, in exactedness, to statitisce and numbers I trust. This means the population for one, then the incidences of crime, accidents, GDP and illness. And, to be fair, not much more is required. Perhaps different forms of systems, as in the bureaus of New York or the shires of England; all while each is a different flavor of neighbourhooods -which itself is a general notion, amongst others. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the key countries are in need of figures. That is, Canada, US, Britain, Germany, France (and maybe Spain and Italy too), Australia, China, Russia, India, and perhaps the larger souther countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria and South Africa. At the very least then, you can do overviews of the secondary continents - ie. Africa, South America and the Middle East. And at any rate, the history of these localles is worthwhile too know; for the population of modern Britain (and London at that) is better served by its progress through the centuries prior.

        <div id="openended">
            I feel like when were talking about nature and death, we have to consider the alternative sides as if they were right. If we knew ours, or the natural one rather, was in fact so then our regard could be absent. But as it were, we know no truth of any sorts, and thus all ends have some merrit. At least we shouldn't speak about them as if their wrong, as we know not how in any explicit sense. Even if their proposal is full of contrariety and baseness, so ought we merely describe it as such, or at leas explain what those weakness' are. But the race is not over.
            <br>&emsp;Theres this notion of our main line, and how it in many ways gets crowded by the woes of other people and our own neglect; whereby passion and contrivance seek to bring us past this; yet in that Socratic sense, 'your soul catches up'. In that way, we are best to look at ourselves deeply; which is why we have such a interest in death. For totality is hard to regard, in whether it is consistent and whole. And at any rate, our stable time is one which appropriately wanders; as if it is not running around and ordained to things which are either false or contrary to that main line; whereby we are in fact settled and kept to that primary source, yet, in our progress towards this at least, we may have nothing else which naturally sprouts from this. In a way, our line of reproach has brought solid products with us back to this nearest ways. Which is to say, that we were in fact unsettled in who we were and thus pressing to some outward end; which admittedly held much constance over the years and accompanying merrit: yet that road never came to head, as we were routinely burnt out and with nowhere inwards to go. Now, as we have relinquished the falsity in what those outward ventures were for, we have more ease and accumulation to that deepest lane. And again, instead of hankering down as to find passion or relief, we are in fact personally stable; and from our excellent pace, we have brought back the goods from that, but to this nestled levels, whereby they more breezily float and drift.
            <br>&emsp;This idea of occupation then, is one where we have not but free time. Before, our aims were one that marked what we truly wanted, yet it was somewhat taken away and in some sense molded, for the sake and form of what would bring us out of our untendeed ways. Now, such eveness and strenght can hold itself from within; and as such, our interest which remain, or at least of faculty, have more room and reason to proceed and aspire for things in and of themselves. It wasn't the case that we were often drawn to things which strcitly fortold our relief; but so did those ultimate ways eventually lead such ends to become banked on so. Whereas now, the color of things has no pre-occupation, or motivation which is banked on something which comes from acquired strain. And in that, our occupation is one of election, purpose, meaning, substance, color and kind. Yet, being so forward about it has me thinking that our core solidity, is in fact of the bark, but not of any given plummage of fruits itself. We lack the money for occasions and thrill, nor is our character and time so far disposed and or familiar with friends and intiamcy. What we have is community, and the warmth and structure that offers. But at any rate, we are only able to easily be ourselves; as such harmony affords us to act without any strain. In that, where we are drawn is of a positivte sort, as our sparkle and delight is amended to by the graces of somethings complexion, as opposed to its reward. Yet, there is still less which I see when we are in fact idle. And that is so because our only gain, in repreiving to ourselves, is in being so worn out personally; yet not much else is there which settles our gaze, or clarifies it at least. Theres room for that admittedly, and some obvious spots for our attention. But just as our prior time was poorly measured on the basis of its truly struggling ways, so are we in this tenderly oriented state still uncontent without either the clarity or bend to something forward. This, to be clear, is not so that our position or heart can find a better station: as our actions right now have already garnered that. But in that even, there is a slowness, which, to positively, opens us to contriving something to do; at least to an end which is elected and drawn out, but liberally as opposed to passion. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the time of our communal self still needs more room and reason to find itself without much need to act. Whereby, we find occupation in this better self; which nicely compares to those weary occupations in our tired self. Yet activity is still what we seek; less overall, but still with many moment where the lack is still felt, albeit less pressing and tearing as to make me conrtive some amends (as our youth held) or move with haste (as our adolescnece has been). I guess my adult life is to small to ahve acquired anyhting which would make me happy; and in that I still wish to do; but still, we are adults, and a such can scult and mold interests and objectives that reflect the positive roots of me and nature. "And to that, I am with cheer in our end."
        </div>
        <div id="nowandcoming">
            It seems our amends are bent on two points: one being present, the other of ends. The first, regards intervention, which is to say that nature can be suspended, or interupted rather; and that as it were, in a cultural sense, our hopes and wishes (punishments to) can be delivered besides the normal course of things. This, to me, reeks of inconstance, and is thus full of contrariety. The simple figure to consider is a sphere, and how adding any point, be it on the edge or in the middle, would retain the uniformity of what it is. Now, if a sphere is in fact the mark of such uniformity, then a small bramble stikcing out would just account for the object being as so. "Of a specific form lets say." But, in the course of things, where motion from causes and for effects are concerned, so does that mena that the strands, which upon movement, nudge everything else, means that if one is introduced, so will everything be treated. "As I budge A a little, so does B move, which then moves C; and the point is that Z can't go without its own effect when the points its beckoned to are impacted themselves." 
            <br>&emsp;Now, so much is known about what the initial cause led too, that our lack of definition (and identity) there, means that that such cause is hard to describe. At least, we cannot say with natural explicity what it is or means. But, what we do know, or at least the fairest position to have, is that nature is not a inifinte mixture of indiviudal points, acting on their own accord -from whichever initial source. Instead, it seems that what caused one thing gave rise to the other, and like fabric twisting in the wind, there is but varied configurations: but all of the same whole. This means that there are not many domains, of which the intervention of one (and the accoording effects of all members in that) is not so exclusively. At least, we can say that from the light we see from the billions of galaxies around, so are we on the same level. "or spun from the same cloth that is." And again, all were trying to say is that a wick of fibre here accounts for the wicks of fibres elsewhere. Beyond the first cause, so has everything come up together, whereby all its motions were in fact respective to everything else around. This is why it is consistent. And there may in fact be many universe, or domains at least. But so far as were concerned, regarding ours, or at least 'a' universe, so is it all connected, in its beginnings and ends. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, theres very little evidence for the domain being impacted amidst its initial ways. At least, where one end went this way, tugging on others, and others did the same, so is the source of this the only real point of concern; but all flicks and bends that came from that, have all done so in unison. And as such, there is no evidence that intervention has ever occured. In fact, if we take this point of constance to be true, then we'd realize that as so much time of it has gone by, that the according stability could not invite even a sliver of instability, without the system going astray. "The smallest kink would spoil the immense intracy."
            <br>&emsp;Those are some thoughts about intervention; which indeed hamper anyone's interest or sight about benefits, and fears admittedly, in our active lives. At any rate though, I believe the chicken came first here. For death has always been the utmost concern, and by that, I feel as though nature's control over that has held our furthest regard. From there, I think the portrait of how such ends were dealt, progressed into ways in which our life could be altered too. In short, the latter marks that point of intervention, while the former measures judgement. It is worth mentioning that all could in fact be designed, and that what is good or bad may be set with you in mind. That is not the problem of intervention. The question of design, which is a deistic concept, is its own problem. What were talking about is the contrariety of nature, whereby introductions of things could occur without breaking the otherwise constance of things. And as it were, such constance in most ways forbids such intrusion. In other words, what was set, be it of mind and intent or some other wordly cause, is already in motion and staked: none of it can be changed. Wisdom would seem to be what drives the right amendment to such course; nor would our sentiment of faith be poor if it were angled on the appreciative side of things, regarding our place in such a merry stream. It is only when we get willfull ourselves, and earnest, and think that something new can be given; at least we fear for and wish otherwise, for ends which are in fact favorable; but with the ignorance that all things are set: or better yet, we mistake nature's constance for something which can be suspended. "Doth wisdom give us the claim of amending to what is, while the foolish sides of religion and theology have us wishing for such currents to change."
            <br>&emsp;Judgement is comparable in its folly, but perhaps even less so; at least, as I see it, the beliefs here are taken for granted regarding something truly baseless, that I see no trickery or silliness at play. Theres no real alternative, and as it were, this idea remarks the edges of what our natural view even knows. I deem prayer for change to be of more folly, as it stakes itself on things with more evidence to the contrary. Whereas death itself is less understood, that be of Cerebes and Styx, or the gates of heaven, I cannot say. In other words, the woes of ignorance are more active and unbecoming of someone, while the view of judgement is merely an alterntive -however weak- of an end, who even the ones with the strongest view don't know. "Which is to say that I don't scorn the complacency of a universal mystery." Still, I am not sure why judgement affords any credit. For it too compares to intervention, in that each are placed on supposed truths; generally regarding some divine govenor. And we know that at the very most, he set things in motion initially (and nothing more); and so why would our death be different. I think the issue is that we are assuming way too much what death is, and how it literally varies from hell to heaven; and that these are ideas that mark some notion of a dream; or at least an experience which has suitably positive or negative elements which reflect those of the real world, but lack the material itself. This is a casserole of inquiry if you ask me, and in most ways beckons under any wieght of due regard. To be clear, we nearly ardently believe that intervention is false, as it just sprouts to much contrariety; while death itself, albeit unknown, seems to hold an equal amount of discredit when it comes to comparably tradiotioanl ends. Only, in its case, the credit is not so clear elsewhere. Whereas the definition of nature is one which heavily leans towards constance, while our definitions of death some either mystical or absent. My point though, is that coming up with definitions seems fair, and disregarding the baseless elements of what is otherwise present seems fair.
            <br>&emsp;I think, in general, that our deaths are more comparable to a dreamless sleep; in that our body not being present removes any of the restless incorporations of our living experience. Whether the mind is seperate or of the body, it seems that there would truly be nothing, or something mental which was privy to nothing. "At least, our mind would be a witness to all things non-material. Which as a point of foolish remissions, reasons that the elements of the world would not be present, but in a figurative form." This is merely the description of death though, in terms of what it actually is. The notion of judgement is one where the end varies. Which itself is tricky, because that suggests there is seperate sorts of ends. 
            <br>&emsp;I think the problem is that what we experience as 'mind', has a progressivley smaller hold in terms of what is mind, and the body. If our heart flutters, that is nerves, and if we see, that is vision, nor is our speech, as a product that is, one of anything more than tissue and acoustics. The mind is internal. But even then, if our body is sick, then so do our thoughts feel similar, and our emtions at that. This raises the question though as to what is being effected; for the point to consider is whether the mind is of the body or not. Rather than being a product of organs and matter, which would then explain how our words and thinking are course and muddle when the instruments are mucked up, it still wouldn't make sense how the mind was tarnished itself if the body was all that was ill. The point is that the mind is inside the body, a witness. And how it experiences comfort and pain is one thing; but so is it not the victim in question. At least, how it suffers is not clearly understood; as the mind, being words and ideas, is not in this sense the scaffolding product from our bodies pedastool, but is instead something seperate, an agent of ether, who witness what the body goes through; to which our wish for death is banked on such seperation. 
            <br>&emsp;My point though, is that if the mind is seperate from the body, and we are not dilluded into confounding this notion -as it blurry vision being confused for something non material- then we are left with the bare identity of mind in general, and thus what constitutes its place in death. All I am wondering then, is besides the active expereince of the mind amidst the body, is how it could vary without the body. For in that, there would be no effects of a bodily sort; and what is  left over is not well defined. At any rate, it is unclear how the mind would not be simply left over, to itself, normal, univesal, divinely integrated. In that though, if there is something which is more than nothing, but not of material, it is odd to think that this would be varied, and not something, when compared to material, of a general sort. I lack of the minds active definition may be giving me too much an assumption, in that I am not clear how besides the body their is any expereince at all; or at least how besides the expereince of that body, that the mind has positive and negitive ends. That is the fair definition of heaven and hell, in that mental turmoil or glee would be your eternity; and as such, judgement would be fair to conlcude, on the basis that for some reason or the other, a side was selected. At this point though, I would say that we are left with a puzzle and no pieces. At least, the pieces that are there are based on the assumptions we have and poorly defined parts. In contrast, if the mind is in fact of the body, and ends with death, or at least holds no distinct sway once that seperation is done, and judgement is of no concern (or without prescence), then so would that seem preferable, in that all one was subject too was the endless void of nothingness: at least what was normal of entirety when material was absent. In that, I personally see peace, grace and tranquility. And while everyone else fiddles and jigs around foreign clues and schemes, I will simply procced with rest, liberally, gratefully, unchanged. "For in that blip of time, where all converged into a twisting itinery, of which mass, stars, planets and mind sprouted: so are the ends of that no puzzle to me."

        <div id="pathofmen">
            It seems that the world has come together; over time from wandering till the advent of men. Yet, in that, as groups formed from different points, so did the borders begin to push against all others. Much has been learned from this, in terms of civility, custom, laws, commerce: but nothing more pains the annals of people, then war. For in that communion, whereby our neighbours were of a different sort, so did we feel the need to prepare, secure, defend; which in its own right sprouted offenses. Yet, in that, I see much more than the simple tyrant, who took hold of what was otherwise a internal brace. Instead, I see the aims of man driving him to head. Broadly speaking, his lessons of yore and biblical sentiments, bend his claims towards that offensive. So that even if things were secure, which is fair as is governemtn acceptable for structuring things, so was religions affect one which drove people to aggression. At least, theres this antagonist response, as if the people beside us were somehow our opponents; which, they are in the grand scheme of things, as even a local competiont between two coblers is there. But in this case, it is as if the values we had of some divine purpose, rubbed up against the equally divine angle of those others. And my suscpicion, is that our warring natures is merely one that sees another as a threat; and rather than merely defend, we see too much risk in having them by our side. In this, I see religion as a limiting factor for our communion, as diplomacy and approval could not be fully had. Not only were the sentiments confrontational, but so was any real aggreement or amends hard to make, when the purpose of each party was so different. In fact, as Christianity spread throughout the medieval realm, the conflicts lost their grand scale. This holds thin truths mind you, yet my ignorance is about the relgion each member had. All I am thinking, for instance, is that if the Barbarians were undoubtedly christian, like the Romans, then I think that converse could more postiviely occur. I must admitt the details of this are sparese. The point though, is that as man has come together, forming nations, animated by God, so has the shifting of this (in each parts color and proclivity) settled us in our current place. For our governments are not subject to such foolish tyranny, nor are our actual problems ones which cant be fixed within our own borders. We're all similar you see, and the flattening of difference that religion professed, seems to have given us permission to deal with ourselve. Whihc, in aim, has us settling on the  effective qualities of our nation, and thus success of our people. At least, without the inflammatory truth of the divine sparking us to act in unfounded ways, we can at least be brazen in our givens; which is to say that the elements of poverty, illness, economy and education are acceptable by all naturally driven parties; and the organization of those, be it to a small group or massive one, is not subject to anything but the properties of the governenaces form. And my thesis, is that religion thwarted this natural understanding, and instead maligned our ingenuity and capacities towards conquest and tyranny. "As the unnatural roots of our commonality and souls, colored our solutions accordingly."
            <br>&emsp;So I may breathe some conclusion onto the page, I'd remark that beyond any notion of coming problems, the current state of most nations and their converse, is positive. In fact, when you consider the rate of poverty and acute illness' decrease, we can see that our place is a good one. And, against that fact of expecating future depravity, we can attest to the consistent rate improvement; and otherwise cite the reasons for such movements; which gives us the only task, of confirming whether the prescence of those means are solid and proceeding, or if their whithering away. By all common accounts, our compusre is more reminsicent of the former; and at any rate seems to be impropving. "For life in 1996 was better than 1913: but compare the quality of our lives then to our modern times in 2024" if I had compartively nothing, there'd still be the givens of technology in my hand, and all its leisure and benefits. Nor would the constants of liberality and services wain."
            <br>&emsp;But, strangely, I don't think the sight of the world remarks such quality, or the improvemnt from millenai prior. Likely, this is due to the media and tradition jumbling us up: but that is besides the point: regarding everyone else that is. For, be it the truth, I plainly see this; yet of others view otherwise, that I only note. Our own time and place then seems a mystery; for we are not at all subject to the open freedoms of such fine ways. Instead, as it were, we protect ourselves, in that the goods that come from these good times, are not commonly shared; nor are they so admired, or accepted even. In plain, we value things, feel ease or concern and at any rate angle our course, under the context of this world we see. And, developmentally, as I'd reflect, our greatest merrit and taste, is in the reservation to expereince what is commonlay good, for what is in fact truly normal. For as I remember, we have been hesitant to amend and be pleased with the norms of the common world. I always found it juvenile, promiscuous, faltering and or innacurate; and ny place then was to amend otherwise: or be obsinent. But, you see, that is our tale, our faith, or legend of man. For that detail is crucial, in that besides this veil of common ends, we were subject to it and all other things. This cross road marks our approach to freedom, in that as we matured we grew the trunk and bounds of a more becoming course -of the good world we see. Only, that commission and its appraoch, held its own ends of which our deliberate amends towards it, left us awkawrdly holding its riches. And that is both what I must change, and commend.

            The thing to understand, is that your view of things is fair. Only, the need of anything, however sound, is not equal to the actions it actually takes. For, stealing is in some way more comendable than indolence. Even though the act is a vice, so is it forward, and at the very least privy to rehabilitation and recompense. At any rate, those who live in virtue, have something to contrast themsvelves with; some adjacent shade that affirms their path, or strenghtens its place as the contrary beckons. But idleness seems a spares for all. At least, it seems to be born of an abscence of things; while vice is more of misguidance. "But at least their is effort, trying."
            <br>&emsp;I say this, because our efforts have not always been quite prominent, of bad or good. Instead, in our youth, we flattened out; whereby we set outsevles with very little intent to the common good; but were not elsewhere set.
            <br>&emsp;Now, the caviot is that the reason for our dismissal of norms, was sincere and galliant. But, the truth which we were more privy to, was not so much besides  the negation of norms; and thus, there was no alternative push for an end besides those norms: and we were thus idle.
            <br>&emsp;In this the path to real freedom was made; as per our virtue, we gave little to what those norms required; nor, beyond any neccessary aspect (of those norms) which we conceded to, did we loose our sight and mind for the primary truth. And so as responsability levelled our ways, so were we keen to use it for righthoues ways. At any rate, what was really demanded of me, as part of the norm, only extended to a certain point; and all steps past that were subject to the excess: where we were free.
            <br>&emsp;That is perhaps the reflected vector, whereby we denied the reign of duty that our youth was subject too. "Her threats were unsubstantial; at least, what she promised us if we met her hand, was not something that merrited risk of ignorance." Her ends admittedly held aspects of what is otherwise true, but so were these but general pits of a tree which those norms did not reflect.
            <br>&emsp;You see, the world is small, but round. In that, we are all together, but spread out. And in that, we prioritize the means to making our time and pleasantrie more favorable. Yet, in that, there is little to be said about what is either at risk upon our avoidance, worthwhile from further amends, nor any sentiment of liberal use; at least, if we were stable, what standard would deem us as so, and for what opened end. What is commonly provided, seems to bake itself in the excess of needs, fear of populations and governmence; and otherwise, holds no interest or integral strenght to be drawn or composed enough to liberty. Which, in our clear fairness, comes from the gluttnous complacency born of drawn out ends -for far neccesities- and the unexposure and repose to sound sources which rightyl portray the world; along with the whimsival saturation from tired and punget sources -ie. the news, drama, feeds.

        <div id="echoedflame">
            I guess my point, beyond what I can mold and define, is one of character and description. Simply, we are a man, but only because we are more privy too the truth. Yet, in this reflection, we can say that the part of history were subject too, is one where the embellishments of a negative world, are in fact unfounded; and at any rate obvious to  those with welcomed hearts: who shun and ignore those unneccessary demands. Which is to say that their are not enough problems for me to be as my heart knows, to sacrifice or repent over the amends to any apparent negativity. 
            <br>&emsp;The point, is that this is but a early sprout, or new one at least, that has come out of a millenia of fighting. As it were, the world settled following the dissmisal of Rome; and although their sat societies far in the east, the West grew with intracy. Yet, in that, its strenghts imploded the continent, as reason and faith collided, to be a hallmarked degree, but internall as well -whereby religious wars were done by those faithfull, but of different angles. In that, it seems that Europe has been the source of its own conflict. For reason and science has yeilded paramount harvests, in both pleasure and civility. Yet, the woes of conflict still ensue. Admittedly, the great turmoils were of a internal sort, with fragmented battles speckeld around. But so in the recent end of our age, did despotic rule take hold, leading to massive aggressions and repose. Why these were what they are is unclear; though Christianity and its contrast to natural ends -which would then be all agreed on- seems a partial culprit. For I don't know why Germany, Britain and France aren't clammering for eachothers throats; nor Italy, the Balkans or Spain. They all seem to be in harmony: and I am not sure why. It seems that the great wars were a turning point; but again, what evening force has brought them into harmony. For one, it seems the world has become more global in general, be it in laws, custom or trade. Telecomunnications seems the biggest factor then; only, the effect of this is whats essential. As I see it, the truth, or at least the strength of reasoning and evidence, is less liable to elitest hoarding; whereby everyone can know who is fibbing or not, and otherwise has more means to share such scrutiny. In practice, those in charge have no room for disguises, nor delusion: as information is so present along with the means for enacting unrest. This is a good thing though, as compliency of the government is good when its notice is bent on whether it truly performs well. It seems in our developed days, that the public is more incensed due to this form of accountability; but so are those educated able to see if problems are actually present (and their magnitudes). Its a strange thing admittedly, that the world could be fine, and refelct accordingly of those in charge; yet, the realm of discourse holds less relevant strands as paramount. Which, for those keen on knoweldge and such amends, really must content with the impressions and liabiity of stains, from the social bickering. It is hardly violent though. And with due respect to public scenarios where such ends were in fact so, we can suspend our own worries under the notion that, in contrast, our scenario is in fact successfull and pleasant: while those invovled in violent revolts generally had a reason. 
            <br>&emsp;"Who could pretend that those in despotic portions of the world weren't brave and cheered for in their opposition to such depsots; while what, we in Canada and the Western world are concerend with the effieciney's of our riches? What disregard is their for people worse off in general; but, compared to those truly severe incidences, does our call to action expose our ignroance in glaring ways: as if we are actually devoted to our personal cause: but of what suffering?"
            <br>&emsp;I think, as the story goes, that the world has been in general if not explicit conflict; and that this is generally due to the settling of major powers. And, at any rate, how the customs and resolve of religion, or the core values and culture that it reflects, satuturates and bends said nations. "For even if nature gave reason to judge our lands as green, so could our divine messages tell us that the grass was red, and that others were in fact too blame." This, running from bakers to kings, seems to paint what is both acceptable and sought by those who rule, and their subjects -who generally pressure the former when their needs and beliefs are not supported or secured. Nevertheless, past the wars which brought this turmoil and character to an end, we are clearly in a time where such norms and aims are uncommon. And in fact, the unfortuned parts of the world are rising closer to those who truly are; and they, with those at the bottom coming closer, are experiecing a reign of liberty, leisure, indsutry, service, peace, growth and natural fecundity, that even the older days of this are not short of their plehtora of riches. Yet, as pong has become Minecraft, so has our qualitiy of living equally improved. Across the board the elements may vary, and those who used to live in the mud may only be privy to Pac-man, so are we here in the average peaks of the world beneficiaries of Google, Wikipiedai, Youtube, the bounty of educational and work oppertunities from the internet, its bevy of accesible movies, games and shows, the evening of transit and cell phones, or any commerical product and service that is availabe at competative prices, and quick to your door. This is our world, and it is a mixture of what is now digital, and otherwise our use of this in the already free aspect of the world. As if we are now fortuned enough to use tools in our liberal ways, so has that given aspect of our citizenry found broader ends; as before, our freedoms were used to acquire what we needed, yet such means were themselves more arduous then any must experience now; nor, have those means been anything short of mitigated, as what we seek is more effieicntly bought and experieinced. "At least, the highest quyality of life is found primarily through devices, which come so cheap and cleanly, that the limit is only how much character and charm you have to use them. Maing the risk one of boredom, rather than stability."

            Theres just so much to say. The symptoms of our waivering heart, the absent mystery which suitably yeilds us rest, and the otherwise confusion about the nature of our amends, but how they came to be from nought, but to a world unknown. There's all these inneuendo's you see, as if those who are alive are doing so in ways that I can't see otherwise; as if old memories and infatuatoins are more reminiscent of truth, then not. This is so, for all we can do is deny, which itself causes stress; for the things in question are not clearly untrue. Rather, were rooted in something alternative, which admittedly sees those subjects as contrasts of truth; but so is our lack of touch to such way the impetus for us needing to address so. Whereby our grace with it, would see us with rest to all things contrary; and at the very least, disposed to be unprivy to such impressions.
            <br>&emsp;I guess our reflection is one that measures the worth of things, and how we in fact realized so amidst our youth and built up to it, rather than the common way. Yet, our deliberation feels more neccessary when our gait is slowed, be it to this truth or one other. And weirdly, our reflections tend to remove any fear of conseqeunce, as if our lack of action is a risky one. Instead, I seek more station within the right life, whereby our better moments secure us a clearer and secured approach. My reflection then comes, because our life has not treated us to such way; and in practice, it seems that our need for deliberation is a mark of having not made the right choices, or full ones at least. 
            <br>&emsp;Weirdly, our effortless graze is not one where everyone is removed and we are without sense or worry; instead, we feel more curious, as if the spacious sides of us are prime for development. Yet, time only affords us so much, as are the realities of this progress limiting. By that, we eventually reach a point where our effort is done, and besides wearing ourselves thin or binging as to cope with our state, with that were stuck with. 
            <br>&emsp;In that way, I have noticed that being with our current end, is one where we remain with the imperfections of it, and upon returing to an active pace we refine. This is why writing always happens on the front side of our return, or at least the beginning of the upside; as we are not so occupied with the effort to come, but we are also free and limber from our recuperation. Hereby, we are with not, in that our focus is unset; but we are well and able. Thus, the space around, or holes even, speak to me as they did before when we were recoverying; only now having done so, we address that.

        <div id="measuresnbits">
            It seems that there are general truths, such as the organization which government provides and its subjects submitt themsleves for. Or, in particular cases of terms, civility may mean domestic affairs such as manners or knoweldge of the law, or in that, of knowledge or sense, of the basic idea of commerce, services and trades. 
            <br>&emsp;On the other hand lies facts, or things rather. Which is to say, that schemes and ideas are the atmosphere, while the actual trees on the gruond remark members of the registery. For instance, there is the general notion of monarchs compared to representavies, compared to the specific (and or factual) account of an actual government, say the federation of Nigerai, and its members. In a word, actual refers to things, items, elements or aspects of fact, which is to say evident and present to the world; while general is more akin to values, aims, truths, sentiments and ideas, which are likely born from actual things, but are not explicit things themselves. The notion of discourse follows, in that it too deals with real things, but uses ideas and figures as to form concepts and depictions which help us understand and explore those things: but they are not the things themslves. In a literal sense, subjects are those which we refer to as we practically epxerience them; meaing that if we were in the matrix, but saw red and blue, so would the truth of their constructs be irrelevant within the domain of subjects; while the fact of the matter, or real truth, would be as they are as entitites. Which, for instance, is explained nicely by the computing done to portray an image on the screen, yet the entitiy in question is not equal to the subject you see. 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, general truths remark our understanding, and besides the complexions of things as they reflect said truths, the elements whihc are general or more akin to subjects, and figures at that. While, the actual infant-mortality rate of Lagos is less a subject, but real in comparison to the general idea of infant-mortality. And, with respect to writing, one tends to think of the world along the lines of living and civility; with the strands of liberty, leisure and craft marking the former and commerce, governance and law marking the latter. Yet, for each, I am painting a general truth, in that I may say, that the world has improved significantly in a civil sense, as our rights and custom are much fairer and oppertune than they were a millenia ago. This is a general depction, as my reflection is but a figure on the wall. And, case in point, if I gave an example, or instance which reflected said truth, that would in fact be a mark of something specific, actual and true. "Which nicely shows the difference."

        <div id="ofviewsandthings">
            It is perhaps the least welcomed but fairest claim to make, that reason is but the impression one gets of the world, and according means by which you amend. In that, all one can do is attest to what they see. In that even, there is the experience of others which is passed on; but be it of some tale or some evident complexion, so can we treat. "And, to be clear, reason is what takes these impressions and forms something whole: giving us a complete insight as to what something is, our need to respond and how." Reason paints the route in that sense.
            <br>&emsp;But for me, I cannot quite vouche for what I see. Contrariety is prominent when it comes to anecdotes and teaching; nor are systems and conjurings of artifical reasoning quite simple or comparable to the common expereince which we are best to address. Yet, in that basic realm, there seems to be not. In fact, theres not much but the world; and self regard is what orients me as to seek little from others -besides converse- nor is there much that one could take from me -besides arrogance (which is hard to dispute). There's not much for me, you see. And I hold little stock in narratives; as they paint the parties of the world as if they were sole entitties, but even if you did indeed split the government from the commonwealth, that even would hold its own intracicies, groupings and bends. We cannot speak to Germany or France but in a general sense; and we are only right to do so in an equally general way. Which is to say, that if we compound what were talking about, as in the batch of our sociteal lives into the notion of 'civility' or matters of that sort- so must we apply that notion within a general matters as well. For instance, it seems wrong to say that the Supreme Court ruled on this filing; as even it, as a specificed filing, is not so clear and precise. If you were in fact detailed, and gave the name of whose convicted, then the name of the judge would at least seem fitting. Again, I am not saying to not speak of the Supreme Court, as a general group. But the elements of it need more precision if the matter which it is being discussed within, is specific. I think, perhaps, my point is that we take concerns for particualr things, such as a war or conflict, but attiribute the members in question in general ways. Germany and France don't go to war, as neither are really but a lable for batch of other specific things. Poor on me to say, that this sentiment rests on the detailed concern of war, but then plotting the participants in a general sort. That is the issue; which itself, seems to raise little worries, or fair concerns, when the issue itself is quite general. General things then, seem best for overlaying ideas; which themselves hold not much more but depciting the scene of things, as opposed to speaking of them. It is the advantage of one talking personally though, as that general scene can extract particular elements, then apply them as is relevant to the one writing. Whereas, if you wish to convey concerns for the war between Britain and Spain, then you must specify the subject of war and its combatants. 
            <br>&emsp;I sit in this place then where the specific elements of our discussion hold no substance, in both the subjects and members. It seems everyone has but a general view of things, but then gets held up by specific instances; but fail to bring any comparable detail to the realm in which that member is being scrutinized in. "Its like a small grain of rice is subject to measurement, but our scale only holds 5lb incruments." On the other hand, their is this pernicious expertise, whereby the general mold of things is given little regard, and instead select rules and details are submitted; which itself betrays the mountain of other details that would seem important, or relevant at any rate, to the subject which they thinnly depict. These are your pundants and specialists; who, more than the average viewers, hold their positions through facts. Yet, I am fully unconvinced to what they say, for even though they can speak to something to specific, their breadht in that regard is quite bare. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, you must be accurate to the entitites in question. For Donald Trump is a grumpy old Biggot, but so is he a man like many; father, husband, buisnessman, citizne. And it is generally our characterues and irritability that has us view his actions and effects in a overly dramatic and ill-foudned way. In fact, if we bent our views only to facts, in a certain scenario that is, you'd relaize that beyond our emotions there is not that much that will readily change. Which itself garners no severity of concenr. "And we must be against our specific fears that amount only to what could change in the near hand, but then let this carry us away to make equally ardent but contrastingly poor fears for the future -in that our detailed attempt fails." I think that it is quite hard to be so; and that in our defense of the good, I concede only that there could be something bad going on: yet of what nature or end, no one has properly said. The moment, in which our fears are measured against, are to slow and in need of being exact, that no real assessment is made. In fact, the scales only ever tilt slightly, for adjustments can be made within any sort of minor end; that even if time holds us to negativie sorts, so will it have been by inches which we progressivley addressed. 
            <br>&emsp;The general notion then holds much finer regards. For in this, specific things are not to be derived, in that if the murder rate globally is five per 100,000, then it is not fair to highlight and berate our positivirty on the fact that some did in fact die; when in fact, the density of so is so small, that it is in fact those small specks overly saturating us that remakrs such a response, as opposed to approtialy refelcting the substance. And, at any rate, the dealings of things is never of a general sort, as each thing is itself an individual, and subject to others of the sort. Theres just too many single gusts of wind that can describe whether one will amount to what another did. It is just the nature of that particular breeze and the interatcion it individually had. It is not, to be clear, poor of us to be generaly; but, it is usually to get context and sense; or perhaps settle us away from fearing what the specifics are -as in low murder rates suggesting little concern for us to investigae. The point being, that generally there are positive truths; at least beyond general depictions, the overall results are significantly positive (across many metrics too). And, be it the sole negative, or of those present in any measured sort, so are these in need of particular identification. And, as it were, the thin attempt to do so is not a valid submission for reprisal or concern. "For nothing specific overhwlems other specifics; which in this case is largley postivie. Nor is it a solid measure less the specific is accurately stated itself."
            <br>&emsp;In that though, I do not know what I particularly see. For my goodness and state is not a reflection of some statistic, but the actual course and way of our lives. Yet, in that there is no clear object. At least I am not so clear on the world I see, and thus our role derived. I think, that theres a notion of pace, and how it is proper to be; in that, be it in war or civility, one ought not produce violence. This is a rule you see, a gauge for conduct, in that it claims what actions are poor, in that they are forbidden. This, is seperatae from purpose, or our role at least. This would be like one enrolled in the militarty, to which their post would be one as a solider. As history has shown, violence may be required against that principle notion of doing so. In this case though, the rules of our heart run against the needs of our profession. To say what is proper for each though, is not fully understood. At least, what constitues each is not clear. Nor, in my definitions, is it evident that our role can come from our customs. "As if being kind were either the position itself, or marker of where our position should be -as a scale for approval that is." This isn't entirely fair though; as the point of non-violence is not that one should not enroll within a task that requires them to do so. In some sense, that task is out of our control; and in that our rule causes us to be defiant. Yet, who is wrong here, for this instance suggests their is some governing authority who you are defiant of. Are they correct? For it may be true that violence is no anwser and should be forbidden; but it is not itself a role to complete, rather a rule. In a way, what were asking is, if what we are tasked to do runs contrary to what we think our principle is, which should we obey. Yet, in that, I am wondering how both could be correct, in that we were in fact tasked with being violent, yet our principle said otherwise. It seems, that ultimately one is not likely true; as people's confusion may in fact be what were disobediant too; or perhaps their right and we are mistaken in our custom. 
            <br>&emsp;This is the hardest thing then; as all roads lead to this question: What ought we do. But this is not given by what we presume to be present; as if being non-violent is innate, and our discretion of purpose should lay itself upon that. I'd say the customs we follow should be born of the same discovery. In a similar fashion, if our goal was to build a rocket to the moon, then the dexterity and engignerring required would reflect our neccessary acquistion. "As if the skill were the requirmnet." So would communcation be privy though, as would gluttony run contrary to getting it done. Violence would seem to follow as something unneccessary; but do you see how it is from the goal by which our custom is drawn. In an old sense, people were led to believe that God was killed by the Jews, and that for reconcilliation -as to reach their own goals- pograms were required. In that, violence was appropraite, as it was custom for the completion of their task. By that, I think the only important thing is about that task. Which, upon agreement, can consider the place for elements so far convened. "As if, one did indeed think violence was appropriate for their ends; but in seeing their path was wrong, and a new one right, we could consider then how such an element of the other path was fitting for this new one. And, the fairest bit of truth, is that what is past, present or to come, will, but recalibration, repentance or continuation, abide and adjust by the soundest edge of approval: which itself, seems the most important to accept: but in that, welcome the surest means to acquiring it, as to acquire a truth which was not merely our own subject, but false against all things, but was rather full and rounded to such things and all of entirety." Our God then, or the one who's will we make a constant, is that entirety itesld. "WHich, is then what we must understand." Yet, as far as I am aware, the hardest task of reproach comes to further: as beyond subjects -which our whims are all to eager to meet- the actual forray into the realm of entitites, is not identified or described. "Which is to say, that our limit in this sliver of modernity -past the age of antiquity- one where of true things, we are without a clear figure or label: and thus our judgement and according amends, are past the point in which were currently privy." Yet, in that, if we see our final goal, makes the current step worth surredning to, and accpeting its demand. 
            <br>&emsp;Which is to first identify all things in their entirety.

        <div id="foractionssake">
            It seems, in brief, that our life is moving in a forwar direction. Whether this is to far off lands and with surrounding praise, I am with more doubt than not. But that we could soldify an auro of comfort, security and worth, that I am sure.
            <br>&emsp;It all comes down to those less then fair impressions, which ceaze us in our middling states and demand that we return to action for their sake. This is simply a hard thing to do; at least, as we remove ourselves from such complexions, so do their stains linger. Still, their prominence does fade, and going through the iterations of work and rest, you tend to define things -for a closing effect- that were suckling by your side.
            <br>&emsp;In that, I can say I am well, and moderatley so. Our aims and interests are not so heavily banked, as such ends feel poor and strained. While the seperation from that, has goverened me to be well in openess; to which our amends have been more communal and frequent. From this, there has been more consistency in those finer things I care about; as we are less pressed or idle in our restorative states.And, at any rate, be it these able means or the draw of these new sparkles, I am more confident and at peace with discovering and approaching things of fair want -ie. our writing, dating, careers and our life overall.
            <br>&emsp;It seems that our life is one which needs support; and by that, there is not much which can't be tailored where your effort doesn't lie. It seems that our need for some place different -beyond near term expectations- is based on somewhere far off drawing your anticipation; which itself, brings relief in that you have somewhere to go. Whereas, if we are idle, we tend to feel poor if there is nothing on the horizon. Yet, in that, we see that really all we need us cultivation. Be it of other committments, friends and relationships, work and purpose, and any liberal bends besides. This is not something which holds lingering wants or doubts; as the impetus for those is a lack of those formers. It is true that such disturbances can be mitigated; but so are we more privy to a constant state of acivity, in which the fuller roster of things is either discredited or ignored. This is a life of strain though, as you must eventually stop, revealling your discomfort or boredom; and at any rate, you tend to wear yourself thin as to avoid this; which leads to little constancy in those dearest actions.
            <br>&emsp;I think, admittedly, that their are shortcomings when it comes to our definitions. Even though there is a mountain of regard for them, so are their peaks no well formed. In that, it seems like assumptions of their place outside ourselves, or at least to some meaningfull end, are not prevalent. From this, we have loose if not figurative portryals of what those ends mean; which more often then not, bank on the perfection of our work, 'as to reflect the ultimate ends of such products'. In effect, our current openess has given us enough repraoch as to consider the more definite ways by which pleasure, purpose and success come to fruition. We are stable and able enough in our present state, as to withdraw from the far off imagery which till this point saturated our expectations. In this, the routes and paces required for such ends, are becoming more familiar and promising -at least their more clear as to their extent, and our place amongst such gradations. This, as mentioned, gives more direct and objective shades to the peaks of our inner delights; as their angles of fame, fortune and confidence, hold less imaginary sways but more clear sighted ends. This is quite pleasing, as we are more able to advance, all while humbly surrendering to the scope of the course were subject too. Meaning, that we know what is available for us to do; and we are present to an initial state, but also not so thin in our view of what comes further. In that, we can at least stand where we are knowing that our current claim is one sufficeint for what we want -or see as worth. "While there is no otherwise bound to our fantasies."
            <br>&emsp;In terms of our actual paces though, they are not so invovled in those coming ways. It is true that such paths are more revealing, and by virute of our admittence of their possibility, so are we more keen and willing to committ. But were tired, coming from a long period od wear. And a good sort of that, which continues still in these more moderate ways. But, the introduction of those promsing aspects is the reach of our stage; and be it the limits of our scenario, the need for more definement, or the pure priorities elsewhere or short-change of our eager regard, holds me from furthering in those matters. Again, the course is fine, and through the spring and summer there will be much where we can grow. And, at any rate, as I suspect by the fall the future post of our life will ahve settled, so will more subsinent gains be worked towards. But right now, we are still nourishing our liberal sorts. And even as moderate as we are, we are still subject to those dearest of ways. "Whereby the warmth and strucutre given, is for us to rest, feel free, seen and at peace, on our road to fecundity. As opposed to feeling freeo from active remission, and settling into a fairer pace which welcomes long term committments." 
            <br>&emsp;Here I'll end, which is on this note of energy. This is in reference to the purpose of our social affairs, and how their benefit is not so much in themselves, but in the relief and sustenance towards our creative ends. The thing, is that such ends bring their own priorities. On one hand, you have the principle which the best qualitiees favor. Yet, in this, I have no probelm, as wholesomeness has become my preferred flavor. Yet, this takes alot of the comforting sides of our sepeate committments; as the candor and shine which we'd have otherwise, in the prescence of others, being our true self, is not itself an object or beneficiary. Which in a practical sense may be the case in general. But, if we were more pronounced, or at least at peace in our place being merely there, then so could we see it as the point of cultivation. But its not, its seperate, good mind you, but adjacent to our creative intent. And this is fine, nor do its benefits come with much cost. Only, we are subject to our own life in this creative place. For, practically, there is not much to get in pleasure, purpose or fame regarding these recreational matters. Our excitment can be there though, at least from the possibility of being present to others; along with the suggestions and inquiry to toher matters that this experience brings. In that, being withotu such a flair removes what we could dream about or expect. At least, the more accpebtlae point of these committments finding a more secure and developing place amidst a future home, is one that sees the distance from such point a troubling notion. 
            <br>&emsp;What this all comes down to, is that it is hard to be magnificent during Yoga, Church and other curisoities, when in fact there is not much to expect beyond what our average stature would bring; nor is the upright edge of such candor one which rests outside of immediacy. Which, again, is fine, but this makes our whole life overwhelming. As our pursuits of creativty are long; and admittedly their point of interest, purpose and pleasure, is not one where we need do anything than enjoy and continue. But such a hearty yet tender bend, stifferns and draws reservation at the thought of being prestine in our outward committments. Which again, holds little in terms of what you get for showing up; for even if there is seomthing more to get -in that pleasure, fortune or prupose- so does this take much time.Which is to say, that no moment of excellence will procurr much; at least when compared to your general goodness and heart, showing up regularly. Perhaps, as the pleasure of our live surrounds the heartier elements of creativity and self regard, that the pleasure of being present to other people in our greatest way, is something we desired. For it truly does unveil more possibility, nearby or far off. Yet, this seems to be something worth avoiding; or at least in our discretion, is the wonder of these common things worth being pleased about when the demands to experience so are so large; which, weighing against our creativity, seems not worth it. At least, if our life can have its strucuture, soften through consistency, and otherwise treat us in being our dearest selves, amongst the world as we have, then that seems wortwhile and fair. 
            <br>&emsp;Practically then, our experience with Yoga makes me want to become fit, in both strenght and our own stability. This goes against our current state though; and having been to Yoga several times, I can see that our expansion there is in need of our own personal training. In that, I would attend where you can, but keep to reformative training; shouldering your efforts with pulling and lunges, while doing pushups and aerobics to bring your vitality out. Musical flow can surround this, all while twisting and restoring. "Our own private economy is in need of substance and itinerary, before our place in the market is secure. You may go though, but with the prioirity of whats done at home in mind." Shambala, amongst our other attended efforts, is the nicest and simplest. We show up at 730, usually keep ourselves off camera while everyone is in silence; then join for the contemplation and discussion after. Truly, theres peace in this; and so much as we can afford, we can align ourselves in our prferred ways. Besides this is TSU, which is short, familiar, and otherwise easy to come as you please. I have become known as a writer, but so is this for me to disocer what is good, rather than extract some strict benefit -from these people. As it were, we have converesed enough about it, and our prescence is not so prevalent in that respect; their not giving you anything but attnetion, but so is that for you to bring to actual light. Compassion on the other hand, albeit brief and with means to be seperate, is not terribly interesting, and is quite busy in my experience. Also, it comes between Shambala and Church, so it ends up being a morning duty, with not but the common company and its pleasure. Which is nice, but isn't a commitment. Which is what I see TSU as; though, it being so familair and civil, is one where benefit and converse can be had. But with no stakes to be there or not -and at any rate return.

        <div id="astakefornot">
            When I reflect on our biggest discontent, it is the lack of purpose that I feel, or when I do at least. This is so, compartiviely for instance, when I picutre someone else being called to action, to give a speech, to travel for for some purpose. Our actions tend not to feel so important; or at least, when they do, it becuase of the merrit in our stead; but so does this seldom materialize, or find any relevant traction. And otherwise, breeds this need of perfection.
            <br>&emsp;What I suspect is at the core of this, is that there are problems to solve; or improvments to make at least. And at any rate, there seems to be a poor, if not unbecoming approach to doing so. In that, I feel drawn, as if our call to action is one of bringing the truth we see. Even then, I can see how this is a aprameter for all; as having the solution, or means of progress, seems crucial for any in its possession. What I am thinking though, is that the truth we see is but a suscipion under a curious lens. While the prgornosis on display is more set within the competion and ad hominens; as if the anwser is knonw, but those running the gambit are misaligned. Whereas, in me, I see the truth unidentified or describe; whereby our reproach to such limit, is one of curisoiites. In that, my desire to move forth and share, is a reflection of that. And thus, it is not so much that what we suspect or feel is in dire need, but rather we just want to be open; at least, in or tender ways, we are less afraid to make the fair and common attempt to do so. For at least, over time reception will grow, but so will we feel preserved in our un-averse approach. "Where we would otherwise yeild to embelisshed wishes or concerns; stiffening us to not approach." 
            <br>&emsp;I'd say, formally, that leisure, inudsry and care mark the inner warmth of ourselves, while pleasure, purpose and success are outward sources of heat. It seems in the former case, that as our priorities station us, so will the exvess of that (which we call liberty) breathe in our reflections and delibertaions (as to align and decide what we'd do with such excess); with the elements of leisure, or play, industry, or craft, and care, of nature and things, as the embers of such flame. While, those outwar ventures seem like products of equally outward efforts; in acquistion lets say. Only, a question arrives, in that the stability of our core fortunes affords us an excess to be spent on those liberal ends; is there worth in taking some of that excess and applying it to more fortune? I would say the anwser rests on the notion of slack, whereby the peaks of those liberal ends need no perfection or stiffness to remain; and in that, the room they have to wander and slide, while remaining upright, is where you have liberty to horizontally grow. In that, as you extend, so do the princples and fuel that make those liberties (of play) rise, do so with equal color and lushness, but amidst a broader space. This is in concern of adding more prioirities in that outward sense, and that  even if our leisurley efforts are still upright withotu being stiff, that the force of the former will cause us to be crowder, or squished. This is indeed so when those liberties are risen with strain, and placing further effort to fortune stiffens the whole lot. Yet, if we let our the ripness and trunk of our riches settle with merriness, then the remaining excess can afford an expansion of the ground where they stand; as to make these additionall efforts not confining, as their products bring more width. 
            <br>&emsp;I think, that our fear of posting, practic eand submission is one of reputation; in that we know, or find at least, poorly place efforts as unpromsiing. It is not so much what  we need from this efforts and how those stakes make us fear failure. Instead, we are unsettled by our own poor efforts, and their restriction from us having even the small amount of desired success. For that is the point I think, that our greatness needs know audience or bounds, but slight converse and potential. Our actual forward motions can be drawn out later; or at least be pursued with a weifht that respects such purspoe. And, to reiterate, there is not this problem waiting for us to solve. As, even our mightiest anwser, will be submitted throughout the strands of things. Which, to be fair, accounts for someone being their greatest self, in that what they have to share is made best and thrown out; but so is the impact one that can only hope to be as much as it can; at least to remark our right step. 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, I can see the impetus for this all, in that we are not so constant in our compisure towards such paces. But this is also, on the large scale, subject to our developmental appraoch, whereby the near term is subject to habitiual impuiritues. And otherwise, the course of our life tends to even out under the lines of where it is going; withotu any recompense for where it is not yet. And, truth be told, it is hard, when you don't know exactly where that is; so that you are in fact not so privy to where your going. Our sense though of the world, and that where there are conditions that peoples and governments are ordained to this in their own localles. And generally, it is the complex of each one that is repsonsabile for their own conditions. We simply aren't there where we could make a big enough splash, as to change the world over there. But weidly, where my might could in fact impact, is not one where I am afraid to aviod. In a way, I see the world I am part of as one which could benefit in further positivity; whereas the real problems across the world as a whole, are ones or removing negativity. 
            <br>&emsp;In that though, I can see that what is really important to me, is in furthering our definitions which reflect a progrnastic turth for those remedies. While, the excess of joy that I see, is not bound for some purpose itself amongst our rich mediocrities. Only, in that, there is more room for a slack approach, whereby the brevity of sharing your positivity, is equal to the standard by which your sharing is judged. Which is to say, that it is really more for me, yet by that the standard is your own happiness. "Which, in my delight, is found quite simply." But whereas the approach to the world's remedies is a serious one, which judges me courselg in both our manners and product -to which their is a long journey- so are my introductions of color and joy, for those lacking problems around me, not something with any comparable severiyy, but something of possibility, our own pleasures, and community perhaps. But this has no consequrniaal edge; as if our compalcency throughout life woudl bar us from uncovering truths which actually impacted negativiy. In that, our writing, study, platforming and charm, is from me in what I give, and for me in what I recieve. "Which, in substance, means that we share in eachother's postivity, in that we receive eachother's excess's. But fear not that you would already be fine, and without subject to their own surpluss, while you were contendedly idle."
            <br>&emsp;In closing, this notion is a fine one, which we will merely describe. Simply, I look at my new local efforts, in yoga, zoom and churhc, and I think, that in regard to pleasure and comfort, their accesisble. But not for much more admittedly. Theres no stakes, merely something for you to otherwise attend to. Then, I look at our liberal efforts, and their present extent; and I think that for the most part, it is personally well. But, when I look at severity of those, all while being liberal, I see how there are but undefined sections that in fact reflect such common and personal times, but free and open to outward desires. This, in effect, means that there are places for us to be as we please, with the complexion of these liberal elements. In contrast, our serious venture of identifying all things, seems to be within the outward realm of things, whereby we really apply. This is different then our personal interest in writing finding a place with more energy and strucutre beyond ourselves. This is comparable to our Yoga, in that it is a place I want to go; but is for me, and beckons me not to either make something grand of it, or be great myself, as if we suppose to lead. We just go there. And while our civil ends have opened up in this respect, so ought our liberal ones; whereby we join classes, go to meet and greets, find platofmrs and forums to put our ideas, or whims at that. But easily, plainly; so much as vibes and fit spark your desire, that you would unapolegtically and for your interest sake, do so. Generally, we avoid this, as it tugs on our bareness of real purpose. Yet, that has been settled on finer things taking their too develop; in that we'd best express, rather than finally show up to be the final anwser. "Theres already so much going on; and your impacts are for far off places, which are already subject to their own liberties and organization." At any rate, as this has become settled, then so is our own happiness a free concern. And one, with its own promise, and perhaps ability to further those deeper matters; but not one which needs anything more than what it meens to pleasingly be yourself. By that, our trunk and core are essential; yet, in being so privy to that but not so worn or negagted as to lean on those true purposes so much, we can more casually and to our delight proceed in the civil realm. Whereby we submitt our writing not to change lives, but to solidify our own. "Which, the attempt is nearly enough."
        </div>
        <div id="beyondshivering">
            Lets be candid for once and ont describe the rules of things. It is winter, and that means the shivers of the land are common. Still, man's limit of resourcefullness is hardly tested here; at least, someone else has provided a solution which the rest of us can benefit from: being clothes. Still, it is not always comfortable, in an elegant sense, to be outside. In any case, one could compare the summer to this, in that it has its own shortcomings of comfort. On the positive side though, they generally share too. As, per the ease in which one can go outside, there is the question of what they'll see. In that, the warmer month's have fine mornings and peacefull evenings; while the winter periods have nice mid-days. At any rate though, the weather can ruin such party; be it of fog, overcast and streaks of hazed condensation, so can the scenery which our comfort delights, be covered. The point though, is that beyond their actual shades, the presence of good otherwise is nearly equal, and otherwise comparable in the weather their subject too. To be fair, the warmer months have less intrusive properties, as the colder months can have longer bouts of overcast. But still, for a barren tundra, the consistency of good is still present, however irregular.
            <br>&emsp;As it stands, the current comforts are somewhat mild, as a breezy chill has come over the hills and muddled the previous coolnees -into an actual chill. But, this seems but an odd occurence, as the time for warmth is reaching a return; or at any rate, the harshest moments are far behind us; while those considered less preferable, are nearly past our side. 
            <br>&emsp;My active time then is gaining a slight rise, in that we have more room and reason to go out, be it of leisurely or fitness sake. And, since the advent of electric scooters, so are we more eligble to wander and explore. At least, in the earlier days of the freezing cold, so were those ventures fine then. "And not even a puffy cloud was presnet; or leniancy of wearing anything short of several layers: think of the summer and spring! And our fearless return -marking true progress, as we have no need to reset (via a burdened pause)."
            <br>&emsp;Besides that, everything is circumstantial. For it could have been that we were sentenced to death 3 weeks from now, and that such present could be as it is (in the winter) or the heat of summer. In that sense, our disperions of excellence and perfection comes at a unique time. For one, the actual means to getting around, luckily, is  made so by our access to a car; yet, in this for me personally, there is some bagge: though the heart of our intentions gives leave for it. I only mean, that besides the acceptable amount of negativity, that the cold and timing of getting our scooter, means that the ease and excitement of actually attending these commitemetns is less; in that, if we were going to Yoga at night, we could scooter somewhere before and watch the sunset. Which, we could admittedly do while driving; but so does that means of transport drench such interest, or at least muddy my sight of it. On that note too, is our actual place of living. As being in Kamloops affords no clear roads or short connections; while our foresight of Vancouver seems to offer such refinements. "And all the spots of wonder and peace that surround that -be it on route, back home, or for ease."
            <br>&emsp;I can see the spring coming. And, as fact, we will not be able to go on the course to any good extent. Having a scooter is a strange thing; at least as our neighborhood is plopped up on the flat top of a hill, so are we kept from the fields below. So, by circumstance, we are privy to the nearby routes. Though, I can't ignore the fact that we have had a scooter, used it, enjoyed it, and learned how it can be usefully and happily incorporated. And likely, this will be acquired by the time that the our home changes. By that, we can access the edge of the greens near the bottom of the hill. Or, we can go to spots near the eastern edge, or closer to the further eastern top. At any rate, there are small nooks for us to sit; which, to  be fair in their negativity, limits us in quickly reaching a nice place to read. But a brief walk is not outside our bounds. And, at any rate, hower well or not that constant is, so are we able to go for drives; be it for that, or to stop and see. Moreover, we can go down to the fields and go east, up the yellowknife into Valleyview, or west in downtown; or we can stay to fields right beneath us, and sit somewhere quite while we read and see the moutains around. Even then, we can go a bit further to the land surrounding the industrial zone. And, if were feelin lucky, we can go to North Kamloops -from either of the bridges to the other. I can see, as it gets warm, when the suns sets further north, and theres clouds more commonly in the sky, that we can go to these further extents, in the afternoon or evenings perhaps, and generally be remitted from our otherwise homely dormance. Also, on two quick notes, is that as the morning and nights become at least cool, so will rides be accesible then -for treats in one and sunrises in the other. Secondly, is that in Kamloops it does not rain; and so this awkard need to store your scooter inside is unneccssary; as our confidence in the right lock blows any concern of security; and as for its health, so are the elements nearly always tame. It is true that when your in a place that has more variety, that some arrangement will need to be made, or concession at least -to use other means of travel when the elements are poor. Or, as I see some merrit, is in scouting nearby spots that are covered; and then relying on the security of your locks. "For in any case, it is not how far you go that makes a scooter safe; but rather the lock, and the openess of where it is locked. And whether you leave the perfect spot to walk 10 mintues away, is moslty besides the point, as time is the only other factor. But still, during the day especially, and in particualr when there are eyes about, the exposed nature of it keeps it from being laciviously seen -and the lock is reassuring at any rate."
        </div>
        <div id="rolesofjoy">
            So we muight simpligy things like this. There is your God given role, in that you have a body and it must do what that body does. Breathe, eat, sleep, secure. And, as it were, our initiall ooh oohs and aaw aaws were not much more than that of a monkey, or other animals of the sort. But, due to certain properties, we grew more success in our enviornemnt; by the advent of tools we'll say. And, akin to that civil notion of agricultures stability affording developments into the civil realm, so would it make sense that our icnrease security gave rise to increased identification of things. In a primal sense that seems fair. Then, as the modern world came to be, so was there writing, or representaions at least. In that, the measures of discourse were employed, whereby we'd speak of subjects through the tools of explanation and consideratin. This, compares to perhpas our primal sophistication, where our intial expansion of the memebrs we could point to, held no complex regard with how we dealt them. And, as I see it, our current sense of why were so intellengince, is really a remark of us truly being so; only, in that, I only see that we have learned how to make transitions and descriptiors in our statements. "As if we have learned how to speak about things in finer ways, beyond the actual ability to mention things at all."
            <br>&emsp;The point, is that our ability to speech and its station having developed out of our primitive capactities into one which reflects this world of inquiry and craft, is but a developed configuration of our otherwise normal body. By that, we may have these properties to us which grant civil freedom, and otherwise employs remarkable ingenuity and craft; but as tools and lens of the body, which then means that such mental faculties are balanced ontop of the needs of the lower faculties below. Of a muscular, respiratory, digestive and immune kind. "Which in fact is how our mind can function, as its parts use more of what those other bring in."
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, we are all within a condition. Which, is not for the sake of argument gravity, but the practical relations of our bodies requirments and the enivronemtns withdrawrawl from us acquiring so. Yet, in that we have means to try; and as it were, Man has come above those muddy grounds and built roads,and vehicles at that. Still, he must maintain those roads; and otherwise keep himself approrpaitley placed as not to get distracted at other producs of our proficient times. At least, those marginal elements of luxury, substance and gratuity, have no place within our condition; which, in its right, marks our need for food, security (of country) and a bed. 
            <br>&emsp;If we have that then we are proportionately fine. Yet, a problem has arisen though in recent times; whereby the success of these marks doesn't lead to a life which is enjoyable. At least, it seems that the means to these few aspects is not a troubled proposal for some people; and with all the extra freedom available, they make eithe poor choices, or none at all. And it is that latter point that has brought colors (of grey) to the sentiment of nihilsm, anaarchy, determism and overall existence. And to be clear, not everyone who has a a roof and bread is so pessimistic; but I would say that most people outside this slice of folk who are so begrievd, live commonly besides this in ways that are either full of other responsability, or promiscuous and gluttunous. 
            <br>&emsp;In a sense, each member reaches an excess, whereby their needs are met and the surplus effort is spent on something more; be it increased benefits to our life, the pleasures of the world, some more purpsoefull, or otherwise a middling indolence that begins to coarsen as it breathes, as too much time is spent withdrawn. 
            <br>&emsp;I think beyond the nature of man and what he needs, and at least the insights of how things truly are and how our entire species should be, is this personal problem of excess. As, it indeed leads to discovery, advancement, uprisings and change. But the consistency is quite broken; as besides those riled up enough to rebel, or those able to marshall themselves privately for the sake of curisoity, the common man is one merely employed, and bent to meeting those duties as suitably can; but, over time at least, when doing so, he comes to that point of excess. "Picture a 59 year old man, whos a welder for instance; who, with a family and home, has provided; and perhaps in his yougner years he did so pleasantly and with other enjoyuments around. Yet now, he simply goes to work then comes home; and whether he sinks into a bottle, or merely hunches back and watches tv, I suspect, or at least their is a sort of common figure of this, where theres some irritable, curmudging grump, who complains, feels bothered, and is otherwise in denial of anything wrong, for his post (I belive) is so inportant, that being kept to it has pushed all things out, yet fairly as such attendance is needed to do."
            <br>&emsp;And so, we must as a rule, address the consistent place of duty in our lives. For if were politicians then our perfmance will be continuall judged; or if were buisnesmen or merhcants, then we will also be under the scrutiny and approval of customers and market conditions. Equally, if we are farmers, then our tasks will keep as long as the sun rises; or if were scientists, then so will the lab remain, drawing our curisoity, but holding our committment. None of our needs will change: and thus their means.
            <br>&emsp;For instance though, there is this common motion, whereby our fortune gives us room to work for more; or at least, upon reaching a point where our lower fortunes come to stability, we then work to improve -or acquire more at least. For me, this is its own point of excess; as the additional qualities of life are but that, add ones, extras to those which we could not choose otherwise. In this though, I think the value of ceratin qualities hold more flavor then others. In short, the things of our lives beyond stability which are wortwhile, are those, on a basic level, which afford our flow of life a pace of consistency, substance and ease. Nothing we do should cause concurent negativies; and hangovers are a clear mark of that. Nor, should our efforts be bent on ends which are outweighed by the effort; and extravengece tends to reflect that. Or, on a similar note of the caliber of substence, it should be itself measures along these lines, in that the experience was not brief, hollow, brittle, expensive or vain; but rather, it should elevate you, lighthen, speak to the tenderness and might which you have to embelleish; and otherwise it ought be respectable, convienant, steady and pure. A volunteer earns such favor, in that they feel committed for meaningfull ways, nor do they have any impusle to hide -as if the acitvity were unbecoming. Nor does their engagment end with dessert or the dreams of tomorrow, but the generous paces of the day, usually through and through. A soldier, caked in bravery, ears his accolades comparably, in that it is his enrollment withni the post, regardless of where the efforts of that take him, which earns him the admireation of others, and at any rate the demand of strenght -but perhaps neccessarily so.
            <br>&emsp;In short, there ought be something positive, and abundantly to our excess efforts. If our natural condition is too be warm, then we only need so much; and if too much heat is given, then we actually get hot, which inflammes our need. And at any rate, if we consider our self stable, of being warm that is along with secure and fed, then the continuation of that will be accounted. Weirdly though, the constance of our working lives need regard our excess. For, if in a moment we are stable, but then go to the bar and fall drunk over, then our return to work tomrrow is achieved with less ease, or ability in some instances. In that sense, our excess efforts -that which our work affords- should not hinder that work. At least, if our stability is waining, or at least expected to decreese, then we cannot say that were solid.
            <br>&emsp;And that is the gauge mind you, in that beyond our working capacties, if we were then to judge it and the excess efforts of pleasure, purpose and further success, that our solidity was what marked whether we did things well. For even in those primitive times below, the sliver of surplus evidently gave rise to a free moment to look up at the stars. But even then, we can see how even those moments of real profit, winded themselves into something negative. And, at any rate, the roots of those mystical extensions of ourself, eventually wore out the required means to addres the natural core of ourselves. That is, when the governments of medieval europe were clerically bent, so were the priorities, anticiaptions and knoweldge of the realm unbanked against the possible threat of disease, whereby the urban realities of the time made such ends a certainty. "We let our primal times of superstion root itself over a millenia into the authorative realm, whereby the basic measures of hygene were not adminsitered well enough: and nearly half the continent died."
            <br>&emsp;What this means for me then, is that liberty, being the finest of those excess', holds no private bar for you to do so. There are problems of the world, and your natural curisoity may lead to mighty suggestions; but this path is long as it is great. And, considering where we are, we are still only at the point where suspciion turns into theory.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, the point at hand then is when it comes to you, your time is all thats at hand. By that, you surely wan't your free time to be liberal, in that it was filled with moments  of leisure, industry and care. But so in this, can you feel drawn or delighted to some surrounding end; such as a bookclub, a meeting, a gathering of sorts. Doing so is really up for you, as it brings you otuside your personal matters and shines them in an open light.
            <br>&emsp;The problem, has always been that our liberal ends were to hunkered on their supposed purpose. And that because being outside ourselves can make things lighter, we choose such hidings. Now, I understand that our interest in writing can epxand, or mingle, where it finds delight; at least, with the pace of meagerness and peace you can try. And at any rate, it would seem that those perfected theories, are suceptible to everyone else by your prescence to others. Obivously the world around will not be privy to me already; but to other nodes of people, so will that come from our own node. And in that, we must balance the weariness and shame at not being so prognostic and great, with the more common unions of ourselves with friends. That is for me at least, and my ideas and their breadht are subject too that. And, for pracitcal and beneficiary reasons, along with your own constance and tranquillity, so is that better mark of you being in this opened ways, a converging benefit for your own time and those ideas. In fact, they seem to be one in the same; for as it were, their lineage is one out of spite and privation. Yet, without any common place or minglings, we held to far sights for what our ideas could achieve; or at any rate what would be required for them to grow. And this need not be so, for we are more ingraced to the commons; whereby we can see freely the time and pace that our grandeur needs. And otherwise, settle into our own merriment, and rest on the notion of the products which come from that: for in all mans problems, the support is already made: and when it comes to its postive end, so are we responsabilie for ourselves. "For that is what draws others out." And, in a way, it seems that our bounty of positoivrty will refine into according ideas: but are thus born from that continious stream of your merry self. So be

            Im not quite sure what I should do. On one end, there are problems, at least there are things which reflect our inadqeucies, as opposed to the natural ends of mortality. On this note, there is the protection of the products of those ineffeciences; yet, part of me thinks that the root source is the real concern. At least, it is strange to think that you would be well off yourself, and not see, or at least ocnsider such source.
            <br>&emsp;On that end you have the quandery of form and void, and its remark on the meaning of things and thus our lives. My position, is that all our worries come from the manglings of speech and its correlarlay with thought; and through our ill-wisdom too that and the ignorance of what these facotr are, our anticaptions and worries take on the realm of dreasm, whereby we poorly use the faculties which are in fact dismayed. By that, I see the nature of things, be it form over void, void being released into form, or some other singular union (of a asietic sort perhaps); which, as fire is kinetic and butter savory, so are our words and thinking euqally part of the domain. And again, all I see is that our words and ideas get jumbled when they are themselves questioned. Yet, in that, I see no history of struggle from those without regard. Rather, those who helm their words, or at least have enough thinking as to address all things including their thought; whereby the tyrants of innaccuracy and superstition reign over our head. "As if the things which our words reflect, are so too things which are not themselves refletable; yet, our mind has a tricky nature in this case, whereby its reality is not so privy to be free from seeing things in what they really are, and not being confused for what is otherwise fit for a dream."
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, this is our measure of truth. And by that, we see that there are prime factors which govern our society; the mending of which would bring less unjust products. And, to be clear, there is no shame, and in fact there is courage and high regard, for defening against the sparks of injustice. But so too are we subject to ourselves; which holds no passion for others, in turmoil or fortune. In that, we know that beyond people suffering more than even our worst is, that we still have our own responsabilities, of continuation too. 
            <br>&emsp;The trouble comes when those stabilities and their constancy create a profit, or excess; whereby we can deliberate and attest to things past those stabilitites. In this, the call to action is fair, in that one can surely afford to spend their time helping others if they are indeed well off themselves. But, the question then, is whether the duty of free men is to tamper the flames of societies uneveness, or to actual even it out. "Mend the negativity, or create positive change." 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, it pays to be aware of how things are, in both crime, civil services, commerce and disease. By that, you realize that your place cannot be in saving them all; as one's attempt to aid those with tuberculosis, settles them away from fighting crime. In this sense, the positive element is whereby one seeks a cure, as to curb any misfortunes. While, those who fight in wars, work in the field to treat illness and death, act as ointments and medicines to the misfortunes being made. In that way, the ineffieceinees of government lead to conflict, and be it at the back via the diplomats or on the frontlines with weapons, we must address said flames. Only, the great men of the world are not those who showed such moments of support; but rather the Hume's of the world, the Emerson's, the Smiths; those who thought, devled and conjured the means to stronger roots as not to produce such negativity. 
            <br>&emsp;Think of it, if the world worked, along the lines of commerce  lets say, as it had a millenia ago, would we have as much money? Management is one thing, and our ability to generate the goods of the market is the other; but generally, the bones of our world are in government; and via those commerical advents, so is the mold of government which permitts, and angles it at any rate, to take the form and shape it does. In that, the efforts  of man have not only risen with respect to welfare, but also in the nourishment of the economy. Nor is the global tilt of this a poor one. In that sense, the long term is perhaps what carries the weight of positivty; as those, along with taking time to cultivate, take comparable durations to manifest. While, the subjects of the current status are in need of immediate attention, as their symtpoms are acute. "Born from chornic aiilemtns of the roots, but flairing up at the given moment."
            <br>&emsp;I guess as a man, I am lacking, for I put little effort into helping those around me. Personally I am not so set, but those nearby do likely donate, and perhaps volunteer at a shelter, and otherwise are enrolled into public rolls which provide services. Me on the other hand, lacks such a place.

        <div id="rightandcommon">
            My reflections are quite different then my deliberations, in that one has to do with me, while the other is bent towards the law, or at least something I am supposed to do. It is hard to say; especially if the minutia of the discussion is one tht ultimately lies in you, yet a sound reflection of that would measure up to a supposed rule. 
            <br>&emsp;I think the friction to our thought is in considering what we like, wbat we seek, what would measure to me some amount of pleasure, purpose or success, and looking at the obligations we have as a man, concerning the troubles of those in poor parts of the world, the ludicrous yet mentionable disruption of sex and racial differences, particularly. One one hand, I don't see much value in changing anything but the truth. For even if we tear it all donw, what will replace it? There may be improvments, but at that, it  seems like the proper design is paramount. And in that, I see little in terms of perfection; at least and rounded amount of depth. Plus, at any rate, if you consider the requirments to acquiring such truth, then you'd realize that your time was properly spent pursuing that. You may then go and rebel and carry over this new design; but so is the former without the latter premature; nor is it entirely warranted, for some of your reasons for revolting are not bound to a full truth. 
            <br>&emsp;It seems then, that if the truth were known, then the actual problems, or at least issues which were fair to attest, could be addressed. At least our action could be appropriately made -and lack any misplaced assumptions or conflations. Though, it seems that, beyond removing people by force, that since our authorities are elected, that education was the prime factor, in that those representting us will be so from an oriented populous. 
            <br>&emsp;This is beyond the point though. For I don't think theres any sense in attributing the blame of instances to summarized groups; as those are full of seperate members. And even if were talking about the government and its institutions, so are these divisions at best, and their own intracies at that. If it is true that a certain part of one group is causing trouble, then to them all we should reject. But we shouldn't identify the division as the entire problem; or conflate rather the errors of some of its members for the group as a whole -as that then points to members who are not in error. We can address the leadership and any policy which is selecting for or permitting such poor proclivites to manifest; but to a good extent, it is not the bosses crime to be an authority over someone who actually commits such crime. Change in his respect is fair, as is his releavnce as the authority a means to ramification. But that is not the point of other members, be it as workers or higher ups, who are not so directly responsabile for some indidvudals mistakes.
            <br>&emsp;These are broad terms though. As, the truth in all things is unknown; and when it comes to economy, civil rights, our quality of life and the general moldings of governance and service, so are we ill-defined in our view of these things, in an entire way at least; nor, to my point, have we actual given much thought to the facts of the matter. At least in that case, we would be mulling over the reality in play; while it seems more common for people to have reactions to thin impressions. And even if they are accuracte, so is that just a case. I am unconvicned that anyone knows alot about all; and there seems to be even more who know even alot about a little. And the point, is that on either side, so is our judgement required, or understanding at least. "In other words, our problem solving hasn't even begun, in that the reality of the situtation hasn't been identified or expressed." Also, to mention, those are sound in their awareness, but of a select part of the domain, are not themselves arbiters of other parts. And, weirdly, its odd how much even our specalists compare to those common and  feckless, in the areas which they are not specialists in. Or, case in point, if they are aware of a certain area, have they even given it thought? For I suspect they haven't, by virtue of their lack of reproach and assembly in the rest of the domain.
            <br>&emsp;Its just not the case that the absolute truth is one that is out of our favor. At least there's no strenght to this that is poorly stated. And otherwise, when it comes to the state of our lives, the best of us have problems whcih are generally self made, and are otherwise reminsicent of us not being the best version of ourselves -where we notice oppertunities slipping through our hands. Otherwise, when it comes to those who are worse off, so are they randomly produced; and on a larger scale even where some areas have more propensity, so are the misfortunes done to memebrs of that, which is itself random, or select. Whether these instances are the result of our primitive state, such as our less then democratic means for government, or are made through reprehensible means, such as genocide and corruption, fairs some distinction. But the accuracy for each ought to be the same; and at any rate, the proper representation should afford our reosltions as so. For, if a man is beaten due to discremination, then the attacker in question shold be dealt with accordingly. If we then extend this to other instances, we ought be clear on the details of those and the brevity to the patters, or relfections at least of any system which we'd then oppose. Personally I can speak to this not; yet, I am only on the psotive side which all things fall; yet admittedly ignoratnt to the details of what is presnet, however insubstanital it naturally is. But, the abbrasive opinions of those who profess otherwise, seem without any case. Their frustration isn't poor, nor is the repition of what they see an unfair reason for their response. But the range in which their criticism applies -being the entire police- is one which their arguments can't support. And again, the material which they reflect is not one of either inconsequence or pure abscence. But in my own igornace, I see that their response is one from a bounty of instances; yet, these don't total up enough in that front facing context to proprly explain or justify their response. And at any rate, my suspicion (wihtnin my ignoprance) rests on the likely small substance which their worries apply. As, the homicide rate of the world being (similar to the US) 6 per 100,000, I would not say that this suggests a rampant mishandling of police -or homicide prevention. And in regards to police brutality, if the number were a thousand even, I would say that this was somewhat substantial; but still, at least as we'd suspect that there were much more instances dealing with the police then that, would have me fairly believe that the brutality in question was uncommon -or present in a minority of situations. Which again, if the subsatnce is enough to really draw concern -beyond assessing each circumstance, but the theme- I still would say that argument agains the police system as a whole is an entirely weak one. Though I will stop, as I cannot securely vouche for the limits or extent of such concerms.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, theres nothing I know that doesn't point to inefficines and stale truths being the cause of negativirty. As oppposed to thinking the entire system is at fault, its really just the maturity of it, and reference by whicb it acts, that causes the members inside to perform and produce as they do. So I see no problem beyond the desired refinements which would lead to less instances of concern. But here, the call to action by the public seems hollow. As, learning the truth isn't soemthing that we throw to congress, or our representatives even. At least as a point of critiwue. Our place is in electing those who we believe to have the right ends in mind; and by that, educating those who vote, and even those who'd run, seems the fairest. Still, the treatment of the public and its effects is a daunting task; and hardly one that can be used against someone in not pursuing; particularly, when it is not the case that someone has a cure and fails to notify anyone; but rather that they'd find a cure for all, and failing to work for that is wrong. I think not. At any rate though, if I had some values and suspcion, then I could run myself and more direclty propose the changes I see. Even then, the truth is required. Nor is any large amount of people pursuing this; so I don;t feel like even the most furled brows are giving me or anyone scorn for that. In fact, we public oppostion to government seems to be in the core ways its managed. Ignorance of such functioning and division is hefty mind you; but at any rate, people don't care for the executive, nor those in charge of insitutions; nor do we see much more than advantagous selection in the high courts and things of similar caliber. Curriculum and polciy within public services may be one thing, but understanding the neccssary workings of such unions and how they can afford to change, is all we can be right in addressing. "And again, who knows enough to ask questions regarding that, and fair ones at that; and make suitable suggestions too." Its just hard when the world has some trouble, yet all there seems to be is a facade of those actuall involved with trunning the thing, and a layer of ignoratnt opposers who scrutinize that authority; but again, they usually do this in an all too general way, or if it is of someone speicifc, it rarely translates to how they are in non-related issues. "Like, what would be better, a genuis murderer who had the punctuality and means to solidify the economy; or a harmless nut, who held not much more than kindness and stupididy? We can take the latter sure, but at least not pretend like the former's abilities were the concner. At least, we'd be making the worst mistake, which is conflating one's personal actions and efforts, with seperate and irrrelvant issues. Trust sure, but at least hold some regard for the merrit in their resolution. Perhaps you could learn then, and elect another to run such attempt."

        <div id="fromoutandin">
            Lets  say that our flow of life is in question. What this means, is that we are with ease, acceptence, security, along with love, wonder and strenght. How this is achieved though can be quite messy; as many things run contrary to one another. And at any rate, our effects from any of these can often render our awareness of things to be muted. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, much time can go, where some good is gained, while some is falterer; or too much bad made at any rate, and not enough dealt with which was fully in your control.
            <br>&emsp;The point, is that as this time goes on, that coming to terms with possible improvements, or remissions at least from the bad, can leave you with a mix up of aims and efforts. For none can idenitfy a mistake, and look to proceed as though the effect had been washed off; nor, the remedy ingrained and the alterantive run through.
            <br>&emsp;That is the point of discourse, as it bears wisdom to us in terms of the supposed course we should take. Some take their cues from testinonies of others, while others subject themselves only to reason. The latter seems better; though, a mistake can be in thinking that the measure for success is in meeting the reason delivered; as opposed to the user of the reason actually beenfiting. Which is to say, that reason runs our discourse, as to consider what is valuable and to inquire as to what things or actions fit. By that, reason is a scale, a level if you will, as to judge and dispose our actions so that they are more becoming and fair. In that, the results will be of actions which treat us to an experience we seek. "Which at the end of the day, is the basis for our reasoning, and thus assessment -where we find suitable canditates for the former's conclusion [what is good for what we desire]"
            <br>&emsp;In that scale we have decided that the quality of our life should remarkt the actual living. Where it gets complicated, is how in the shades of that can be forwardly bent; just as they may be worn out from weighing effects from the rear (or past strains). In that, the point is not to give the future little regard, nor forget the past, but to marshal ourselves across the points of living,  as to be considered, executed and accounted by values which remark how well we actually are. 
            <br>&emsp;Generally this amounts to a reductive state, as one may resolve themselves to be a politician, or a professional no less, but give little regard to the benefit given. The core sentiment rises, in that such person will likely be aware of the effort required to reach certain developments, and how money for instance, will be accordinglyt provided. Yet, the value of effort needed for such money to be received, is not what is in itself bad or good; only, these are things, items, subjects for judgement: and reason is our scale. And all she says, is that if you have to go over a mountain to receive a moment's reward, that this is not accessible or lasting. Compared to the efforts reminesicent of self regard, those are quite frequent in their accessibility, nor do their gains wain. Moreover, the complexion of the flavors are ones of a wholesome kind, whereas those who travel to visit some far off wonder, have but a brief period of novel excitement and awe. "What happens when you return home: will that wonder be employed for the goods there? Why did you need to go then if there was already so much around? Did you really need this shot of grandeur to see what was beautifull in the commons? And if you didn't know what was there, and thought only exoctic places could present something great, then what confidence should I have that you'd even see it there? Its as if your pallete was flat from tasting little local cuisuine; and so you went afar to try foriegn flavors; yet where is your ability to recognize those."
            <br>&emsp;It seems then, that in our case, the quality of our time is subject to the enivronemnt. For we are indeed split from the mobility which we experienced time ago. Nor, do our attendances have any leisurely means to reach them. This is fine, but does remove the finer coatings of these events: and they thus feel more like obligations then fun activities. Still, there is much to be said on the general scale, of being unreserved enough to stop in your moving tracks, and recuperate with the ease of rest and lighter activities otherwise. I can say in our personal state, that such form of things is accessible, albeit less than ideal. And at any rate, the rural nature of our living keeps the bounds of these affairs at a limit. Though it is appreciated that the kinds of things we'd do otherwise, are available, just not in number or novelty. 
            <br>&emsp;This at any rate gives me much hope for our future, whereby we move on to more urban lands. Right now though, I have but the surrounding itineraires and their offer of warmth, conpousre and pace. While the center, has its core in me with our liberties and delight, and otherwise affords more bounds from leniance, integrity of depth and desire, and otherwise an otherwise felicious use of resources and time, as to afford ourselves more impatcfull means of satiating ourselves -ie. our scooters ability to bring us around.
        </div>
        <div id="sheddingthepast">
            I don't think we are being asked much. Sure, if we were keen, or at least privy to something and a prompt to it, we'd amend; but our real actions, or bearings at least, seem to come from our happiness, and whether or not we are in fact so, of whcih our actions tend to freely come by -or hanker at the means to being so happy.
            <br>&emsp;By that, I can't think of anything more than what we are ripe to do. In that, I see that our unhappiness is in fact due to the nature of our interests; in that they were not of a skilled sort, but creative; whereby we set off on nothing more than to contribtue; yet were not so privilaged to have the open means to do so. Again, if we had some skill or credit, than our route could be direct. But as it were, nothing is what were starting with, and were making something from that. It seems then, that any pursuit of these kinds we'll see you in a barenless state, of success at least. But still, our invovlement can still bring purpose and pleasure; and otherwise solidify our grounds as to more easily and plentfiully sprout industry, attention and care. In that, I am not so grieved at the reality of our coming ways; whereby before, there was but a step into all; while now, there is many. 
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, the struggle is one of adjustment; whereby our hopes and exepectations were of those grander sorts. These, as it seems, come to those who have been consistent. And the virtue of promise is that no justification is required in terms of time, only effort. But still, as the mass of those anticipations wane, so are we left with our head up high, excited to do more, and then pleased to see what such course can offer. But we have to enter, our first day, a new month, the apprentice period. 
            <br>&emsp;Oddly, I can attest to the ease, peace and outlook of our fragments. Which, as it was, held much dissmay on the early part of the road. But now, that we see our writing, dating, career, and even our more casual invovlemnents set for our openess to finally spring on, you'd think that this primary effort from earlier would unveil some of the unneccessary worrying; and otherwise instill some confidence that our fears will wain; or are at least unmerrited. 
            <br>&emsp;It just seems like our efforts are one, that the more we do, and that or place becomes one where another step is the task, we loose our grand scheme, our idle ambition; and otherwise, there is much impetus placed on us, be it in our hopes of being impressive, or justifying our way of living. These, are but marks of an unactioable mind. And at any rate, in our private ventures, so were the early outputs of that reassuring to those around me. By that, if our grandest step is in fact set on the first part of a thousand, so are we fine to feel secure. And, by our fragments, we are still going, and that seems to be recieved well. Or, in another sense, we are not asked much more than too try; and the only critcism received is when we don't.
            <br>&emsp;In that it is only up to you, that you can take this following step, whereby the armor and sights of old are removed, and the meager progress of the real world is your claim, and vantage point at that. We can do this. And at any rate, I think we will be happy. I am not sure if there is this big problem to solve, and by me at least. But, whatever we could do, on the scales of our real ability and merrit, is one that only comes about when action is taken. By that, we may be humbled; or, more likely, a mix of reality will come into the given promise of trying. At that, we may be right to simply be happy, putting our writing on a suitable platform, dating, looking for work, and otherwise framing our realm of living as we please. "The base of that is quite grown admittedly, from our scooter to the meager amount of work required; and its fair nature at that." 
            <br>&emsp;We just need a future that is going somewhere. And not by virtue of employment, as to our dream or hasty enrollment. But from action, which breathes a sense of continuaty, and the ease and foresight treated by that. 
            <br>&emsp;Where can you go, or be, and what? This is all that needs be know. For that pressing weight of where it will go, is really from the minor pinch of not being invovled at all. "And doing so, is alright."
        </div>
        <div id="looseclarity">
            I feel like I know so little of what is true. Our past has come, yet the recent memories are one where the future is more peacefully apparent: yet I cannot approach it. In some sense, I feel bad in not doing so; and considering the good there would be, or at any rate the poor remark for the occupation we don't have, so is there an opening to me which feels smeared upon, by my mother in particular. Still, we are just ironing our way; and be it thorugh some local attempt, or one which reaches the stars, we are rooting ourselves towards that.
            <br>&emsp;Theres just this question; as to why we are so troubled, and whether or decisions are really basing themselves on the right thing. Again, the remedy I seek is to this perceived apathy; or, worse, the unawarenss from others, and the sole relation I have with my mom and dad bearing upon me their suspicion. In that however, I don't know where I should go. I am having a hard time to say. And in this, we are admittedly unset, or arranged for some end. The grieving from this seems secondary then, as even if we were on our own, fortunate even to distract ourselves from our lack of consistency, or committment at least, so would the colors of the world eventually wain. We need some purpose, some why, some direction that keeps us set, to somewhere I know. Still, it is possible that our idling time is but the source of this; for we are not so privy to contempt or certainty when we are engaged. And perhaps, the development ware on us and its consequent privation, has led me away from common nourishments that would otherwis be accesible, and treat you to a point of consatnce, and thus no idling despair. 
            <br>&emsp;Theres just this thing, like we have an anwser. Or better, as I'd describe, is this intuition that if we just focus on ourselves, then the reflections, deliberations and output of that will grow to a point of vibrant solidity. And there is truth in that; both in the product, and our insight to the neccessity of ourselves in doing so; whereby we give ourselves leave to attend other things, and thus receive the warmth and security that our pleasure, peace and work require. Yet, in that vital state, the imagery I see is not so clear; or at least it affords no defintion. Or, in a way, it holds nothing that our actions can meet, in terms of the image at hand. It seems, in this case, that what we see is our work being spread; at least, as we have merrit, so are we keen to expect attention. Yet, having the work is different then spreading the work. As well, friends fall in this line, whereby your invovlement with things would surely expose you to more; but an infatution with yourself would not neccessarily follow, but instead require you to make relations as you would in your everyday stead now. Even then, when we consider what we would like in fortune, it is the ability to move; as doing so gives breadth and relief from our stale scenery. This is a mighty wish, and large in its requirmewnts to let its whims go out. Yet, the practice of it is really broadened due to your unoccupation; whereby, being so, removes all lust, and places your attention on the scenery at hand. It just seems like there is our private assembly, and the world outside our door; which draws hope born from interest, but also settles as the only point of progress which our family and heart suggest. Yet, the actuall things which would make you happy, or at least the elements which your idle mind sees in that broader world, is nothing which your localle couldn't provide. And, the point, is that even if that worldly view came to fruition, so would those elements be acquired no differently; or, at any rate, would not come due to the complexions of that wordly way. Instead, it seems, that if we are happy then we are open; and the prudsih side of our otherwise private heart, is drawn to an increase of that happiness through the world. Yet, all this remarks what that world doesn't even provide. What you wan't is to do as you please and feel unmitigated; yet, in our personal occupied lives, the amount of external occupation is small; and by that, relations, meaning and skill, come to fruition simply. Only, in that way, the world seems out of sight; and our early steps into those meager lanes, feels both a starting ground, and without much of a future beyond what our passion sees.
            <br>&emsp;Part of the problem is that it is hard to see what something really is. A dating site for instance which charges you 30$ a month is an odd ask, and if it otherwise offers nothing without payment, then this option is subject to those conditions; yet our judgement then under those parameters may not act as our wishes suppose. At least, the restriction may set our use of it as impractical, for the novelty and curisoity of it has no place within that price. And, regarding our writing, it is hard to see beyond the general submission guidlines, and their selective, long waiting process; combined with the unique piece your working on. And my concern, is that to be generous and invovled, comes at to much a cost to real imapct and revelance. Yet, if we are to forgo that as a concern, then writing may not be a thing at all; for we'd just do what we actually want to, and sharing what we have already written seems beside that. For, those words spoken, are really built under this notion that someone would surely want to read them. "I jsut cant picture this reality, where your merritable words leave but stronger impression; and that beasides your select oppertunities to do something precise and grand, that you really just continue to post, as if you were big or small." By that then , the bulk of those posting efforts seem to be the scale we should judge by. For it appears quite nieve to think that even the greatest thing ever said would in fact push the ocean of other things aside. At least, bringing such work to notice feels mightil hard. And at any rate, the way to do so is to build experience elsewhere, and have that be the source of sparks which catch another's eyes.
            I would say, in video terms at least, that if your video gets a 100 views, then it was wortwhile to share. And if it got a 1000 views, then it is worthwhile then to care; and to consider at least what you would do later on, under the expectation that such views profress a future sufficiency. If your audience, or subscibre count was that much, so woudl that suffice as a means for conversation. In a way, were all pointing up at the moon; which is to say that there is this frontier, or space of truth which we are trying to find. And, I think thats why we are so fine alone, and happy when we are engaged; for what matters is in our hand. Yet, only the furthest things really draw that out when your alone, as casual strides are not so enticing alone. And, practically, the point at least is perhaps the reason for said truth, why it is important, and the nature of doing so with excellence yet private; and how, with some relief from folly and developmental ware, that the surroudning elements of your inquiries can in fact be exciting themselves, if not warming and securing for the paces of those higher efforts.

            So short and sweet, we've found our way. Frankly, it settles itslef in the groove of our actual life, which is in some important ways unoccupied, or substantial at least; whereby the private dreams of being known, as if the world were on step further out your door, is gone. By that, our happiness is a remark of me. And theres no need to worry about your own efforts being the objective; and, subscribed, or present, to the common flow of the world. At least, if one is the king of england, or someone of success of prestige, so are the details of that whats important. For they may have experiences that you don't, and many perhaps over time that have brought them to their ends. And at that, the worth of those ends are judged under quality, rather than rose tinted appearences. And at any rate, any amount of genuine success they have, is admired; or, in terms of our own route to success, it is not encouragment were seeking or hacks, but an understanding of how our purpose can be brought out. "Give me the general rules and specific guidlines that will let our particular interest grow." At least, I can say that the outlets for anything more are not occupations themselves, but journeys, ventures, skirmishes. Yet the war of our life is fought on the groundfloor; especially when you consider the real effects of those former, where their loot and plunder would be delivered to that groundfloor. Their objective may seem foreign, prestigous and great, but so are these for select fruits and the nourishment they can bring to our commons. For everyone is living their lives; and be it of a poltician or simple cobbler, all writing, art and impact can do, is nudge someone in slightly different direction. "As if our suggestion grew a favorable result over them." In this, there is much that anyone can say; and there is to be fair much fortune and infamy from doing so. Yet the actual merrit of our ways is in how we spend our own life. For even if others are better'd, so are we privy to our own time; which feeds little on the memories of what we've done. Nor, is a single large entry worth a hundred one's of vibrant thought and care. At the very least, our mightest speeches can't make up for a lack of leisure, industry and care. 
            <br>&emsp;On that note I can say that I am looking for something to do. I see the oppertunity to prioritize our interest in fragmented writings and wordly treatment for our youtube channel -via shorts- while the draw we have of our own writing -and its treatment and care- can be goverend on a platform of its own. A place to put it, out there, able at least to shown or seen; something to stand by, as remarking your interest: which, is to place our writing, having delt it, and understood what we had to say. All doubt or grief over the merrits of this, are out of principle; for the aim of this is not goverend by where we'll go or what we'll recieve, but how we are arranged in task and output. Which, as it were, holds nothing more than addressing whats been said, and refining that as to bring out its content. And, due to our need of this, being from ourself, you need not worry about things your not unfamiliar with; as of course you see less with them; when in fact, our approach, is to become familiar with what were not. And the road to that is withotu hindrance. At least, as the purpose of it is aside from your overall mission and glory, so are we fine to do these because we are pleased. Ease may take in, and our confidence and or curiousty may take us to such oppertunities. But so is this the merrit of all solidity within our life. Which, as it were, hoddles only when it is too subject to those outer flames, deluded into thinking that is where we want to go, when we in fact just want to stop saying no to what we already seek, infront of us in liberal acitivty.

        <div id="forcash">
            Things always bug you indeed. But I find that the real problem, despite being caked in fear of somethig internally daming, is being able to let yourself in, and expereince the product at hand. For all things, be it games or industry, so will time iron things out. "We must only continue."
            <br>&emsp;I see how success, or making money at any rate, is one of competion and caliber. This is different though then doing something for itself, whereby theres an extensive factor which is more readily met. In practice, we have interests, ideas, values; or in other words, we see the world, and merely wish to see it more. OUr privation can cause the doings of others to be poorly recieved, as their flare and promotion rubs against our inactivty. But if we are otherwise occupied, then we can admire what is there, be glad for their successs, and pass on any critiques or disharmony (for us). For we are already made.
            <br>&emsp;In that, the freedom of our paces, brings me to see where our effort could go. In that, I see little which would afford the gradneur of that; which, in essence, brings us outside the harder strides that money and success require. We are just trying to be me, simply, and with some further breadth. Not everyone will care, and views are no strict measure. But if you consider the paradigm of house, bronze, silver and gold, I see that second as a fair target for our highest industry. At least, not much more could be accounted for, in terms of why we did what we did, and how our reception could be given on that basis. Further tiers are ancillarly, as you can only know so many, and collaborate on a certain scale. "Or care at least to some extent, while remaining steady within the subjects."
            <br>&emsp;When we look at the quality of our lives, we realize that most of it is but a garnish, or luxury. Money is fine but in fact adds little to the bulk of our lives. For, it is occupation which settles us, and lets us feel integrated, open and treated. By that, money may give room for more; but in fact, it is for things broader then your common efforts could procurr. And the main point of finace, is that it is a means; and considering the effort required to make it robust, as opposed to sufficient, renders even the largest luxuries a pointless place. For, in practice, the point is that if you could somewhere, it would because somewhere was good to go. And, in terms of flavor, or uniqeuness at any rate, less you merely pass by, and are instead living from place to place, then in each the place the effective properties of it are of its color and form. It is important to remember this, as going somewhere is not substanital in terms of your life less the actual living is gained; which, as it were, is defined by the particular colors on display. Having moved is one thing, but so is this a remark of unoccupation. The point, is that less those are the benefits, than the effort required to afford mere luxury and adventure feels to brief and besides the point. In a way, a life which is treated by the color of the world, is one which is active. In that, there is no limit on how little you should seek besides this; for in those activities, you cannot end how much you throw yourself in. By that,  we can evaluate something based on the worth, in that it would in fact procurr the means to expereince color in its various ways, and not under the burden of something which even makes that favorable. For I see much in this world, and work personally to greet it. Whats leftover leaves room for our perfection to slack, while we incorporate ourselves in more nourishing and steadying things. Were still going you see, as if were already at the edge, and trying to keep up; rather than being made as to begin. At least, what draws you out of yourself is not worthwhile under the notion that anyone really cares, and that you can go past what brought you to this rightehous state. Those means are merely habitual, done without notice, but required no less. You merely have the means to tend your garden as the soil has been tended; but so must it be toiled as need be, and watered at that. Its only as time goes, that those tasks become fair and manageble; and the fruits surpass the value in simply being stable, but abundant.
            <br>&emsp;That is my point about money; that it ought not take an arm and a leg, in either practice or employment; nor, is even the smallest amount of truoble worth any contray sacrifice if the value is not there. Money is not valuabe in its own right. And considering what is valuable, it is fair to see that theres no limit on this. For that is the nature of leisure, industry and care. And as it were, pleasure, purpose and success come from the excessed of those liberties, whereby their common paces make use of our otherwise afforded progress; whereby our ease, solidity and insight, procurrs developments of a more substantial kind. "Whereby we have more hands working on our ship to the moon." Or at any rate, there is the casual side of this, of recuperation, while we privately or coopertively tend the lens to see the world, while we take restorative time to see others, and be seen. Though, this is but a remedy born from the unneccsity of our findings being perfect; or staked on something which is born from folly and doubt (of such liberty).
            <br>&emsp;By that, I see that our common concerns of money, health and understanding, is becoming fairer and fairer, as to procurr not only the strenght and rbeadht of our leisure, craft and care, but also enough for these to settle as points of themselves; whereby we then need no perfect mark to begin, but a consistent pace to continue stairing, and furthering our map of the world; the excitment of which offers its own genuine and whole riches; and at any rate, the recession from that perfection means that our hope is one bonr from our happiness in this liberal way (and its own extent); whereby our contedness comes from our engagement, paired with the just spot in being so, and our arrangment to merely proceed: here, we can take our own time, and spend on warmer invovlenets, as to feel integrated as a breathing man, but also feel secure in our indsutrious way: as the security of being a member of the world keeps me settled in our fortune to already be so. "In that, we have our back to begin; the front of which is more painting; whose end is not but the cramp of our hand, and the fairness of its dissolve."

        <div id="commonway">
            In a nutshell, there is what we do, and our life around. The core of the former brings no longing conquest for the latter. But so is that former not banked on acquriing us relief or vanity from the latter. In this, we are in no need to treat it beyond our judgements; which, as it were, extend to not point past our doing well, as we deem.
            <br>&emsp;Still, our world is in need of regard often, for we can feel unoccupied, and bear down the scutiny, pity and seperation as follows. Simply, we are obliged to our common ways. And, as our efforts have settled, there are meager things near and around me. The details are imoprtant, as we are not looking for further occupation, but remidial tasks that seem oppertune. Working at superstore is all that is. Though, the mobility of working online, or having a skill which you can leverage seems wortwhile. But still, the ease which we profit it from it must make up for the 'work' in it; otherwise, our enjoyment of it can be an ointment to any required development or  employment. I am not clear, as I am on substack for instance, as to what jobs those may be. In terms of the reward and demands, yoga has never struck me. Nor, as it is often suggested, has TSL sparked my interest while I was occupied. For the former, the actual employment seems sparse, in interest at least. Being an instructor is fine, but it isn't something I strive to do; for I don't really feel like I am teaching, but demonstaratin; which lacks any precision or abundance. And, despite being something which an agreeable hue, the actual merrits of its occupation seem but a preferable form of otherwise stationary work. Having credit does have its oppertunites, but only to change the color of our lives, not the pace of it. Even then, the transitions would not be more accpetable than they are right now. On that note, I would bring up the value of being able to move aorund, in that you lose your ability to cultivate friendship and community. Integration is not limited anywhere, but its really for yourself. Admittedly, this nomadic pace is hard to acquire, or invovling at least. And considering the benefit of it, I don't feel so struck by it. If I were given it now then sure, but it still feels like a remedy to the common paces of stationary living; yet the care for this has become more novel than a dream. Still, if we could like more domestically while being mobile that would offer great beneift. But when I consider the comparions between moving around town easily, and otherwise being tied to a rooted post, I see the actual fruits and garments of said life nearly identicial. As it were, the profit of mobility is your freedom to be with yourself, as you can do as you please. Yet, when you consider the benefit and desire to be more communal and secure, so do those advents of mobility and privation whither away. My point is that in our common place, I am not weary about being outside of a station less common; as the desires of the one employed, are not so privy to our occupations and invovlemnets. "At best, they give me the freedom to be me; yet in that, there is not much that our solid self cant find delight, simply, and wholly bent to our dearest ways. From that, our actual interest and needs that foster so, are developed over time and through being open; which our mobility seems to offer an angle to that, but of one which does not remark the real benefit of mobility, which is our own personal activity. And at any rate, travel seems to flatten such development. Or, in short, travel and mobility as in all other pleasurable things are desired and a fortune; but so are the roots of them born from our discontent: the remedy of which comes when we occupy ourselves and invovled our time with that which is near and infront. And those outward ventures either run contrary or have but indifferent or novel impacts. So why worry, or feel less, lost, left out. Our life of living bears witness only to its real end, and the means to such claim."

        <div id="wordssofar">
            So you have the fragments, which compared to our writings, is a piece meal effort. In its case, we look at a subject such as geography, or an essay such as Moral Progress, and we see the various points which strike us, and we treat those specifically. As a form, our means is in tex to speech, as it is project fairly, and of a different, richer and deeper tone; also, on the prolific scale, it is simply easier to have it done through TTS than ourselves. Perhaps we can learn, but the means to do so well and with efficient cost is there. Now, we aren't helbent on the lenght, or dimension mind you, but due to the smaller treatments, it seems that a format more becoming to that is fitting: which is reels. By that, we have the background, our subtitles and audio, all put through the assembly line in premiere. Like we did with our BF shorts, we take the words in the case of writing, script them, convert into audio and make the subtitles, then slot them in with ease. When it comes to visual aids, such as music or a person, so is this fine with passing pictures, sliding them as to add some movement, or anything along those lines. In fact, the imagery and its creation is another part of the script; and so when were talking about charts and maps, so will we need to match our selection of those with the portrait formatt. Or perhaps we can find room for briefer videos of a full format. At any rate, I see this side of things as a place to treat David Hume, or Emerson's Scholar and divinity. Plutarch and Montainge seem obivous, but so is there room for cosmology, the greats, the breadth of craft and devices, and our own sums. Such seems fair. And considering the manageble use of images fit to the portrait -and designed at any rate, simply- so is the real limit of these creations one of words and their audio conversion. That is quite fine in my mind, and easier as we go. And in terms of our own production, we see a day as a place for one; which means that a quarter needs 90. It seems within our reign to make some magnitufe of 20 or so per week, which means that a month can create several more. And, considering efficeincy and the clustering of relevant subjects, so may our efforts condense, into several weeks being produced in one, or half a year being made in 6 weeks. 
            <br>&emsp;On the other side sits our writing efforts. Which, compared to Hume, who we merely wish to define, in our own words we mean to refine. As we have indeed said them; and not one seems unfitting for ourselves and the measure of us. So, in amends, we see a grip and tailor of such work, as to become more acquianted, and in effect smoothing out the roughness and windiness of the entries. In that, there is much. And whereas our fragments is going and needs no reverence for fortune or ends, so are we still prior in our writing output; which is to say, that we do wish to do it, as work and a thing, but in which manner and form, so has our integrity to it not fully settled. Practically, Substack seems our place, as we can organize each chapter, the design is nice, and overall the platform seems kind to our sort, and has accompanying features for future products -ie. podcasts, letters and discussions. In short, it seems a place for us to do our writing; and in that, there is a mixture of promise, oppertunity, confidence and ease. That latter though is the breeze though by which our sails should flow, as our work is our object; with all things other being but moths drawn to our treatment. "But so doth the God of fire seek and act in the flame; only those around, by their natures, will burn, while he at best rakes the coals."
            <br>&emsp;The factors of that object begin with our spring writings, which as a case in point, relish the thought of us giving them some time and care. For, you see, at least what I know and continue to live as though relevant, is born from these thoughts; and returning to them as to make them new and mine, gives us leeway to offer them as our sign, for they are better made: and no matter who feels such sparks, so are with free on approach, for our confidence is born from us being clear and happy in what we say. Following these roots is our Poem, which finly details the origins of reproach, and the limit which follows. This section holds our winter writings and its aspects of history, then the time in Vancouver and its sprouting of joy, followed by the formalities of our nature and aims. Rounding out comes after, and holds a mighty slew of objectives, dear thinking, along with solid theological and absolute regard. Near Light centers all of this, with ostentation and division marbling those early thoughts, along with our sentiment of man as a subject, by which the heat on our hand affords a response no different than the peace of our mind. Warm Winters may combine with that prior section as it is much looser than most sections; though there are some fine works such as the Manor, Letter to a friend. And, perhaps when we consider the treatment we'd give and familiarity we'd bear, so might the pieces of these realm be most deserving. For they are in fact the most casual in their elaborative degree, and by that can make use of a tigthening. Beyond, remarks our strongest paces, as we convey the meaning of Art, and how it is no different than our nresponse to a breaking twig; whereas, to remove idlenss and its regrets, so do we gaze to postivie things, but therein draw an equally needed response -but of liberty. We also mention death, nothing, subjects and the otherwise settled nature of our lives. Past this, there is much personal thought, which aside from our memoroy of it, has much material and color to be helmed. "And thats what I say to most things, that if theres something there, grab hold, smooth its edges, better its structure and the means in which its heart is expressed, and our life will be fine. For that is what I'd like most to do. And comparing this to our fragments, in that, I already like, as I've done, where there are no questions: and our substack can be the binding means to reach the same."

        <div id="muckofthepast">
            Life seems to always be progressing; better yet, it goes through cycles, be it weekly, monthyl, yearly: even the beginnings of a new life beyond the one live so far. 
            <br>&emsp;And I must admitt that I struggle to make constant reroutes based on prior cycles. Perhaps, this is due to us making amends so quickly, that if a current cycle lacks emphasis of some lesson or rule I care not, for we will go on to the next. Or, at any rate, we make grand changes every period or so, that the permanence of these lays roots for the minor developments to come and go as they please.
            <br>&emsp;Generally, the cause of this near term shuffles is due to an overall lacking in our deepest end. By that, I know not what makes me important; and that if I truly went were I sought to, and in effect was myself, then there'd seemingly be no one: at least we'd all be apart. In that, I see so little of who I am; for all things other seem to be elsewhere. But that is no indictment to something poor, but rather a settlement outside what was once common; and letting that come to life in its own wild way: be it amongst familiar aspects, or in its own frontier.
            <br>&emsp;I see how our desires and aversions are all amuck, or constrained at least under what we truly seek. But, in our lack of clarity and strenght to see and admitt such things, we find ourselves hesitant to go that way: whereby we'd then bring that to life. For, it seems true that out of fear, you may not go where you want; but in that, you tend to run in spot, or grind against alternatives -making little progrss. This is the real problem, in that our inability to see and affirm our aims, we struggle with being where we want, if only well directed.
            <br>&emsp;Near the root of this is our regards to travel. Or, in a broader sense, what compells me, and the shades and complexion of things which draw our steps and development. Simply, the colors of nature are what spark my eye. The layout of the land, its glare from the sun and moon, the sky floating above with all its clouds and texture. Even the plainest elements of roads, paths and trees: these all delight me. Or, in short, they are the elements which bear relevance. If I went to Egypt, I would notice the vista and its relation to the Pyramids: I would care little for them in and of themselves. I don't have a brochure in my mind which longs for or is giddy towards the cultural milestones abroad. Rather, all cities are on land, and as such are subject to the textures and shades of that land. Which, in a way, affords me the ripe efficiency of finding all in all things, novel; for there is not much in such domain, which isn't present everywhere. No where lacks the sun, or moon, or sky, or land for that matter and its molding of such vibrance and shades. Going to some far place is nice, but its only treatment is a different mixture of those elements. Sure, some places have different spices, i.e, the desert, jungle, aurora, the sea even. But I would not go to Italy simply for the pizza, nor France for baguettes. At least, this would be an expensive venture for something so trivial. That is, something so short lived and novel. "For, if you said that you wanted the prescence of those foods in your life -in all their purest cuisine- then I would retort, with the fact that you are only visiting, and briefly I presume: so which prescence is that? A relationship would not hold up if it were onnly so: yet, of such relations, the best things are judged by: at least, the quality of our life is judged on the relationships we have. Which, in effect, bears little merrit to superior moments and off handed experiences, as no relation is had."
            <br>&emsp;What I want then is of the kind which is liberal. Namely, to treat the Greats, color the stars, cement our mind (and learn it), and otherwise progress in our limited ways, with a firmness and ease, as to carve out a true experience which acclimitzes itself as the end, but in that bears more clarity for benefits and means. That is a gradual life, born from the back, whereby we affirm the attraction of all puruits and contentment.
            <br>&emsp;And this does seem to be fair, and enrichening to say the least. Yet, its pace is not always so; and, althoug there is much which can furnish our kind of way, so are clear on where such ends are headed: at least, where we are to be, what we are meant for, what we can expect, hope for, wish for, work towards, anticipate and otherwise know to see: in our time, on our land, in this world, 'outside the realm of not'.

        <div id="tiltofman">
            Something which always tags behind me is this sense of contribution; which itself comes from a mix of stasifaction from dreaming of so, and seeing our means to do so. But, I think that this can get too carried away; not only in your antiicaptions, whereby the reward for being helpful is deemd. But also, in feeling poor when your time tends to yourself, and has little edge or bend to those impactfull ends. By that, the symptom comes when our personal time is sluggish, fairly lets say; but you feel this need to prove yourself, and otherwise feel exiled under the false efforts of your way. This is more a reflection of whether or not your happy, which itself has no solid bound. But still, let us remove this notion that we are a savior, or anyone for that matter. When it comes to climate change, asteroids, clean energy and even things of the polis, there are thousands (of a high count) of reserachers, service men, engineers, public servents and all things between, who are employed by a bevy of governments around the world to treat the slips and knots of the world. The common man, sweeps his alloted street, or waits on those nearby; while these specialists solve particular problems. In that, you may equally specialize, or otherwise mingle with the labors and affairs of common people. 
            <br>&emsp;From this though, a pernicious sentiment of education arrives. Not in a kid going to school to learn grammar, but those who seek to enlighten folks to the ways of the government, the issues of the world: the journalists if you will. Or even those simply trying to foster community; for the sake of women's health for instance, or some local concern within a town. This is a diffiuclt action to place. For those invovled are not the electies themselves, or specialists; nor are they so personal within their normal paces. I would say that these peopel are ordinary, but like a hobby or craft, seek to make a difference; at least, the involved themselves in discourse, leadership, community and perhaps fun. The reason may be that there upset, or that their drawn to something with purpose; which, it seems, joins their civil standing with the leisure of such ways, and how things of a meaningfull sort are but more wholesome kinds of pleasure -or acitivites at least which they are free to do. Most spexialists, outside their common similirarites, are not impacting the world in such ways as normal citizens. There improving the water supply, the means of organizing files for the sake of law and commerce; or their gathering intelligenc, and establishing the devices to do so. In that, it is worth noting that these speciilaize folk can be of a developing or servicing sort; as in those who engigneer aircraft carriers, those who fly, and those who use the equipment delivered. These are not coooks though, nor teachers even and secretaries. There in the field so to speak.
            <br>&emsp;And so for me, I can remark how all things come to be by the shared whole which all stands on; but that each knot and bind really comes at those points; and how these engagments are nothing but natural. In that, there is no guarentee of seomthing happening. Instead, the factors which compoound to produce a speicfic end (or alltercation), is only whats worth regard. This is hard to due though, as one cannot fairly generalize all aspects of the world. Still, we should have some reproach then in our attempt to do so, or at least round ourselves out as we can. Otherwise, we can attest to the small density of issues, despite their significance in the smallest amount.
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps we are doing the right thing then. For the world is in no dire straits, at least in any natural way, and what someone speicfic can do. "There seems to be so many points addreswed, and so many nudging." I'm fine then to nudge or own civil repsonsabilitites, and leave the frame to those specializewd for that. At least, less we pick a point and equally prioiritize, then the resolve is with scrutiny of a whim. 
            <br>&emsp;In our case though, our attempt to be more broad in our civility is far away as it is grand. So by that we'll take the natural appraoch; for our humors, passions and irritations are no reputable factor to be driven by -in our draw to such public matters.

        <div id="farandgreen">
            So in the year 2414, the space administraton sent 15 vessels to reach to range of stars. Each vessel held families and members, each within their respective groups (per ship) as familiarity had bore them while on Earth. The advent of propulsion had not reached anything akin to lightspeed, but the veolicities reached were of a tremendous rate. 
            <br>&emsp;Our solar system is housed in a bubble; which like most classes of things -ie. galaxy, bubble, group- ours was merely the local one. That bubble held some stars, but together, drifted with other groups on whats called the radcliffe arm; which itself, was a little knick in the perseus sprout of the orion arm -which was one of the main branches of the galaxy. Obviously, the resolve of this operation was not to reach far into the galactic realm, but instead find worlds that were able to support the industry of man. 
            <br>&emsp;The world's economy at this point had levelled off to what it was in modern times, as technology and ethics had caught up and begun to outpace the bellies and loins of people. In that, there was room to invest a great sum into this space-expidition. The goal, simply, was to land these settlers on their respective planets, and allow them to be. As it were, the means for transport was in something akin to cryo-sleep, while the vessel was managed via computing. Due to the propulsive nature of the trip, only 100 light years could be travelled within 60-70 years -as some regions of space varied in molecular density. By that, the motion of this expidition was one akin to the first long range craft of man, Voyager. As that was meant to merely go and drift away, so were these settlers. The realities of this held conseqeunces which were merely logistical; and considering the centralized plan which the administration eventually sought, so was it impractical to consider outside the grandest time span. by that, a more intricate detachment would be sent, where a real establisment would be placed out in this new community of settlements. Communication was never so limited, but transportaion was. By that, the virtues required for each vessel and team had to be self sufficient for a great deal of time. At any rate, as time would go on, limited only by food and the community which fostered it, the rotation of centuries did call for additional supplies and converse between the colonies and the central hub. While the colonies had means to support themselves, their engineering and manufacturing potential was on a smaller scale. The central hub however, held mightier means, and could serve as an actual soucre and provider of improved tech, and overall supplies. As it were, most of the colonies remained close to 100 people, growing to severla hundred over the first stretches of time. But, it was not unrealistic to expect that as millenia went on, that these numbers would expand, and would thus require further infastrucutr.
            <br>&emsp;The core mean to this is in elemental recygcling. Whereby, something akin to carbon fibre and other selected polymers, allowed for the molds of life to be harnessed, and thus employed for an efficient means of production. By that, the contents of the atmospehre could be converted to water and oxygen, or the material in the ground could be fertilized for the use of agriculture. The colonies each had their means to achieve this for there personal groups, while the central hub held means to supporting a civilization. "Though its objective was not to grow a population into the millions; its goal none the less was to make use of its broader assortment of tools and tech, as to make an excess of supplies that could re-supply the colonines per century, and otherwise permitt further expansions and (population) growth." As it were, the central hub had no means to produce the vessels which would launch from earth. That is something which would have to later arrive, or take centuries to develop as the hub was established. So, for now, the current millenia was focused on the current colonies, and the central hub rooting itself in as the adminsitrivative center for this galactic part of the neighborhood. From there, further expiditions could be made. At any rate, some of the vessels are still travelling to their destination, while those which have landed have done so after centuries of travel. The central hub has only just been established. And as it were, our plans for the eons ahead, marks little care for the everyday happenings of people in these new localles.

            As it stands, the initial vessels launched in 2414. Each could go a speed of nearly three quarters lightspeed; but considering the acceleration from launch into coasting, and any density of debris, the effective pace was about 70% LS. In terms of destination, the tools at each ships disposal was such that a certain configuration within the atmosphere and soil would allow for survival to ensue. Upon reaching the front door of their respective planets, they'd refine their topographical view -as the general atmosphere and climate was already known through spectorsopcy. Here, having already assessed the seasonal range of the climates and those respective effects per latitudes, a general area would be scouted, and upon closer look, an actual terriotory would be spotted. Across the board, the aim was of the relatively temperate zones. This wasn't due to the benefit received on earth, as agriculture in these settlements could be garnished internally (without rain or anything of the sort). Instead, it was simply to avoid the extreme heat and cold and the equator and polar regions.
            <br>&emsp;There are many star systems you see, in all directions from earth. But, the general goal was to create an interstellar network. Not one, as mentioned, for quick travel, but something which would allow for millenial sustenacne. In otherwords, if we took a chart and viewed earth at the center, then the settlements which were several hundred light years apart in different difrections, would effecitvley be double from eachother. Moreover, the central hub's objective was to sustain the network for millenia's to come. In that, the viable planets were selected from a similar quadrant. As it were, life wasn't the pre-requisuit, but rather the proper atmosphere and geolgoy which would allow for refurbishment. At the very least, what the tools given to each colony could make use of, set the scale by which suitable localles were judged by. And considering that, many planets within their respective systems were viable. And as it were, along a certain bearing, with a radius of 200ly on each side, out to about 800 to 1200ly, there was on average 2500 systems. Considering the 15 vessels sent and the central core, the room for preferance and particularity was available. As it happened, some planets held liquids akin to water; some, had the beginnings of microbes; though none developed enough to become beyond that. Some however had things akin to grasses; but very few held anything more than that. As far as the earth bound data could tell, there was nothing terrestial -in an animal sense. More planets than you'd expect held fauna, but the annals of their environemnt gave no rise to anything more than that. Some could, and on a few planets there had been indicators of something eukaryotic: but nothing more than that.
            <br>&emsp;Where our story begins is in one of the further outposts,  1123 LY out. The central hub established itself after 980 years of travel -all while the quickest settlements landed at 760. Most, settled after 800, the average being 835. The furthest was actually 1202, but beside it and the one already mentioned, the height of the range for most is near a 1000. One important note, is that although space flight remained propulsive, the speed in which it could be garnered increased to something closer to 85% lightspeed. Seeing as the initial vessels left around 2400, and arrived from 3200 to 3500, the advent of the flight came  some centuries after depature. But, the speed was a bit faster, and by that, closed the gap between the initial settlements and the new arrivals. As it happened, the subseuqent depatures were aimed at filling out the quadrant rooted by the central hub, and to also furnish that hub with more mechanistic means. By that, there was more room and speed to supply the outer settlements. 
            <br>&emsp;In this outer settlement, the vessel landed near the 45 latitidue north. The contintenets were split down the middle with some central isalnding, with water covering the rest of the surface. From our surveying, the sun was nearly 2 billion years old, and the planet not much younger. By that,  the crust had solidifed, housed water in a similar way to earth, but held very litle life. As it happened, there was not enough nitrogen to permitt any microbial growth -or sustained at that. As for each settlement, there was a massive air ventialor, that would output the needed elements in order for the settlers to breath. Through the centuries prior to their leave, an understanding grew that air could be better incorporated if the body's health was of a robust state. By that, certain supplements were constructed to allow this on a basic level. This not only allowed the residents to accliitze to the atmospher at hand, but give more leaway for their refrusbihemtnt to take place. By that, the Mason landed on the coast, some 5 miles out. The group had to wear protective gear while they established their means of teraforming, but used the Mason as a housing unit till then. They set up the initial settlement near the water, and some 6 miles south of a westering range of mountains. This belt of peaks ran from the coast into the mainland nearly 10 miles, before dipping into the eastern flats. From the north, a furthe range stretched in a similar way, though it split off into rocky hills going north east. Flowing south from the north of that, ran the river, which split of between the two ranges into a fjord that connected to the sea, while the other branch continued throug through the ravines and cravecas -where the northernmost belt split off into the hils. Ths brnach of the river came south, and bent west to run right at the foot of the nearest range. In a similar way, a smaller river came from the east, flowing along the foot of the easter part of the range, joining with the major brach of the river. A small stream also split from the junction, and ran south, some mile or two east of the main vessel. 
            <br>&emsp;The colonies each had 5 years of food supply. Water was less so, but the means to acquire were also easier than establishing the means for food. Generally, the prime spots for landing were in flat plains. Here, it would be easy to ingrain the land with irrigated soil. Through conversion, soil would be created and infused into the ground. Then felicity of it would take time to settle, and the actual harvest would have to establish. Still, this was not the only mechanism. If there were certain properties to the environemt, then an internal greenhouse system could be made, which itself removed any concern for UV rays and the quality of the planet's ground. It was not bad taste though for a group to ellect to instill new fauna, be it grass or trees. Which, although not always available due to the limits of the enviornemnt, cuold be manufatured with excess resources, or otherwise stablizied amongst the properties that the planet had. On echo2, being a water planet, the content's the atmospher were such that some grass could grow. The soil was the limiting factor, and seeds obviously had to be introduced, but these were managebal tasks. "As water was usually the limiting factor for growing new plants." Generally the land was flat, but did have a slight downward grade to the north. From the spot of the Mason, all the mountains to the north could be seen. Near the stream that ran further south, there was a small rise , creating a bank of sorts, with a similarly flat area as that around it. From here, you could see th sun rise from 100 miles east. And watching the main belt run to the east, the great horn could be seen. Whereby the norther hills met the cap of the lower range, and peaked into a mighty edge. One of the wonderfull things about this planet was that due to its relatively small size, the prescence of water and the more or less temperate zone they were in, meant that the rims of the mountians would accumulate snow; which in the morning gave the Horn a great burnt nose. While the clump of moutains straight north, had a medley of mighty peaks, that generally stayed snow covered year round. Be it under the moonlight, as the sun set or rose, the land was vast and pretty. Better yet, there was very litte obstruction. As the land was quite flat -besides that plate further towards the junction- and thus from your front door you could look out and the see the great horn. The land to the south did admittedly dip slightly, and bundled off into rough hills; but in terms of localle, the essentials were that it was flat, arrible, and otherwise garnished with an atmospehre that could direcrly provide or be conferted into mateiral. The mountains north of us were at best a dressing to our survival. "And the southlands, and admittedly those further east, held their own agendas." Though, some of the initiual scans showed an arrid land further south. "As it happened, this was a crystal desert. In the middle, sat a piece of a broken star, weighing so much that it caused the land to sink. Because this happened from outside the normal geology of the land, the crust former around this, causing a myiriad of hills and flats to form. And in this collusion, the heat and presure caused huge crystals to form, portruding out of the ground. Some are said to reach 40ft tall."

        <div id="meagerends">
            Generally, the administrtation was an extension of NASA. As the world grew into a more stable modernity, efforts of all sorts begain to sprout. Not only was technology furthered across the board, but in terms of projects to. Africa was cleaned up relatively, as were advances in medicine made that made the world shine. All these changes though came from the culture evening out. As it were, the past has always been in conflict with the divine influence of relgion, and the contrasting civility and its requisites of engineering and governance. The former alawys capped this, for the heart of everyone's neighbor was either principally different, or of something that was but personal; or at any rate, the two same protestants could both be protestants, and accepted eachother as so, but for each there was a lack of worldy matters; and so from a lack of prominence in such civility, there was no communion simply by its lack. In other words, religion caused friction or non-civil priority. The world has been urbanizing though through the latter part of the millenia, and industrializing at that. And just as there is the proletariot-working class, so are their clergy, and religious complexions of civility at that. But the governance is much more judicial in a worldy way, as opposed to being ecclesiastic. The details are not so thin as to be frank, but simply the outcrop of liberty was one where the momentum of conflict from eosn ago, held polticial sway in terms of the century or two to come. And in russia and china for instance, their advents were of dealing with a population and its massiveness, all while maintaing control. There isn't two pieces to put together, one being religion and the other being peace and propersity of nations. They are important elements though. In our future era, the world holds no principle bearing, as religion is but an elective. No government reduces its spending on HIV or any of its factors regarding birth control, despite the contraierty to relgion. By that, simply, the world has become more natural. Only, the lack of religion hasn't been replaced with anything else; which in effect leads to avarice, gluttony, rascability and shame. The information era highlights this, as everyone is worn down by their impulsiveness; which itself is favilitated by the indirect medium (being digital). The merrit of this way though is one of increased mobility and pleasure in work, along with meaning and connection in those efforts, and one's of a liberal kind. As it were, the farce which is old media, was gradually reproached from by the citizens of the world. Who, as one who win's the lottery, had either spent all their winnings, or otherwise been drenched with retched colors by frivolous spending. The elements of sickness and death, family and relations, and our otherwise self regard and happiness, never left; and as one who outgrows their youthfull drinking, as even its comfort and fun begins to flatten as the negativie aspects build up, so was the folly side of modernity removed from: and simply would simply be. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, people sunk into the nature of their world, which wasn't one that held nuclear warheads over their head, nor was an asteroid seen or likely. Climate change became unburdened by faint narratives, and was understood as something which would effect things resonantly; or otherwise concentrate into events comprable to one's alreaady present. The severity would increase in some regards, but for the most part the world would move one. At least we would have that sense, that inefficency of things and local disasters was the consequence. Which nuclear war was seen similarly; as removing any narrative, one realized that not only would a 100 bombs not be dropped, as no one had the desire or belief that such act would bear profit; but so to, in this most extreme case, would the majority of people not be hit, and otherwise work through the post-war world. Another notion is in regards to tech. Firstly, the singularity could not be achieved. Things akin to it would come up, and robotics did not lack any senmblence of uncannyess. But not for some time could a machine ponder: as it only responded in what it knows. Then, regarding transformism, the replication was never an issue, and always held much promise in its course; only, the product of such technology was one of replication, whereby the entity of one's mind was merely remade; but, as a subject or agent, there was merely made a new one. And much time had to go by before such a recreation could even produce a comparable agent. But simply, my mind being reconfigured, was so that the body I was in was removed; which again, changes the mind as it is housed in a new vessel. But the point, and something that was never misunderstood, was that there was a person who had to either die, or stay while their mind was replicated. They did not go; even if there was one making the same thoughts. "It would be as if you took off your arm, gave it to another, then supposed that the experience of that arm would be felt in your own body." In short, there is a fallacy in thinking that reconfiguring your mind, while dissolving what you already had, will create a continuing experience for the patient. Posterity and immortality of sorts was their gain, but only as a child offers, rather than an expereince itself. Secondly, in brieft, despite the minscule experiemns that could re-produce the effects known as lightspeed or space travel (ie. wormholing), no progress was made, or seemd to be eligble -bv virtue of removing our fancy- that one could take an apple, and have it move in such a way while retaining its form. At best, it seems, the meoldy of particles bundled in the appple, would be torn to bits. Again, it was not outside of experiement to transport an electron, or some element of the quantum field. But identifying every electron individullay (in the apple) simply felt outside of the realm of possibility. At the very least, the common course of man was such that refinements were always made. But just as the sun has always been what we rotate around, and the virtue of a telescope can then see so much more, so has everything which man's produced, been one of telocommunications, measuring technqiues, and otherwise civil application and engineering. I'd put it like this. One's vision is no phenomena, as is your heartbeat nothing more than the muscles of your heart pumping blood through your arteries and veins. Your speech is similar. Only, in its case, the vocals and their output from the vocal cords, is normal and clear. Only, the actual sentiemnt of speech and its source, which like all things comes down to the notion of mind. In this though, the edge of natural sensibility was reached, and onnly our limnits of vocabularly held us from identifying the elements of this. Doing so though increasingly, led to a natural view of the world, whereby intervention was removed, and the common ends of rest was ingrained. By that, our boyish and head down view was replaced with the merrits of doubt, suspciion, and inquiry; all perfomred through informal prose. Which is to say, that although assesments were made of an increasingly exact kind, so were their descirpiton, identities and meanings discerend with a more wholesome and robuts mentality. By that, the notion of transporting an object while keeping it so, was reproache from, along with the singularity, machines, asteroids, climate, and war. Things keep going on, and only in small screen narratives do the birds and bees stop singing, and everything is placed on a stage. This is reality though, and as far as its come, so its mass and grandeur experienced over the next thousand days, and so forth. Even if all these things come, the meaning remains that the core elements of our life stay. And, at any rate, just as there are millions of people who die from Diarahhea and Aids, without and common notice, so would a world war amidst the additioanl hells of global warming, keep your compartively better (and tended) view to the scene of yourself and those core elements. Which again, may be striclty subject to these affairs; but to that kid living in south Argentina, where no bombs or conlifct are nearby, so is the street he's on, his shift at work, his meal, arguments and repriece from his mother, and his otherwise principle content, is his bearing, his load. And if its an asteroid, well, we could see it coming decades prior; and when that would happen from now, we would have already been privy to the natural way: whereby the rest we were sentenced to, merely came sooner and through novel means.
        </div>
        <div id="thegoodlife">
            Let us take for granted the aim of a good life. By that, its quality matters more than any fancy or appeal. In effect, our regard should helm itself under the requisites to see and manifest such an end; for if our sight is on those former whims, so will our rewards be so.
            <br>&emsp;By that, it is fair, that in this world of responsability, that we would seek relief, or wonderment at any rate -as to make our duties more charming and soft. When we look however, at the expense required to meet such cravings, we realize that the purpose of our overall life is drained. You see, if we live in the same native land, in a modest home of constant familiarity, it is our mind and its sharpness which determines the shine of our life. When that vessel slows though, and becomes torpid and lagged, so are we stuck with all that we already know. The weather even runs over us, as without the brightest moon or burning sunset red, all feels the same. And, as I have experieneced at any rate, the property which I lack is where I am drawn; to move, see, rest and be delighted. These are all removed from an overcast, or the otherwise retreat of leisure and industry upon my sullen mind. 
            <br>&emsp;It is understandable then that since our ability to remain astute is not fairly constant, that we become somewhat rooted in the consequent expereinced of dullness. Interestingly though, you can contrast the preferred disposition of temperence and felicity, as to remain somewhat taught and ample, whereby the goods of that come more constant; and of a better kind. While, the diposition that rears its head when our vitality is  less so, is one of relief, comfort, worldiness, and, in a word, experieences, purpose, pleasure and oppertunity, that welcomes itself to you, openly, freely, and through the future at hand. In a word, the goods of this disposition are based on what you recieve, in terms of an experience given; while those products of virtue are one whereby your solidity and strenght bear an experience themselves: via generositoy, contribution, inquiry and care. "You put yourself into one, as you, being the instrument, can afford to, and otherwise hold a constancy to such state which remains ample and true to the reservations which preserve so, and otherwise the unwavering favor of such felicitous treats, as not to be distracted or regrettful towards other intrusions or comforts."
            <br>&emsp;So I think of our ability to travel, and whether or not its worth it to achieve. For one, the task at hand is to procurr to means to do it at all; and these notches are best described as the means to affording airfair and rent. The problem, is that less you have no reason to return to your homeland, then your touring will be brought back to such place; as perhaps you still have family, and lack any stance to ignore them. This is expensive then, for you must pay to return, and then go back out their travelling. And the general issue is not the value of being more mobile, as this gives both comfort and delight to all. Its moreso along the lines of the narrow line of work that makes this eligible. For if I worked as I did here in some different place, so would we still be at a post; which doesn't change the value very much, and at any rate keeps me wishing to go somewhere. The thing, is that if we were free to go on a whim, so would our means to do so have to reflect that. And as it were, the only means to do this is when you can take your buisness with you. One could be a merchant, and otherwise find more means to move around and settle for longer periods. But if you wished to move every few months, then so would there be a pure mobility of your work. I am sure that those of political and mercantile status held this privilage in time's of old, but still, this did not remark their living, but the advent of moving itself. What were talking about is being where we are, having the ability to go when we please, and otherwise settling into our current place with the ease of knwonign that were free to do so. 
            <br>&emsp;Practically though, all the means to achieving this are through some scheme. For one may have a traditionall job, or appraoch at least, but foster so online. Yet, the actual development of this is no short affair. More importantly, one must employ themselves in such affair to earn their reward; and generally, these tasks are of a creative sort, and under scrutiny due to the contract nature. By that, one can not have but a fancied skill, even for those who are frugal in their needs; for their ability and reputation must still be enough, that their means to finding work is reliable, and their performance satisfactory. 
            <br>&emsp;The question then, in both training and demonstration, is how much effort or care do you have for employing yourself? In regards to our actual life, our effort is best employed along liberal ends. But in that, there is less being spent on acquiring privilage and fortune. And it isn't like our lively efforts are all-consuming; but they take up a great deal of time, in overall committment at least. The issue then, is that if we wish to develop and trade, and one which is mobile, that the route to this is one that shoulders our current wish for living. That is fine, and most things can be procurred this way. Yet, the actual use of these skills, and the somewhat principle need for them to receive enough effort as to garner our effective ability and consistency, is one that wares against our otherwise liberal load. On top of this though, is making a living through engagment, whereby you make your own work, and earn satiety through other people's attention. This is a purer road, is it really remarks our genuine submissions. Yet, the road here is more gradual, and does not have as many intiaial promises. Moreover, the rate at which you grow, is limited as your efforts are more sincere and personal. The more they contort to some scheme or trend, so will you have an increased pace; but this is not much different from our concern of laborous committment. As I see it, the benefit of content is that you can use it as a hilt and trajectory to make what you really seek; and in a way, that is all I really need. In effect, if I were truly privilaged, it would be that I had the wonders of the world around, while I made what I wanted. And, as a note, content is not just a purer game; but one where the impetus is of care and importance; for you share, are known, collaborate and see. By that, if I had all the luxury in the world, there still would be no one in my liberal regards, besides me. In that, I would still seek to procurr some color and shine around such efforts, if only to improve them in their own rights. This is a genuine buisness then; and my sincerity to it holds no regard for promise or oppertunity under any sign of worry -or need to justify. What I can say however, is that our attention there brings me away from any lingering intent to develop elsewhere. It is true though, that as I occupy myself with the efforts I wish to have, so is my home the world; and the common course of our life, and its place in all that is native and known, breathes much esteem and courage into drifting that way. For we are engaged, and ready to see what is nearby as something bold and coming ahead. "While our slowness sees life much further, which doesn't welcome things which appear similar." 
            <br>&emsp;And so, I have not the means or intention to foster an income that would let me travel the world. Nor am I trying to become famous, a savior, a blessing. We live in a world which is run by civility and governance. And all of this is demonstrated through members and their central nodes. Time ticks one and we too breathe our way; but there is not much which is pertruding that many are not attempting to put back in. And otherwise, our idle aims and whims are merely from that. Or better put, in our good moments we seek the use of them in conjurous ways, in our bad moments. But the latter is not good marker; nor is it a limit to the former; as those are but in need of their own committment, and in a flatter world as your better nature projects. Theres no glamor and glee but in those who are outside themselves. And all I truly seek is what nestles inside me. The knowledge of this is weird though; for I know this, see it, ease from it. Yet, in the times when we are shrunk and distant, so is that outer world the object of my regard. Yet I know theres nothing there, as it is only but an anxious description. What I would say, is that your consistency to felicity and her goods, bring you out into the real world; and that although it is not for such brawn and explorative ways, so is the sun there, with all her color, and the general peace and prosperity around; of which you are part of. And theres not much more than that.  
        </div>
        <div id="holdingon">
            I find that the mass of the world, with all its divisions keeps me from feeling small and overwhelmed. For one, considering the breadth of things, it is not fair for me to assume what actually happens. Not only is the movement of things in one area unknown to any sure degree, but those even further off are more foreign in our particular understanding. Of course we have more sensibility to our native land; and by that, we could extend that frame onto other points of happening. However, the general rules of outside our own front door are not so sharply knonw. And so, although I have good sense about how the world is besides me, so is their little firmness in how I equate that to other localles. And, at any rate, as the norms of those localles differ, so is our reference bare, as to make any comparison.
            <br>&emsp;What I see, is that we are tired. And by that there is a haste to go out and find something; be it politically, literally, pleasurablly, or of integrity: each amidst the world. Yet, that last matter seems the most peculiar. For surley, if I were true and stout, so would our glimmer shine, increasingly. Yet, as an object, this seems false; as the means for such extension is in the procurrment of our bloom, our sprouting. That we would reach something feels more like a natural consequence. Admittedly, when we are slow and idle, our need to clarify the results of those outputs seems more pressing. In a way, our tender pace takes care of it self; incorporating the time behind us, settling into the present, and grasping the future with a happy hand. In that, I need no confirmation: for I easily, and merely see more. By that, there's not much to say.
            <br>&emsp;What I must mention though, is that our actions are almost truly false, when their outcomes are not of a sustaining sort. Because, evidently, I find myself in such a grinding state, whereby the past seems more choppy and in need of remedy, while the present seems both to eager to proceed (and find excitment), and otherwise drip apathetcially into a silent passivity (and all the acompanying indulgence). These generally pair together, and the future is then angled under our stature of angst. Hereby, we act as though our place is one of these dragging and flappy times. In contrast, our good state is one which carries itself, and asks little for what will come, or regrets whats been. While, this state of drudgery, is consistent in a similar way; nor is it lacking our developed ability and regard as to resolve based on the paces and direction so far reached. Only, the composure which we refeence and seem to expect, or at least respect, and thus adhere to and prolong, is within that rigid complexion. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, I tend to notice when this state is whithering, away at least into one of firmer footing. And by that, I see how the future, in partciular, has more rest and solidity in its hopes and cares. Consewuently, I tend to let myself float into that lighter composure, and let our resolve match the tenure of such ends (or their own composure at least). I mention this, because there is a moment when this transition occurs, that I feel a mixture of anticipation and exicmtent for the future ahead, but based on less frigid and hasty means. This is important, for when we are in fact settled into those riper ways, we tend to worry little about the place of our ends, and instead accomadoate our approach under the indifference and ease which such state elicits. Only, I also notice that as the minor steps of this state linger into one's which are a bit to rocky or tense, so do I feel a certain lack of constance, as to meagerly return to that more lushfull pace; where instead, we tend to see a future remedy or affair as a relief, or concern rather, of these slight moments of rigidity: yet in that, theres none. And, as it happens, the resolve of our way seems in conflict; for on one hand, we are naturally stated for a vibrant and livley pace; but in that, there is little which the contrary path of sunkeness and its wish for relief and certainty can find. And my point, is that since this latter path is not one of worth or favor, and that in our preferred way -and our judgement of it being resounding- that there is a consistently evident slip, or tear at least, towards that contrary place of gratuity, so am I keen and accepting to belive that our course along those finer actions, is hollow. At least, somewhat, when you consider that the highest merrit of it, holds no firm standing. Which is, that the good I see and expereince, regularly even, holds little constancy; or over the long term that is. Starting again comes from our general dispostion to this. But so is are the mistakes initially a sign of our path lacking something to begin. At least, if our state of goodness were consistent, this I would judge more favorably, or at least deem unscruitbaly, when comapred to such a state happening only often. If it is so good and favorable, why not wish for and work to achieve it all the time? Naturally, and fairly, there may be limits as you'd expect. Yet, what I suspect, and otherwise doubt beyond this complacency to perfecton, is that what is in fact common and achievable, is past our mere point of regularity.
            <br>&emsp;I presume, that if you were living well, that whatever that meant, would in fact become more ripe in substance, easier to acquire, and continue with more range and consistency. We may in fact always notice room for improvmenet; but it is that evident slip which I am concerned about. For me, I see how a lack of overall purpose and entire knowledge sparks such tears. For, as I submitt, the misteps here are not due to the natural limits of what is otherwise perfect, but rather the apathetic and or complacent allowances, based on our assessment of haviing already done enough, or seeing nothing else to do. In that, a state of idlness occures, and otherwise stillness of life and all other things. This can refer to our dispostion being to pressed to goodness, but in fact holds lingering passions and fears; and as such reveals these when your better actions are completed. "Whereby those poor roots and proclivities hinder your rest." I notice this at least.

        <div id="naturesway">
            So I have this notion, and admittedly it feels ultimate. Though I must reserve myself from expecting a whole definition, for the element in question is not yet identified; and as it were, before my thoughts of such thing, I would prefer an actual description -as to have more meat around the bone.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, the world is good; and this is not so because I can see it, or have the charm to do so. Rather, all things are fair, be it in laws, punishment, violence or calamity. Obviously these are suffocating, and cause such negativie symptoms -be it fear or literal dismemberment. But this is the nature of things bending merely in an awkward way. As it were, the end of our life holds no vicious claim: and by those accounts I rest our limited understanding of how negativity can in fact be, while the nature of things in general remains good. That is, with those mucky edges, so is their end a good one. 
            <br>&emsp;What I notice then, is that virtue is a sort of brace, as to remain appropriate to nature, be it in her postive sides, or enduring her harsher complexion. Which, in short, marks the favorable spin of all this, for principally our ends are good, nor are those which are bad in experience, beyond our capacities to treat. For if were being honest, the infringments of our pleasure and content are really from harsh jurisdiction; which itself is not but momentary for an average member of the realm. Be it in ruthless injury, or simple inconvencience, the principle of life affords us no basis concession to any moment of such negativity; nor, in our time proceeding are we lacking any facultie to deal with it -in fortitude and habitation.
            <br>&emsp;Personally, I see a line, of which the highest model reflects -of a person that is. I cannot fully define it as said, for it needs further description. So, on that, I can convey this simply by saying that if you are well enough, then to the nature of things you will see. By your clarity of things, the principle good remains, all while the liberties of being a citizen are present. Again, harsh treatment or false sentences can occur, nor is their an abscence of civil altercations. But these are like gusts of wind, cracks in the road, the tempests of nature scoarching the lands around. Again, as our discipline, understanding and strenght are overcome, we are but blinded to any otherwise scenic reality; which is to say, that even if our senses are removed, it is but so for a moment; for if it is death your given, so is there nothing but the nature of things; or, if it is an infliction of pain, so do you return to an otherwise painless expanse of reality; and if that infliction was of a disabling kind, so are we formidiable and astute enough to adjust and surpass such shortcoming. 
            <br>&emsp;Simply, we are then acquited from any permanent or continous perril. As, to quote Montainge, "if something is so bad that it brings the former, then the fairness of nature and peace are there; while, the less then fatal prescence of the latter, however severe, holds no overly significant effect; for even if the employment of such severity had you beleiving otherwise, so would reality accomodate you afterwards -which again, in following an actual burn for instance, holds room and time for the provident properties of fortitude and habitability, which is to say that the punishment is gone when the employment of it is over, and you may bear any lingering negativity."
            <br>&emsp;As in all things, it is hard to start from nothing when so little is actually known. It is better to say, that in our own abundance of writing, that this was so due to there being a subject or experience which I was in motion with, and could forgo the furthest extremities to write with. As it were, in these purely ground up remarks, there is a need for a complete picture. For, as it were, the nature of things is truly fine; but that is generally so for the common postivity of it holds me in such according strides, that our remark about negativity is but of a considered one; while now, it seems to be a neccessary portion -because were starting from further back.
            <br>&emsp;Yet, in that, I see the possibility. This is perhaps due to the principal good in death, and how pain is otherwise a deliverence for that, or a temporary experience before the non-injurous side of life is returned to. And, from what I mentioned, the lingering effects of pain have a soft home within our formative faculties. 
            <br>&emsp;By that though, I must blossom these sentiments with mentiones of other properties, as to remark the bracing towards the positive ends of life. By that, the back side of virtue seems to be that which deals with pain. While the front side acclimitzes us to nature's finer complexions. As it were then, I would define life as follows, in that it has a neccessarily positive end, and otherwise holds moments of positivity or pain. Beyond pain, there is discomfort and other lingering negativities: our fortitude and temperance can provide. While, times which are idle or otherwise anxiety enducing, so can our composure and briskness fair. And as I personally see it, life is split heavily onto that positive end; at least in our liberal democracies of the modern age, we are more privy to mere moments of pain, stretches of neccessary effort and toil; and otherwise, are subject to a world of wonder and time of rest and delight -and all the alignments such goods require. Now, in older times, when despots reigned, so were the moments of pain more sever in some instances; and perhaps overall the toil required of man was more brittle and prolonged; and at any rate, the lingering effects of real severity, was in fact harsher and longer. Still, the scale of life remains, and its altered balances merely alters the strain on our same faculties. And, as the worst of pains still sees us return to good, so is there a similar limit of generally worse times; for even slaves are privy to the goodness of death, nor lacking any of the surrounding positivity to their confined position. I will speak more about various instances following our definintion, but generally the model is but re-angled, regardless of case. So our definition remains fair in  being non specific.
        </div>
        <div id="4sides">
            Our model has four elements. One, is pain, which is to say that punishment, civil allturcations, accidents or misfortune smear your day; two, is toil, as in the work of a farmer, the patience of a parent, or the general effort required to meet our neccessities; three regards benefits, which generally are of frivilous kinds, in that they are but fancied and unimpactful, or novel, in that their good is only temporary; these can come in various forms, but generally, we look at the value of things to determine their benefit, rather than seeing something such as a larger home as greatly beneficial, when in fact its benefits are equally novel, only perhaps in larger amounts; then four, is activity, which regards our moving delights and pleasure, and in esscence hankers itself on our skill and prudence in such efforts and their execution, along with our actual piety to such briskfull and living ends, whereby the fear of pain, concern of toil and shame of missing benefits fails at tarnishing your content and joy in leisure, industry and care; that is all to say, that our dispostion of activity is equally born of excess as benefit, but more felicitious and mature in its erection and dispostion, while benefits generally remark youthfull whims, grown up confidence, and otherwise futile remedies and comforts of those lower elements of pain and toil.
        </div>
        <div id="theeasethatsbeen">
            The most curious thing about life is in terms of its balance between positive and negitive. For, generally, all ends up the same, so even the most pitched negativity holds no lasting reign. But still, even the most positvely bent world still needs an employment of intelligence; as it were, if the pain and toil of the world were so sparse and uncommon, that benefits even held no regard, then so would the means for identifiyng positive things, amending to them and enjoying them, require their own methods and itinerary. As I see it, our nature is one, in a bodily sense at least, and thus one which is subject to the roots of pain, whereby we've come from times which were not so privy to absolute positivity. And considering how modernity is really a regulation of civility and manners as to avoid unnecessary pain and toil, so is the regulation of leisure, industry and care a novel development. For we have had no tradition or support in prioritizing such things. Fundementally, there is no excuse in the strictest sense, for even those who farmed in ancient Babylon, could still employ their speculative sense; as they would use fortidue to endure the toil of their employments, so could they demonstrate virtue in such a way as to reproach from spending their excess' on benefits, but activity instead. And you might say, "activity, what are you talking about; this is a farmer were talking about 4000 years ago, what activity do you mean?" And my simple reply, is that although they may be subject to monarchs, and tyrants at that, and although there efficiency in meeting their needs is still one rooted in toil, that any spare moment or pace, need not be spent on acquiring more than their toil was already meant for, nor are they in lack of things to invovle themselves in, despite their ancient ways; for the stars were present for those in the stone age, nor was self regard and inquiry an  inaccessible thing; and even if expressing such curisoitiyes was deemed sacrilege, so could the common devotion to God be done through the gratitude of the beauties and delights sprung around the farmland. "Be it the wind blowing through the grass, the snow capped moutntain far about, or the moon lightihg our night, so is there always present for even the basest person to engage in." Benefits employ them otherwise, while toil and pain are but limits on our content; while the gaze onto the world and her positive shades, is for those with such content, and steadily at that. But these are the annals of man. As agriculture came from reason and skill, and the laws, commerce and technology that had room to follow, so have our minds become free as tigers and starvation ceded their consistency. Not to mention that the heart of civilized men is that of religion; which is to say that beyond these pastural ways, that the stability within that bore us the concern and amends towards our time after life. Yet, in that, also came inquiry, amongst other things. And to my point, so would the paces of life which accomdated, or facilitated at least, those inquisitive and or devoted ends, also foster the common and accessible means to appreciate the stars: or at least reflect on the libertys of such a life that bore the time and ease to do so.
            <br>&emsp;My point then, is that although the civilized world has several thousand years of history, and that its ultimate product is one of freedom, but initial, so am I unconvinced that in those ancient times that were was any fundementall limit regarding the thing which is wortwhile in the freedom's  we have now. There is admittedly less toil, nor risk of pain as in those times. But in regards to activity, depsite the current means of its breadth (and oppertunity), the orientation still remains. And personally, I see the lack of discourse and enlightenment which caused the world to reach the point of freedom that is has now, as being so due to lacking what the freedom now  given requires, in that we are in fact proper to employ for positivity. Not to get sidetracked, but considering what led to society, and how the unfounded fruits of those primitive ways burrowed their way into the heart of those ancient, I can only say that the freedom we had to birth such proclivitie was a remark of our freedom being used wrong. For it is in inquiry and grace that we should proceed if liberty has given us such a pace; yet, in those primitive and ancient ways, the fear of things bent our ends as so; for we could not relish the stars and wonder; instead, the innate fear of pain had us contort the meaning of such findings into something consequential; and such a mistake marks the story of society so far. That is all conjectural for sure; but I just don't see any strong reason to feel so privilaged in our current time; when in fact, their is but an appreciated breadth in which our right amends can proceed; only, in comparison to those odler ways, I believe that the means to do the rihgt thing then, merely lacked the space, but not any absolute ability. By that, I make the main critique of society, in that it foolishy reduced the means to act approprtialye to the freedom they had. It is true that their best means would not match our own; but so would the sharpest and finest paces be best in any assortment of ways. Now, we are evidently open to be, and without effective hassle. Yet the problem remains, so much as the quality of our life is concerned; which is that we surpass any unfounded fear of pain and toil; and helm ourselves otherwise to look past novel benefits, and employ ourselves towards those ends which treat us with more sincere prospeties, ie, joy, rest, felicity, regularity, sense, solidarity.

        <div id="injurouspath">
            It seems, what we are to talk about, is how the world is in fact bent regarding its preferred vs negitive ends. Simply, pain is administered through violence or accidents. At least, we can say that for the former, that corporal punishment is excuted or punished, theres a civil alltercation (e.g, robbery or assault), or giving birth (as this is a sort of violence). Accidents on the other hand are less vile and begrieving, for by their nature they simply happen. Their effect can be mitigated somewhat, but the cause is almost certaintly out of your control. Calamities are like this, in that no malice is employed during a storm or forest fire; rather the breeze simply went our way. Trips and falls are similar, in that no one is to blame, except the mismatch of your feet and the ground. Then, there is vehicular accidents, whereby the otherwise normal and welcomed affair of driving or operating something, become's injurous. Even if negligence is invovled, its still an accident.
            <br>&emsp;An interesting point is that when we compare the modern world to that of old, we can see how the oitmnets for pain are more accessible, all while less pain is administered. As it were, despot governments were more common in the past; and as such, baseless sentences and harsher punishments were employed. In comparsion, our liberal states are such that even those who are plainly guilty, still recieve custom and rights, as a citizen and litigant. Moreover, it is more likely that their crime will receive them more humane punishments. Moreover, if in an older time someone was mutilated as a punishment, I suspect that their use of such disability was harder than it would be in the present; nor would there be as many finacial possibilites for someone in those ages to return to, or make us of in there altered state. The point, is that in a first world democracy, the courts are administered, as are their punishments less barborous. And with medicicines, surgery, govermental aid, and the otherwise warmth and security of the most basic of homes, so do these times feel less severe, and otherwise incorporating and softening of any pain in hand. 
            <br>&emsp;As a quick note, the deployment of soldiers, or persectuors in the case of a pogrom (for instance) seems to me more fitting in the violent side of things, as opposed to an accident. For, if I rob someone and attack them simultaneously with a knife, this is a similar act as that of a soldier. In that, the risk of war is both in the might of artillery, and cavalry to some extent, along with the threat of being bludgeoned, slashed, pierced or beaten. Regarding persecutions, the fighting is generally similar, but in the case of submission, pilliaring or exile, so are these more toilsome, or unfortunate at any rate; and again, not only does the modern world behave differently, but there is more room and means for those subject to such pain and misfortune to deal with it.
            <br>&emsp;Overall, amongst toil, benefit and ease, there lies pain as a sheathe, in that she is possible or likely due to circumstance. Yet, by nature, each person is likely at risk of a moment, and infrequently -as the causes of pain are themselves severe, and thus less common, as fatality either occurs, or the chance fails to again strike. I find this an important fact, or element of our inquiry. For in truth, it seems that toil is the heart of human condition, and what we are to surpass in our liberated ways. Pain is always present, as accidents always happen, as do people naturally give birht, get sick, make mistakes etc. Nor is there a void of crime, or circumstances where people must fight and defend; or at any rate, the possibility of pain can be present, less fear of those judging is disposed too -which itself is a bit of toil born of a looming threat. But consider a town, its central authority, police, servicemen, and the complex of citizenry, in the farmers, maidens, craftmen, merchants and children, and ask yourself how many are in fact robbed, and repeatedly? Or, how many are attacked, or subject to violence outside the chance happening of crime or circumstance of war? And how despotic is the realm around, when the person is not a ptolemic, a rebel, a miscreiant? How many farmers are at such a risk as to merely sow and provide? Compliancy may be required, as in the Soviet Union, and misfortune may arise; but the sentences of pain and destrcution born out by those harsh litigators, seems not so random and saturating; perhaps unreasonable and thus hard to oblige, but still due to some policiy or law, which one can choose to amend. I just wonder if some agrarian community in Ancient Egypt held such fatal ends for the farmers and worksnen, commonly. Surely there is a pernicous elemnt of heresy and maligment of authorities to those out of line; but less these things were there, would a person not be fine? And accidents are accidents indeed, but not required. There is indeed a fallacy that says that becuause something possible or likely has not happened yet, that as time goes it only becomes moresoe; yet this is poor thinking. It is very possible that a large amount of worksmen failed to succumb to severe injury; and that even if they did, that such an instance (or one like it) never happened again. Its true that our painting must account for the inevitable illness' and loss that life holds; but were more or less talking about the paces of our life. As the good which we'd otherwise see is found there. 
            <br>&emsp;And in short, if one lives in an overly litigous time, so is that period one where people are wise to be afraid, and sucumb to the threats of that by being appropriately placed. Or, if the times are more fairly administered, so is one more fair to be open and at ease in their wisdom: but ought wisdom ever wain? Surely such times and their according localles may faciliate more crime and or fighting; but so are these strands of pain which must squirm their way through the whole of our days, or life even. It is quite easy for someone to walk down the main road, and avoid the routes of war. I only mean to say then, that by chance or a tight ministry, one is otherwise fine and subject to the toils of their condition. Which is to say, that one is in fact fine and free, stabily, despite the effort required. Personally, I would describe liberty, as one where no such toil exists; which is not to say that there is no condition, or effort required, but that as a worker the effect is not so burly or weighing as to produce a negitive effect. "In that, the good of doing things in general, descirbes the paces of your neccessary efforts." And while pain removes us from tbe pace's of life, so is that line one which bears us the ground to be; which is itself the point of society. But, I would say, that when the ability to stand is past regard, then you are able to see; and as the trouble in performance loses its burden and discouragment, so are you free to employ yourself liberally. At this point, we reach that predicament, as to whether our excess' are better spent of benefits or activity. But per the model at least, we can say firmly that where those excess' come from is in our dealing with our condition beyond the point of toil. And that such toil, as a mark of our condition, remains as a reality of meeting our condition; yet such demonstration bears us our life to exist as so. And pain, is but a chance reality surrounding this; or otherwise, a perncious and or tricky confinment that one must further work to adhere, in states of authority where governnace is so much employed -e.g, the fascits who beleived that secrecy ought be banned for instance, but for the goal of the state's prosperity.
        </div>
        <div id="hurtandtoil">
            So our model is one where pain sits beneath toil. The issue, simply, is that what is the likelihood of someone being subject to litany and or cruelty, if they in fact follow the law? It is possible that being so obediant runs against their principle; or that in the case of the Soviets who demanded that the harvests be sent in, which due to little coming back put the producer at risk; but so, if they actually obliged and sent the food in, would they be ok. And at that, in the most pernicous of times, if someone fibbed to the authorities regarding a man, and they were keen to be overly scrupulous, so could that man oblige. Perhaps he would still be sentenced and or hurt; but if he obliged, offered his admission and frnakly confessed his time and ways, ought he in the ideal scenario be seen as innocent, or at least be penalized without any misapprehension of doing something worse? Perhaps being supposedly wrong is a crime; but isn't actually being wrong more damning? These are pepculiar aspects, for the law is not one of obediance or not, but awkward judgements of a persecuting kind. Which itself, I'd say, calls on no lesser amount of obediance; but is perhaps inconveniant. 
            <br>&emsp;I'm just thinking within your ordinary tyranny, whether contorting those laws would still see the proper subjects punished. This is anecdotal, as I suspect that the only time when such alignment to the laws failed to prevent punishemtn, is from the malicious whims of those in charge. Which is not to say that even the most litigous auhtorities weren't vicious; but that there malice came about through litiny, as opposed to fancy and whims. 
            <br>&emsp;As we'ved stated, crime is but a chance thing. For in some people's case, a basic mugging is the worst they've ever experienced, or a tavern brawl. Statistically, the majority of people don't experience any severe criminal activity. And in terms of those who do, so is the prevalence for this variable in terms of the scenario. Its a seperate metric, but for compariosn sake you can attest to the homicide rate during the Renassaince, which was at about 500 per million, but then quickly dropped down to 100: averaging out at about 50 in the modern day. Civil crimes such as robbery, assault and things of the less fatal sort, are more than not likely to be more pervasisve, as their natures are not so severe; but so is it likely that a minor percentage of people are subject to these; at least, only a select amount of people demonstrate themselves in that way. At least to any severe extent; as pickpocketers are not the bane of humanity; or at least the bearers of pain. 
            <br>&emsp;Regarding pain in general, it seems that crime is but a chance, and not neccessarily eventual. Accidents are as such, and seem to be worth no pessimissm, but understanding -for their ministry is done without intent, and require thus only our fortitude, and no recompense of fear (from an otherwise assailent). Then, theres the law, and its breadth of leniency and fairness. For one may be asked little and threathed with as much; or they may live in equally fair times, but with the most sever of penalities upon infringements. Times may otherwise be horrid and dreadfull, and likely threatening as the latter, but fairly. While, the worst scenario is where life is retched, and the punishments are given out on whims. "Which causes the desecration to be filled with angst, as beyond the misfortune, theres a storm of litiny and arrest."
            <br>&emsp;It seems that toil is not a symtom of violence or accidents, as these describe moments of injury and pain. Their effects may linger, and as such cause toil, but the act of being punished or hurt is itself beyond experience: as if the duration of pain consumes you, and flattens your ability to be. Toil on the other hand is about your existence being worn out, dragged, heavy and down. What I would say, is that if your in this state, then your not in pain. For none who are tied at the stake expereince weariness or despair during the actual incineration. In a way, pain is the expereince of removal, as if your being broken and dismantled. While toil occures while your body is solid and in place, but is weighed upon: like its sinking. My point, is that if you are in the paces of that latter, then you are privy to the abscence of pain. And by that, as we consider what our toil is reminsicent of, then the survival which it is neccesarily banked on suggests that you are at least achieving that somewhat so. Your ultimate failure may produce pain; as starving may eventually treat you to something akin to being unable to breathe. But so much as your steps are forward, they are reaching a point of stability. And, in addition, as that stability comes easier and with less given by you, then you beging to thrive, and in effect can afford the steps of excess -and their ends of benefit or activity. 
            <br>&emsp;But I must return to this seperation from pain and toil. For one may live in the harshest of socieites, with knifes hovering over their head. So long though as they haven't entered your skull, then you are otherwise doing what your neccesity dictates. And, to be fair, nearly all states have the aim of prosperity; they simply may be ignorant, complacent or mistaken about how to achieve this. But suggesting that bullys and boys run the government, is a fairly bland remark. The point though, is that as your toil is received, then so is your path to life in progress. Now this pesky detail of obediance comes into question. For the toil required may in fact not be sufficeint for what you need; and the hellish rules surrounding you may in fact make such shortcomings intolerable. But so long as you obide by those rules, are you not free to toil? Revolutions and critique, at one's own expense even, seem to come when such freedoms are not enough, be it from handicapping rules or simple falts of the workers means. But can't you see then, that the risk of revolt seems to be past the concern of violence and pain; as those invovled have deemed such a threat as less worrying than remaining in their current place. And so less one deems that the rules must be changed, be it out of reckless frustration or serious concern, so is one free to be in the bounds of those rules, and toil away. At that point, lets say, that they can just provide enough food for their familiy to survive, may they not accept this? Despite the possibility of a better government and state, the risk of fighting for that may lack enough provocation, if in fact their needs are met. If the rules tighten, or become less effective, and one can no longer toil enough to survive, then their life is already forfeit, and they risk the improvment born through revolt. But if their life is not under threat, fundementally, then where is the fear of pain? I'd say it is the chance's of crime or accidents. Or, otherwise, if one's needs are not enough to satisfy them, then the risk of revolt may have enough provokation. In that I won't pass judgement. But whereas a man who cannot feed his family in his best of ways, fairly attempts to solve this; while somone who had those needs met, but sought more -which is itself holds a broad range of elements, of gluttounous and or fair qualitities- so would I desrcibe this as not being overly frugal. Oddly though, Montesquie suggests that frugality, and virtue in general, is the spring of democracy, as everyone loves their society, and tempers their place within it as to permitt equality amongst all memebers. Comparing this to a tyrannt state, where one is in the best of times able to survive off the minimum amount of requied bread, says to me that if frugality were present there, then so would the state appear democatic, or functioning at least. "For my needs are met, and in that I am fine to live as the state pleases. If the former is no longer so, than my obligation to the latter loses my regard; for in the first case, I am only pleased to do as they harshly demand, so long as what I need is in place." Democracy's then and their inherint virtue, seem to offer more than the meagerly amount of required bread -and all this in rubble and rain. But instead, propser evenly and prominently, whereby services, goods, novelty and promise are available. It is perhpas democarcies shortcoming when those invovled bank themseves to much on those accessory goods, and fail to remain virtuous and temperate to the core spring of its provision. But that is all for now.

        <div id="pointofcomparison">
            "Comparison is the thief of joy," says a man, and my reply is "sure, absolutely: but by which scale ought my action's be judged by? Obvivously the sentiment is that someone elses apparent happiness ought not be the gage by which yours is deemed. Yet, what determines your actual happinees? Or, is that even the object in question?"
            <br>&emsp;For me, theres this lack, but of a natural sort. For we are not Kings, nor are we idols and merchants. And the question I think that centeres into the whole our regard, is why those are not the right objects. At least, when we consider what is the proper goal, we can see that those other ones are inferior.
            <br>&emsp;In our early days we measured this by joy and rest. And as this removed uneccessary ambition and future regard, so did the truth of the world bare upon us. By that, we settled on a natural limit; at least by todays accounts, we simply have reproach, as we better define what it even is that were unsure of. From this, we developed the notion of qualities, which simply were meant as scales for judging what the best experience would by. In that, we supposed that the substance of something ought be wholesome and pure, accessible and consistent. A question still lingered though, as if we had to justify why these were proper, and that ceratin actions would fit. In response, we developed the notion of ostentation and that of subjects, whereby the former remarked the view of our world which was in fact incomplete, yet able to be addressed as it 'ostensibly was'; while the elements of that limited view, could be addressed as they effectively seemed. The classic example of this was red and blue, and that for instance if we were watching a video game, then we'd know that the colors were but rearrangments of the inner parts -which were not of red and blue themselves. But, as subjects, we could still address them as so, in how they were ostensively.
            <br>&emsp;THe problem I am now faced with, is despite our upward current, we are not privy to any platform or ground: less we make it ourselves. It is fine to float, and is in someways neccessary, and reflective at least of what is ultimatley important. But, ostensively, we are still drawn, by the moon and sun, the taste of grain and citrus; nor are we absent from toil, and otherwise unprivy to the committment and graces of friendship and community. As a man in what we effectively are, so are there things to do. Only, the best of me, where I shine brightest and expereince the remedy from fear, is in leisure, industry and care, which is mightily hard to define, oblige and share. For, the crux of a man's life is as follows. If he were suffocating, by sense or neccessary movment he'd gasp; and per our intelligence and its development through society, so is our address of sustainability and stability banked on our committments to the system which supports us. And, a man in some sense ought to know what that system means; for their sympathy may be poorly bent; and otherwise, there thoughts may be incomplete and accordingly lack direction as to what they (as a member) are right to do. For you see, throughout all of modernity we have had this tricky question: what do I do with my excess. For just as I feel awry at the removal from the system, and thus pleased and safe when we are appropriately set as to receive what we need, so are also keen the more complimentary pleasures and interests. The feeling of being out of line as to receive those is not so essential or damming, but one which can make us feel begrudging, poor in comparison, left out, frustrated at other's for not being out of line. The treatment of liberty though come's into play, as our theory of ostentation effectively removes any merrit of thinking that nature is intrudable and that our life is judged for the sake of some eternal expereince; nor are we subject to miserable privilage and fortune, at the thought that others are rampantly worse off, when in fact their destiny is to nothing, and otherwise momentary in its pain. "And man ought to really know what likely causes that; as this gives a more solid, yet precise standing for his virtue and sensibility to wrap around; whereby the employment of fortitude against any of pains lingering removes the fear of it happening at all."

        <div id="modeofconquest">
            So I've got a few initial remarks. Simply, the confederacy of the world seems the best modern advent. It is true that the result of this took a worldly toil; but even then, those who spent their lives did so in order for the confederacy's to ban together, into unions (or leagues). By that, there are but a select few nations which operate independantly -notably Russia and China. By these though, their greatest threat is conquest; which in our times seems quite tilted in our favor. Even then, we can respect their aim of preservation; and otherwise criticize alterior motives. At least we can regard the spring of such motives as despotic. 
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, a given conquest may result in the government of the victor acquiring those defeated, all while continuing the laws and customs as they were; or they may change those, or at any rate dismantle the society. To quote Montesquei, "if they proceed further to destroy the people, then they surely must be despots; as the removal of subjects does not neccessitate the removal of man."
            <br>&emsp;On the front end, in our modern excess, there is a fine notion of happiness, in that we'd work from our freedoms as to reach for things far and positive. Only, success still seems part of our tradition, and by that we seem to occupy our liberties on acquiring more, for benefits at least. But I would say that this is not par for the course of happiness: which I would mark as the dearest value. 
            <br>&emsp;Simply, my own happiness is most important, for that of others, our own success and what others can also earn, is born from it. In a way, this is the natural course of things, for others satisfaction with me, and my offer, is what earns me success. And from there, if I have enough success then I may form a company, whereby the happiness of others is further accomadted (in extent and amount); and the neccessary company required bears success to those now invovled. But this all stems from your own happiness. Which, I would say brings more forward the closer you are to it. For, if you are mistaken in your goals that success is most important, then your value offered for that wont be as much if the product is insincere and contrived. For one, theres less consistency in that than there is in something that really pleases you. Nor, is there any dear care from others when the contrivance of your product offers only basic values. "It is the love and care from a baker that makes the best cookies." As it were, a major company may have started with something less loving -as remarked their bend towards success. In that, many may appreicate the product, as the assembly by the company may afford such extent. But I think, in principle, that brand name cookies will never earn any individual memebrs favor as much as they would have for their mother's home made oaties, or that from a lil bakery. In contrast to those pure and scrumptous, is those baser and conveniant. 
            <br>&emsp;You may be saying then, "well of course they'll be happier, as the product is more sublime: but the profit of the company (in all their contrivance) will be more." In that I agree; yet I raise the question of our own values, and whether it is success we seek, or happiness. One may lead to the other, but at the very least, we can say that one is the object -while the other is merely a facilitator. Imagine though, if I had all the money in the world, and decided that the best use of it was purchasing the right equipment: what about the laboroers? Better yet, even if skill was paired within the operations, would character not determine how success was used. For, as its common, our actual employments tend to mold what it is we desire; be it of relief or clarity. For in our labors, we plan and develop as to reach a further point of success, or otherwise soften our wears with liqors and treats. Is that happiness? 
            <br>&emsp;The first rule of philosophy, as pertains to man at least, is that happiness is not measured in contentment, but felicitous activity. And as the objects of success hold require tools and character, so does happiness hold its own. It is not so that the ends of buisness and infamy are happiness; instead, happiness is the end of the activities which procurr it. And while pleasure, comfort and significnace do bear a fair reward, the actual elements which bear these are mixed between frivolity or novelty. While the efforts of leisure, industry and care, reward one which ends which are constant, merry, and pure. 
        </div>
        <div id="settlingpath">
            I don't know what I want. For starters, there's this peculiar focus I have on things of a liberal sort. I refer to that, in the sense that things of a stabilizing or pleasing sort, earn little regard; perhaps because I already have so much, inheriently. And so those things which draw my liberated mind, hold me accountable; despite the fact that they always slip away; for their place is only there when I am. While those elements of comfort and mystery, are more like promises, in which we are right to show up -and thus work towards. 
            <br>&emsp;This is where I struggle. For our efforts don't bring out the latter; and although our time is spent making towards the former, so is the natural inconsistency of that, a drag. For there is so little which my effort seems worthwhile to address besides this. Yet, in that we are our own limit; in that we shed unneccessary expectations from those efforts of leisure and industry; and that when it comes to our consistency, that we would be at least clear on the realities of the alternative, and equally for our own. In that, I see no need to travel, as the time there is either less rewarding than the requirment can offer; or at least the narrow domain of what is actually a beneficiary and or associate to those things of the ripest sort (while travel is more sought from idleness), makes such efforts a detraction from those so dear. Better yet, the elements of the right life, generally afford us the occupation and rest to proceed, without any grievences of our lack of oppertunity; for we see not, for we are invovled; nor do those other impressiosn unsettle us, for we are already moving and satisified. And, at any rate, if I look at our future, and regard it as open to move and be, and perhaps apply ourselves to that, I still don't think that such a life -and its mercantile requirment- is conducive to the goods of a good life. How can you foster relationships or community by moving constantly? Even if your family was gone, so would your interest to move, reflect a life which was solely your own. Yet, in that, I see the limit which procurrs such desire, as coming from your current lack of occupation. This isn't absolute, merely a measure by which our contentment and regard should proceed. For we are doing much, and in terms of those true goods, there is room to acquire (or try at least). The future then seems irrelvant and unlimited when it comes to those fleeing and novel fancies.
            <br>&emsp;In a way, this focus we have is only limited by our ability to attest to it. Comparably, in the early portion of the year it was clear that A) we were reserving ourselves from things we desired in the name of success (via our liberty), and that B) we were accordingly put off because we truly were not as happy. While now, having rectified that to a degree, we care less what others want or care for; in fact, they seldom do, but from time to time ask. Its about how well you are; and when you are not, and questioning your life and in some sense trying to change it from a source which does not afford you such kinds of sought change, you then get closed off, for you struggle with sharing how your peculiar life, doesn't fit within the norms. Admittedly, people have little to offer besdies those norms. But we, personalyl, have integrated ourselves more, and thus can rest and proceed, openly. In that, I can see that there are lingering elements, notably regarding travel and work, that reek of a lack of clarity under this happy lense. For it is not the case that our honesty and assessment has been poor; only though when we did not in fact believe it. Now that we are more content, we can describe our actual interest in travel, and otherwise concern ourselves with what it is, what it means, and the route to do so. Which generally removes any doubts of our reproach from fancy -as we are fine and definitie in hwo it is so. Work is not so different, in that you benefit comes soley through mobility -through mercantile ways. Yet, in that, be it in commerce, trades of care, you are left with the unneccessary benefits from the first two, and the long road of the latter. And by that, the truth in our world is where our happyness limits me; for if we were well off enough to say how things really are, and thus what we are good to be, and equally desired by our own, then we could more rightil amend; in that success did not have any pressing need to be our object. Tasks for sure can be done, along with projects and amends. But, seeing how things really are and what they mean, can really iron out the simple path to happiness, and its objects, when amidst that truth, the elements of the each are what I see. And so within our freedom we can be, happy in and of itself: foresmostly, without falty amends: for our qualities are born from truth: and we thus need very little footnotes regarding our supposed intent otherwise.

        <div id="sparkedapproach">
            So, i feel this brace from others close to me, who in their irriation scorn at our inaction. Yet, for the sake of happiness, the world is not so clear. And at any rate, it seems so hard to occupy ourselves for things which aren't for success; and otherwise, be content with what we have, and rest little on what goods of success we'll earn. I am always footnoting and justifying why happiness is alright, or at least how our happy steps will bear promise.
            <br>&emsp;The issue, is that if we are not sincerely happy, then the desire we have will feel worn upon by others scorn. This isn't entirely fair, as our view of goods and fun is generally furnsished upon our well of dear goods; whereupon our slack in their respect sees us wishing for surrounding flavor. Yet, I still feel, or notice at least, that either as a cause of our slack, or the wish for the best itself, whereby we are not so clear struck and driven by our happiness and its means. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, happiness holds her own objects, as do success and other aims similarly. The thing is, that all things besides happiness are in a way reductive, for they put the subject at the will of something else: which their interest obliges. "Come here and I will care for you," says substance and invovlement; while happiness says, "wow, how great is it to be here and see the world," in which we'd confess our posture being the thing which enlivens us -like we showed up, rather than being greeted and taken care of. 
            <br>&emsp;The problem of philosophy though, is that the descriptions and amends of such happy ends, are not at all defined. You might say that history has gone from a state of closed handed preservation, to state security, to liberty; which can be applied towards benefits via a profession or mercantile trade, or towards the veil of the world which our freedoms have shown, and by that, heed the draw of such things, identifying them, rooting their worth and removing those contrary: to which we glow.
            <br>&emsp;It just seems that our happiness is bent on appropriate action. Yet, the bend of our ways still feel disposed to security and benefits. We seem lucky, or oppertune at least to achieve the latter; nor are the fretting bows at rest while the former is not ardently within our hand. Saying what things are then seems the issue, for we tend to run contrary to those normal ways; but are then exposed to ill definitions of the world; in that we are in fact unhappy and seeking those things, but unable to properly address them or mitigate our fancy, as such objects are undefined.
            <br>&emsp;In a word, happiness is in and of itself. Nor, does life withdraw you from her promise if you aren't travelling or inundated with free time and comfort. And, considering the diligence required to benefit outside the liberties for happiness within the state, so can we see what is actually of worth and means to acquire thorugh moderate efforts within such state. THe point though, is that the regards for that are not out of reassurance or justification. Yet, our need to do so, albeit born upon by the whims of those nearby, comes from the fact that you have comparable sights in mind; and despite their altered view, your frustration comes accordingly, as if you wish for success in a different way; yet, of that kind there is struggle when happiness is also concerned: and by that, neither seem eligble to share. 
            <br>&emsp;However, our description of the world gives us recourse on the nature of things, and otherwise clarity of what we'd choose. We cower not at the thought of not being the King of England; for that position is at least grand enough for us not to see it as obtainable, nor others beleiving we should. Whereas the novelty of touring and travel seems commonly accessible, that our lack of this seems alarming; at least we notice our interest in being mobile as subject to others scorn about us not being able to right now, or working towards it at least. The problem, is that we have no clear and steady definition for travel, in terms of what it means, and its limiting ends. Better yet, if we could state its actual favor, then that small point of comfort which such favor drew, could be a sincere point of promsie for me, and otherwise born against as we sought otherwise, or were simply not privy too. "It just feels like the whole world is not in our hand, less we know what the world is, when others see us doing nothing; whereby we seem to be exempt from nothing. And our aim of happiness has treated us to the world in our dearest ways; to which our lack of definition affords me the incoming impression of being without such extent. Yet, in describing such general ways, the world feels small, and their critiques are either not so present, or not unsettling."
            <br>&emsp;I think I might say then quite frankly what to believe. For one, death is natural, in that we are configurations of matter, by which our senses (and the ambigious tenure of mind) equate. By that, the product which is our thought and care, leaves as the organs which product it dissipate. By that though, the comparable experience of rest, whereby the body has worked well enough to finally turn off, shows us the beauty and preference of nothing: which, by our natural demise and seperation, promises us with an according eternity. Secondly is in regards to governance, and how it is fair so much as we wish for security, and that such interest requires organization. The legislature and execution of such arrangment holds a range of good and bad ends, but so are we twisting a screw with no torque -this does not remark about the merrit of the machine. By that, the government in its worst case holds unwarranted punishemnt, and of a corporal kind. Yet, the entirety of the populace is not subject to them; and generally, the worse threat is one lingering over their head; but so to is that made for submission so that the state's form of preservation can occur. But the law can always be followed, and decency in the worst of times can hold the day. While, those in anything favorable to, need not worry about overt slips. "Nor does death's gift warrant any utmost fear of pain; as such will end, or lead us to nothing and its rest." Thirdly, regards our duty as a man, which as a subject and that relation to the law, merely convides in the frugal use of the liberty received, and the all too simple task of electing those who would serve me. I do have the privelage of existing within the age of science and reason; as to remove any fear of casual torment or tyranny. But too, I can at least attest to the will and governance of those who would provide me with laws, representation, service and protection. 
            <br>&emsp;Culturally, things seem to spring from that, of which we are right to oblige, but within our excess amend. "Hence the American dream; which itself holds the implicit agreement that to bare the advantage of being an American, that one must exist as a citizen and member of America." And of those mentioned, that is our task. 
            <br>&emsp;Reason though does not stop here. For although the laws of warmth and satiety flow from the wells of the state, so is there a goverance appropriate for your heart. For, you see, the pressures which select the laws and state to be as they do, come from our nature as men, and our situation within nature. Which is to say that we must eat, sleep, secure, and otherwise humor the core advance of the species. This dynamic of environment and subject requires walls, along with those who man them. And at least as states are concerned, so are those within such bounds best to respect the custom of how such structure is helmed. From here though, the question becomes one, where the walls have sealed any threat, and that the invoice to the subjects is quickly met, whereby their time and fortune can be elsewhere cared. In that, we have the trickiest question of all: what ought we do with our freedom. For we do understand that such freedom was won, and that by that we mean that not always was excess so abundant, or free to spend. But I do beleive that the principle which our free time employs, is the same for those in chains. "We are merely the lucky ones, to be privy to freedom, and thus consider and explore such frontiers."
            <br>&emsp;At this point there are two core elements, one being the Good Life, and the other a contrast and assimilation between tradition and freedom. For the latter, this marks a reflective take, in that the world were in, with all its fair punishment and service, still holds roots of value born of less free times. And while the veil of dearness has receded, so is our time and means to see it still beholdened to the interests and pressures of older ways. This is a taxing disagreement, for it rests so cleanly on truths which are not concisely knonw. Yet, in our view, death, government and duty, are quite fair and fertile; albeit less so in the ways they are sometimes applied, but principally they are so. And by my accounts, the prevalance of the former has for a long time wained. So I would say we are right to advance upon freedom, and assess the question crucial to that: how ought we, upon a secure offer, live, when the qualitay of that life is whats important -as opposed to the mere prescence of it, or preservation of it rather (or mere existence). "What ought I do when I can plainly and correctly be? When our ability to be is not in doubt, then our mere existence holds no bar, as we are not under threat of confiscation or dismantle." 
            <br>&emsp;In short, I see how the elements of excess have come from our freeing ways. Yet, I believe that our state of modernity is one, where the concerns of security and task, are really bent on the means to obtaining benefit, as opposed to happiness. In other words, if we addressed what was required of us in order to be well off enough in order to advance our well being, then we would see a sizable seperation between what people in fact believe is required. That is the thesis, the trouble, or criticism. I cannot gracefully oblige old ways of being which were infact unbecoming of a true state, and how the annals of that have left both scarrs and impressions, to the effect that people's perceived freedom is not actually so high. But then even, I would say that there is no governing force which is pressuring you to own a large home, and acquire a requisite job. Such desire and occupation are beyond the fairest neccessities of life. And perhaps, the right diagnosis is one which remarks the likely symtpom of a state which offered freedom compared to one which did not, in that one which didn't would see its subject fine with hot water, air conditioning, interent, television, radio, transport, public service, free markets etc. While those in a free state would seek to expand their position, which to my point, is what we see. At least, those not impoverished or marginalized, seem to have their heads pointed at education and training, as to reach the professed means for equity and estates. 
            <br>&emsp;So I sympathize with one, in that they are not free enough to extend themselves; and our feeling is merely altlered by the fact that the quality of their ill freedom is one that satiety, warmth and comfort are not lacking. While those who are advancing themselves, are almost entirely doing so by means of excess. For the novelty of space within a larger home, or the luxury of a nicer looking car, is not at all a priority -by definition at least, when you consider how restricting circumstances would leave such efforts ahead. But in that, you have the point, in whether we have such circumstances: our state. And, if they are not restricting, and are in fact free for the subjects use, then ought our effort amend for the objects of novelty, frivolity, luxury and fame, or should we drench ourselves in the delights and leisure, industry and care; and color ourselves more dearly, plainly and pure? One of the core topics that holds less crucial truth as those of death and duty, is of children. And in that, the good role is one in which you oblige to give, rear and wait. And by that, their is a neccessary down payment, of what you will through the process give. And one of the key qualifiers, or markers rather for you being in the ready state to begin, is that you are the person you'd want your kid to be: in that you could help them reach the same. "And the point is not that they'd be a t-bone steak too, but that of the meat they'd cook, they'd equally know how to season, taste and enjoy: and ought we ourselves have learned and be able to thus teach, that the meat has to rest?" Unless you wish to have your children raised by someone else, or at any rate if you believe that your involvment won't effect them, then who you are upon having them is the kick off for such results. And so reagarding children at least, we can at least attest to the object and manifests of our life, as we would hope our children to advance and produce. "May they achieve more than me surely, but in goals and character of the game of happiness, rather than success."
        </div>
        <div id="ofvirtueandvice">
            For me personally, I feel quite split between virtue and vice. Moreover, it seems that the contempt of others is born from their own vice, and the scrutiny which their scale for judgement pings on me. This is so, for all ends are so if they are positive; yet if there is no end then there is no claim. Vice seems to let our poor tendencies take reign, and become the judge for what we assess and good and pursue. While reproach seems to suggest that our sense can helm better paths, with richer qualities as per the relation to truth. Yet in that, you are not always proceeding, or aimed, with an object. An important note is that I have vices to, or desires at least. And so when others condemn me for not being successfull, despite their poor view of the success I lack, there is still part of me that wishes to have a kind of success. 
            <br>&emsp;Its just not clear on what we ought to do. For we do have roots that make certain things pleasurable. But so is there a world of time, duty and death, that briefly, periodically and ultimately squanders my tasty amends. We can be drawn to something which pleases us now, but so is the truth an iron which evens us out, to the point where those moments of comfort, fair little upon the negativites which our neglagence or gluttony produce. That is the trouble you see, that there are all these incoming causes; and our desired effect is born only so when we are able to rightly oblige. In this sense, the notion of value and contrariety come in. For my time drinking is purely a detriment to our coming labors. But, if we were to enjoy some leisure or conversation in the time following, so would those dulling effects of drink lower that; to which our choice in the matter might lean in avoidnace, as we valued the time with activity and friends. And, to be clear, that because the nature of liqor and its comforts is known, so can we see that the value we'd have in our time otherwise would be drained. In that sense, we wish to make a purchase, and thus choose not to purcahse soemthing other; but one of the main reasons we witheld, is that the cost of the one good was so that the benefit (or size of good) of the other, was brought down so much as to not warrant that other good.
            <br>&emsp;Generally, there are amends for us which are based on neccessity, and in turn provide us peace and quiet; while those which draw us from these steady grounds, are rooted in the effects of excess; which themselves should not cause shortcomings to our neccessary responses, nor be only as positivie as to only enjoy a select amount of things, at the cost of others. This is why reading and writing is so wonderful, for it makes everything better, in both the soothing state which it procurrs, along with the effective product of having read and written. While drinking and crumby food tend to wipe all other activitires of an active sort away, and give the sole permitt to themselves. Yet such an expereince fails under further scrutiny. 
            <br>&emsp;What I lack, deliberatley, is a career, an aim, an objective. I can't say why I should have one though; or at least if it could be argued why I should, then I couldn't say which one I should have. For I believe the root of our efforts is born of desire; and by that, the reason for having an objective is that it promises such comfort. Yet I am not convinced that the objects of those desires are either good as the peace and stability of virtue, nor as pleasing and dear as the object of those. Perhaps that is the point, that stability is not crucially forgiven due to money and other fortune; as the composure of ourselves, our ultimate demise, and the otherwise requisite treatment of our intelligent mind, removes any real reason to achieve or succeed outside of peace's post. She may see and be drawn; and by admittance we are all imperfect, and pressed as such during our duties and tasks. But so is the fair line of growth one where those demands are evened out (and less pressing), as is our ability and care to respond, more effective and less consuming. The might of discernment then, says that the peace found in such neccessity, is good enough to be, while you are gratefully so, or more liberally drawn. Which itself, is not a limiting stance on certain goods. But of those which have their roots in relief and comfort, so will the path of that flatten out to ends which are staked on fortunes outside of our peace and moderate comfort. And by that account, those goods which compell us in such liberal (or excess ways) can be fairly deemed as truely so, when they are not so drawn out, and effect us in fleeing ways -whereby our steadyness is ruffled. Where instead, we act, consent and proceed, in ways most becoming to the peace born appropriateness within neccessary action, and that of pure felicity.

        <div id="tidesofcontent">
            Circumstances can definitely tweak a certain strand of you, revealling the nature of the core complex. Simply, there a things I must be doing, which is to say that there are holes which will widen and implode less I address them. This usually includes our mortal regard, our family intent, our health and otherwise frugal disposition. In front of this though lies things which you wish to become apart of, to be treated with, or provided from. These are your childish fancies to be famous, to explore the world, to be all high and mighty in your excitement, and impressive in this: to be known. The reality though, is that these things require as much effort to facilitate as their view is grand. And when you take the fact of touring, and compare that to the limitless view of travelling the world, you can see how one is really some fancy that compares to one's dream of being King, while the other is an activity, and at hand with something achievable amongst whats common. Yet, in viewing it as touring, or having enough investment as to move past soul or collective happiness, but sole wealth and collective management, the dream seems less alive, as it is not really one, but a thing instead. 
            <br>&emsp;Now, shouldering all this is the most elusive prompt, which is similar to those of a negative kind, but more prone to offer something positive. Whereas your health speaks out to you, saying that our nature is such that withotu certain regards, the environment will cause certain effects. While the sun, offers us a point to blossom from, as marvelling in her, defining her ways, relishing what she means, or in other words treating her, does more than simply brace our bones, but flourish the beat of our heart, and otherwise remove any rust and immobility to our soul. Dreams some to reflect this, in that they are points which offer some sort of promise. Yet, the distance of those spots comes equally to how far the start of our gaze is distant from our selves. That is why I say, that if we are near and at hand, where peace is our common state, then the points of interest are those which unveil themselves from that. Besides the actual distance, there's a sort of fuzziness, as if what is common is selected based on how well we can be drawn to it. So those who relief themselves and otherwise fail to bolster their corporal needs, may not be struck by the color and industry thats pointed out to them; while a more obvious trip might. And at any rate, as those fuzzy ends match the quality of the person, so would a broader wish that came from someones dream -albeit ingraced to their pecuniary means- would still be but of a more fancy novelty. As, one who is in their norm, sees a trip to somewhere close by as exciting, while someone who's sight lies further, and builds their means to amend, does have a nice trip -as if it were exotic and out of this world. But so is it still a trip, and of a touring kind.
            <br>&emsp;And so it seems preferable to be in a state of content, and oblige those dearer interests pointed out from there. Yet, sometimes it feels like our demands are within our grasp, and nothing is so plainly set for us to do. At this point, the weariness that comes from being content raises its tide; though, it is not but a known truth that this occurs because the vitality of your requirments and felicitiy of interest which your content is central too, is not so definite and thus known. So being content feels like were missing out, as someone who is but stable too and sees a vacation, might look at you and say, 'oh wow, your so evened out and free, why not take a nicer trip; or better yet, beyond the pecuniary need, why not form a life revolved around travelling, or being a rockstar, or anything for that matter that would reminsisce of our dreams: for you are free, with all the time in the world: why not marshal it for the greatest of things!'. And my response is a critical one, as I see those boundless desires and dreams as unbecoming, if and only if their view and station is one that holds only a life for you. And the reality is, that once you see anyone looking past, and you are in fact treated to the nature of your life and quality of time, you realize that all is there only for you, and that less everyone thinks your special, and your adventure makes you remarkable and cool, so are you left with the mere activity at hand: which doesn't compare to what is born through felicity: and by that, the truth in that our life really is our time -for who is so distant from themselves in that sense- favors us more when the actions and steps are of leisure, industry and care. While the magnificence of Shambala, or the intrigue made from your ways, is really the curse of novelty and remission; as these things come from those outside themselves, or furried at least, and thust are drawn and set past those centered lands of peace and fecundity. Where instead, the time and activity which draws their hand, is that of a more exoctic and glamorous sort. Yet, the core critique, is that the shape and product of these ventures, no matter how well realized, have their worth and anticipation rooted in the fancy'd expectation that other people will  care, and that it is not so much what seeing the pyramids or touring the world will bring, but what it means rather. "And by that, the stake of this, seems to be in what we'd recieve, as our time and person seem so beautifull and interesting: who wouldn't offer me their own time and attention, and reward me thus."

        <div id="partialpath">
            I think the reason were feeling a little awry, is our lack of power; which in this modern age, is bound to money. Power isn't so worthwhile in when it comes to mortality, family and health, but regarding certain novelties and flavor, so is cash required. Worth noting is that we are not working, and thus any cost upon us drains our cash. While, if we were working, to a neutral point even, the income we had would afford me some relief; for credit is not so harsh -especially when you are not making large expenditures.
            <br>&emsp;But, what comes to mind then, is whether more money should be sought, or we should amend ourselves as appropriate without money. Both choices are subject to the general truths of our lives; for be it ambitious or peacefull, we are still men.
            <br>&emsp;Theres been this notion for along time, whereby our personal effords would be improved, or bolstered at least, if we had the means for fun and privilage. This usually amounted to hoping for family fortune, or that of fame. But such hardly come to pass, or at least must be waited upon. And this is fair. As our life has become more objective, and our satiety within that has relieved any pressing need for such things to be more than themselvs, so has everything smoothen out. Yet, we had the fair means to purchase a scooter, as to improve our own localle lives. Be it in casuall strolls, practical adjustment to weather and time, or the broader means to accomodate living situations -as food, work and interests have further ranges, and thus bear us a broader selection of viable places to live. Only, this scooter is a vehicle, and is subject to repair. In particular, reckless use affords consequences, or the chance at least. And by that, we seem powerless to oblige. At least, our lack of income seems to leave us exposed to the cut of our reserve. 
            <br>&emsp;On that note, it is worthwhile to mention how being clear and objective in your life removes this draining feeling. At least, since our efforts and aims are made on things of felicity and care, so do our worries of power wain; as we need none of it; nor is our depletion of it consequential. Moreover, the base notion that neccessity requires the means to it, so is our clarity and stable means to achieve that, one which bolsters our otherwise discontent and spilling our excess. In that, power, albeit the same in what it is within our basest efforts, is realy banked on excess. Yet in that, the value of acquiring that power is worth questioning. For, ceratin things require no power, but time and effort. While those occupations which yeild power, require their own efforts. Worth is one thing, while accounting is the other. At least, if we look at particular cases, we can see how much time and effort is needed in order to get the minimum, or an extent; whereby we can cover the breadth of all cases, and consider how we should apply. At least, we may look at life as composed of factors; and objectively, each has its product and requirments, and can thus be arranged in terms of the effort you put in, and what you get out.
            <br>&emsp;For me, a core point is that of minimums. For we may put a little bit of effort into many things, with the thought that each will give us a little. Yet, considering how even the itinerary of each requires more time than the actual appointments, bears equal regard as what those appointments require of us to earn something at all. This is like saying that we can pursue medicine to a certain degree, and thus recieve a reward of equal degree. Yet one can not be a partial doctor. Nor, beyond the requisite education, can one likely find employment part time. Or, if they did, it would likely be of a particular case, and less lucrative. This is just our assessment though. For, we might say that value allows us not to describe every single case, and determine which one is favorable. At least, rather than exhaust our options as to be clear on which ones are best, let us refine what makes the best things what they are, by defining the scale by which such things become the best. In that, I find that most things are good because you enjoy doing them; and otherwise they bear security. And as we assess ourselves in particalr -beyond the general qualities- we notice that there are many core factors worth tending to, or consequnetial at least if not. And by that, we can see that ignoring those leads to desires and affability to ends which are in truth novel. For, our body bears us a measure of health; and beyond its longevitiy, so is its nearer paces measured in vitality and strenght. If its state is crumbier though, or worn, than what we seek and judge by, will reflec that. And, for the sake of discernemnt, we say that those things which are good, but so from our poor state, are novel; for their worth is not actually from any point of strenght, but shortcoming. "Relieve my pains and squabblings: such a request is not becoming though, as its worth is based on you not being who you really are."
            <br>&emsp;What I would conclude with, for our benefit, is this notion of a brace; which is to say that we cannot simply do the minimum amount, for consistency will wain; nor can we do a small amount at all and expect anything worthwhile. In that, we ought to let our reasoning determine the values of our selves, and thus appropraite to what is fair and obvious to that -in the cases were judging at least. Yet, in order not to let any loosness, experience or incoming impressions unsteady you as to your amends, let us put a brace on those we have selected; as to remove any fleeing fear or discontent at the fact that 'were missing out on those other things'. For in those we deemd well, we are already tasked enough, nor lacking the according reward. And, at any rate, what we consider well to adjust, is the lenght of that brace and where it applies, and those things which fit upon such standard of value. But of those fancy's behind us, which in our complacency to the good even, fairs no worth in our regard: for of what is familiar as dear, is either being worked on, or known. "So even in our idling states, we need not fear the quench of other frivolitises. For the good holds our commitmment."

        <div id="livingjoy">
            I know who I am. I am boundless within a powerless state: and all those who are not so and seek the latter, stick little to our farther ways -as we are but light and gentle, however far, while there aim is from further below, to a place which is limited by power. While for me, the only limit is what I can see and treat.
            <br>&emsp;We are afraid though, perhaps because we are still with a body. And, weirdly, it is words which remove our bounds, in that we can acquire more with what is at hand; or at any rate not be taken by things we may not have (as our lack of power reflects). Yet, we still have needs, and cannot live in that boundless way. Only, our minds and spirit can transcend that; yet, in our natural case, this is not something we wish for, but see right now. The sun is always there, as the abscence of it would render us not so. As is the mooon somewhat essential, and present no less. The color of the sky is forever on, as are the sounds of the wind, birds, nothing. The color of it all can provide a constant amazement, as can the reality which spurrned others wonder and thought, treat us -as if it were from the scent alone. 
            <br>&emsp;These are living joys, as opposed to those promised after we are not within a body. To that there is rest, while this body of mine, sees it has everything it could have; and it is words and ideas which remove, rearrange, conceive and align to further wonders of the world. By that, we are free, and deliberate with our unbounded sense -which, as it were, becomes so as our needs hold less attention. By that, the world can be seen and our treatment drawn. 
            <br>&emsp;Yet, this is not overwhelmingly so for all people. And in fact, even those who I see as comparable, rest only near the edge of the domain; and in fact have their sights and hold on those realms adjacent. In that we are alone, outside the cave to ourself. In many ways there are people who are forward, but they are but on nicer properties within the realm of fortune. While my location is within vastness of liberty and treatment.
            <br>&emsp;What I see, is that our resolve is like the sun, in that I choose not when and where I shine, but gleam everywhere I stand. In that, I am never alone, for I am bolstered from within. Yet, I cannot say exactly what the right path is; and by that, I wonder whether we are contridcting ourself in temrs of our intentions; whereby we would actually be better off moving towards things within a better oriented stare. As long mentioned, our general view was that our shine would be known by others, to which we'd be well off. But, this is no longer our stake; and thus our perfection is removed; to which we have room to partake in things which would otherwise run contrary to perfection -but still fair.
            <br>&emsp;In a way, we are in fact with power, as the results of contribution in fact fill me up; which isn't something that travelling the world or being famous differs from. Its usually the material limits that power is referring to, while the actual activity were in usually holds our more heartfelt hand. Yet by that, all is known, and through words and reading we treat it. How rich I am. 
        </div>
        <div id="raisingourcourse">
            It seems like our means for things is not much outside ourselves. Even our scooter, which seemed so promoising, requires more than our common life can procurr. Though, this is but circumstantial, as we are living quite private.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, the matter of money, or power comes to question. For I don't think there's much worth in what it provides, compared to those true bouldess activites. But even if there is worth, it is not to relieve your own shortcomings, but of neccessity, or fairness at that.
            <br>&emsp;I think what is reassuring is considering that there is a bound, by which we can attest to our lack, and otherwise found power and reward through our own faculties. Which, to be clear, is not so much about being resourcefull and disciplined, as to acquire, but to see, read, write, rest.Those things may be viable, in that you can simply try, but their distance is as far as your control is required.
            <br>&emsp;I just feel isolated, like were on an island with no where to go. Even once we move, I am sure that the regularity of work and limitation of your walking ways, will foster some discontent. At least, clarity can give things and their requisites more worth, in that they are more definite in how you spend. But generally, it seems like most things are in need of something more than our common effort can procurr. And as it were, if those means of ours directed themselves towards the means of acquiring those outer things, so would this come at the expense of our dearest efforts; nor would the  contentment of being simply alright, be in accordance with seeking more. This isn't so explicit.
            <br>&emsp;I look at our familiart with the true goods, and how are content is really so, yet worn against as we are so outside anytrhing else. And so, as our discontent wains, so does our purity; in that we can not just be alright, and look forward to our avtivity tomorrow; but we have to be busy, and thus our free time becomes indulgent; which itself has no real amends in such pecuniary ways, but then drenches our means for activity. Simple improvements and the vulnerable try things which are not much more than appointments, offers us potential fairly. But to me, the goods of leisure, industry and care, are such that a flow of life is all we need. Being incomplete about this though, brings our properity away from what our activity breathes from; and otherwise our mealy attempt to acquire power sees us empty handed. In fact, the tale of my life has been in those idle ways, whereby neither happiness or success was found: and our constant refinement of the former. And again, it is not that money, friends, romance or impact can't be had, simply even. But these are not what were judged by; or at least what our impressions scorn us against. Those bear upon us the values of tradition or adolescence, in that we don't have enough security or estates; or on the other hand, were not swashbucklers or rockstars. 
            <br>&emsp;This is all in conflict what those things which actually make me happy. Yet, of these, they are but truer fortunes ontop of a solid man; which is to say that we have our own and current wares, and merely occupy ourselve in appropraite ways to those seperate goods. But, if we are scrutinzed, or isolated, due to those other lackings, then so are we unable to be ourselves; nor are the true goods we lack able to be seperate from us with an otherwise equanimity, but shame and dissaproval. "As we are looked down upon to not have a home or be a success, so are pressured to feel similarly poor in not having what we atually seek. Whereas before, we could view these desires with groundess and faith." So by that, our own happiness is in fact worn when what we seek is so stringently absent. Yet in our peacefull ways, so are we fine and ready; and herein able and free to pleasantly proceed. But when those intrusions of fear and brattiness come in, they disettle to, to which we comfront such intrusions, but feel unsteady too about our actual wishes. 
            <br>&emsp;In that, it fairs well to have clarity on btoh ends, as not to be so exposed to what others critique you on -for you see their weakness, or, through comparison or fortitude succeed elsehwere. Or, on the other hand, breathing more definition into what you really seek brings life to your course, and otherwise makes your advance to things more buyont and present; as if you are rich, but from these gentle grounds. "Like we are set within ourselves, but bearing fortune, because we can more clearly see it. Combingin that with the ease on arrival, makes our course one which is truly integral, as in the present, but sweet and warming as the gradual promise which our natural path gleams, seems more obvious and clear."
        </div>
        <div id="properpath">
            So I can mention alot, but I will do so with clear definition and discernment. Firstly, the future is bright by the merrits of privilage, whereby you are given things owed, fortune, whereby things outside your domain favor you -ie. tax returns, goverment gifts- chance, whereby oppertunity and or change offers benefit, and congruence, whereby your inner equities bring your own soverign goods, or your fortitude can endure what is lacking in neccessity or novelty. These elements afford one the steady supply of improvment, whereby their natural and composed prescence, affords them both the means to amend, learn and grown, and otherwise receive, by expectation, gradation or receipts. 
            <br>&emsp;In that, I am more accustomed to let the future happen. And while this doesn't grant me much in terms of kingship or wealth -outside our lineage at least- I am not so concerned as to be unset towards that, as my aim is moreso towards the activity within my life, and the pleasures and goods that surround that. In that sennse, my main task, when benefit is to be occrued by faith and the currents of favor and time, is to clarify what we don't need and that which we do, so that our current happiness doesn't implode under our own fleeing whims, or others intruding scorn -at me not being so direct. In that, if we can idenitfy things, then their worth can be defined as bounded, without worth, or out of interest. Moreover, of those things which I would like, so can their natural pace come about as we are not so withdrawn from them in our own merry process. That is all to say, that if we are sure of the things we like -in what they mean and amount to- then we will not be so dischevled at being withtou them; for their place on our path will seem more known. In effect, we are not so hollow in sincerity; and so when we are unable to fend off complaints or fears regarding our lack of interest in other things, so will we not be revealed -or disheartened internally- at the lack of things which we would in fact like. For such things take their own time to procurr; and at any rate, are but natural desires which are better accompaniments then occupations. These amount to earning more money through suitable trades, making friends by sharing being open about your interests, finding romance or relationships by simply trying (through resources, or improved communication), and being happy amidst others, whereby our broadest efforts and industry are built on what we sincerely wish to produce and speak about, and thus feel rewarded at even the slightest agreement and or interest by other's. Whereas being successfull amongst other people requires that your attract a great deal of people, and towards a source who's form is bent for pecuniaries sake, so is the form of our source whose bend is done so for happiness, needs only attract a few. For it is in many ways enough for me; and as I smolder the embers into the mildest of flames, it is simply alright to feel the warmth yourself, and enjoy whoever seeks the same. Its not reassure, but the annals of gradual progress, fostered through our sincere intent, means that our fire will grow, more will attend, and whereas a couple if not a hundred folk were drawn, so could we reach a thousand. Again, the limits are not our concern, as we are pleased right now, and looking merely to advance that pleasure into a place and through a suitable form, as to be happy, in that we were trying, and others shown -with receptivity, to which 'we are happy' becomes so. A million followers or subjects based on something that I would not be keen towards myself, is worth less to me than a 100, 30 even, when the flame which we gather around, or at least the words which come from the pulpit that I stand, is one becoming of me: which itself, on the grounds of our maturity, is remarked of the dearest things. To which I alone, with a few, and even more whereby the admittedly fair amount would still seem extreme, is enough. So I stand.
            <br>&emsp;And quickly, as it must be mentioned, is that due to our ups and downs as are natural to our living nature, so is it usefull to understand the worth and futility in the objects of wealth. Namely, travelling and infamy. Simply, the former holds goods that more often than not reflect a composure which is already unsettled; whereby, if the mere act of travelling is whats deemed good, then it is not likley that what is truyl good on arrival, will be known. For touring is one thing, and even the worst of us may earn much favor. Yet we still return to our ordinary lives. Its the constance of moving and all the excitment and anticaption which that brings. Yet there isn't anything different wherever you go; and the only thing that does in fact differ, is where you see yourself going, in that more is to come. Yet you must always continue. Nor, is the journey much of worth, as unless you are on your feet, then you simply pass everything by: with either too much speed or focus required to operate your means for transport. And at that, you are left with the sensation that you are going. Not only does our buisness, family and or congruence with well being flatten the interest or ability to constantly move. And by that, momentary moves, either settle into familiarty, or are but novelties, in both experience and remedy: for life is returned too: and at any rate, the gift of what you see is not so saturating when the flavor is based on neweness or difference: as that will not translate to an imoproivment of what you see upon your return. In other words, the value of moving is not so dear to me, as its efforts are taxing, costly, novel, and otherwise besides our interest of leisure, industry, and care. To be fair, those real goods delight in having a life which is less simple and common; yet, the ability to change that, is so that either cash is spent on moments of change, or transitions at that: yet the quality of your life remains. Being more mobile holds some favor, but again, not much more than smoothing out your dearer efforts. And at any rate, whatever pleasure comes from being more mobile, requires the training and employment within suitable roles. Which itself, takes time, a minimum amount of committment and interest as to maintain your invovlement, and a similar standard as to retain your ability throughout your employment. Time can be spent, and the natural development from student, apprecntince into the journeyman state whereby our leverage can be brought wherever, is not barred from us. But only a select amount of positions offer rewards of that kind. Nor is that requirment for all this a limiting factor of our lives; merely a garnish to what is otherwise secure and comofrting. Our address is merely one of leninance; whereby we feel more content with the common paces of our liberty, and apply ourselves (through committment and itinerary) for those novel benefits. But it is surely a campaign within its own right, as you must pick the right path, stick to it while your are prior to the real benefit; and otherwise apply yourself upon that, which itself deserves some regard -as the end which your choice is based on, waivers both on the reward which you seek, and the ultimate obligation which that requires. I feel that infamy can be assessed this way. For those ends come through means which are not becoming or servicebale to liberty; or, if they come from liberty, or run beside it, so are those paths comaprable to that of trades, in that you must learn, practice and deploy. The dynmics of attraction are one thing, for you obivously won't earn everyone's regard overnight. But so is the campaign which will foster all those stages of growth, a long one. In some sense, we are talking about bringing our liberal goods to a successfull state; but so is the buisness of that a constant one. For as you attract some, the leverage that you have is only usefull in that it attracts more. And I do mean to be open about this, for if I have time, then the training required can be adhered to. Though, the employment fairs questioning. Generally, if your success is digital, then that can be brought anywhere. And to be fair, this is the clear desire. At least, in terms of a profession or source of income, so would you want it through a computer. You just have to consider how much the a mobility of your life will cost, in both the training and occupation. If we had all the money in the world currently, so would we simply apply ourselves into expanding our happiness. And that earns little favor from money, but soothing our fatigue. 
            <br>&emsp;In short, online trades and community take time, and otherwise grow with our constant additions. All for the sake of soothing our fatigue. And otherwise, our genuine time which holds the value in our invovlement as compared to the monetary ends, is immediate, as our employment is but through our intent and activity. "Registering for something in that sense is exciting, for we are stepping towards what you want to do. While, if our excitement is based on the intiaition down a path which is lucartive, then so is the distance of that end bare us a hollowing effect: for we are not so privilaged now."
        </div>
        <div id="howweare">
            So I know not the finality of things, in either ends, origin, or, accordingly, substance. But, I can ask qualified questions; which, in effect, bears me an idenitity of such ends, but with reproach.
            <br>&emsp;On the other hand, more local matters, or at least prompts which are not neccessarily reproached, can be more meagerly qualified. In that, we can more clearly identify things how they actually are, or otherwise evaluate them based on select criteria. 
            <br>&emsp;For instance, Canada is a free country, in that all have suffrage, there are laws which can be followed, liberty to be gained, and otherwise punishment which is earned on the basis of crimes, rather than custom. This is what Canada is. 
            <br>&emsp;But in another light, I might outline the general field of government, in that there are those who have fair laws and punishment, harsh laws and fair punishment, harsh laws and according punishment, no laws and acceptable punishment, or the worst, no laws and horrid punishment. I can say that Canada fits into the foremost. And although the US, Britain and France are not so exposed within by domain of knowledge, so am I confident in saying that their punishments are not handed out indiscrimanetly, and with any harsh corporal edge. So much as they are not in fact lower, I am confident in placing them in that first category. For each, as far as I do in fact know, is a republic, or confederacy of states; and even Russia, who's executvie power supposedly is much fimrer than most, still compares in having laws and the means to obey them. This, mind you, is only current, as they quality of such realms varies as we go back in time. But right now at least, we seem quite privy to a country which I can strictly identify as good, and at any rate qualify as preferable; alongside the bulk of other major countries; and the even further advent of united nations and leagues. "A confederacy of nations, rather than the sole nation makeup of states: countries are the latter."
        </div>
        <div id="lordandhammer">
            Due to the very concret nature of governance, it is quite easy to speak on its behalf. In a way, writing about real things is always easier; only, in the case of society, the elements are actuall of relevance to me, compared to our thoughts on astronomy for instance.
            <br>&emsp;Anyways, the core mark which has stuck within me is this distinct notion of 'man and subject', the latter being a member of the state, and at least with respect to other subjects, that is an association. While the man, is merely so, in that his status as a subject is similar to his post within a profession:  whereby we'd say he is in association within that. What a man is innately is not so easy to say, but I do enjoy this distinction. For me, the example of two folks on a deserted island, who are people outside of any state, and are thus only privy to their personal selves. Yet, if they obliged to amend to eachother with the aim of further prospering, and through rules and organization, than to eachother they would be associated as subjects; or at least if there were more than two of them, those who were of the authoritarites would hold those outside as their subjects, who in turn are subjects of such state; and otherwise in association to other subjects; which is to say, that as men, they are members in association amongst eachother with respect to their shared post as subjects within the state.
            <br>&emsp;Second on my mind is this learing notion of honor and liberty. On one hand, it seems the latter comes from order, or at least regality and its admonition to one's standing. Strict respect for elders, parents, those within the nobility or courts, or even one's who are simply of higher status civilly, marks such a tendency. In this, the worse one usually recieves is scrutiny over their disrespect. Which itself contrasts with the linens of liberty, whereby one's freedom and whims is what is both reverred and demonstrated. It is by these where the friction between people lie. For one may have that wandering heart, but be part of a family who is orderly and hierarchical. Or, someone may be of a liberal kind, and free to be so, but notice points that are more regal, and thus risks for incoming scorn. This is where I personally find myself subject to frustration. For my parents are free going, yet act sometimes as though their place as parent's holds the merrit of their age. While other times, there are those without much regality, and thus my own personal tideinss seems unfitting. This is all fine, but so do are idling times recieve an emphasis of scorn; and usually by others who appear to be condeming me for my lack of position; or, I am jealous, and at least footnoting my reasons elsewhere to not be galavanting, or living without structure at least. Simply, the world is a mix, and be it tendencies within a culture, to those within a family, it seems that the shine coming out of everyone is varied. This is the mark of an unhappy man though, for what I deem right, ought flourish from our amends, and thus sturdy us with both stability and content, and in effect not notice the flames of others.

            My scooter is a seldom expense; nor is its purpose short of essential: in its addition at least. It is being serviced though, and so I cannot help be feel some angst at the thought of whether it will be fixed. And although the issue isn't large, I am not convinced there wont be future problems. There are reasons for our issue; nor have the proper preventions been employed. The nature of our way is simply at risk; and by that I will likely not purchase a scooter which isnt with solid tires. By that, there is some room to try the current repair; and from their, we can try and solve the problem along normal lines, or make a larger investment for a more reliable scooter.
            <br>&emsp;Simply though, are output is flourishing. Effectively, we have nothing we really have to do; though, the pace of our day is somewhat compact, espcially without the scooter. Were quite occupied, and without much room to recouperate; which itself bears reason to attend our past times; but so are we a little bundled amidst those. Still, the scooter was ment to support this course of life, and in most ways has. It just isnt so stable in doing so, particularly in more adventurous ways. Nevertheless, these future appointments can bear the slowing rate of our days, by resting on the fact that such eveness will be the norm, and that such appointments will in fact accomodate that. So right now, if your a little bent, those involvements will actually do you good; but even if you dont want to, remember that their requirment is small, and that by attending you make the future attendences more swift and approachable. And since our normal pace will prefer that anyway, do yourself a favor and work through the fear attendace -in that it makes you slow- as both a current remedy, or stabling committment.
            <br>&emsp;Besides that, there is really not much but our activity. Our health is ripe for concern, and our activity of life has some composure by those outward committments. But we really are free and able to do as we please. Which, naturally has limits, and otherwise fidgits a little as your haste bears more hopes ahead. But so will this iron itself out; and our scooters final repair will not fail to support that. Really though, I just want to read and write; and walking thorugh the day, sitting where we can, exercising in and out, brings me cheer and a neccessary stature, as to breath and live truly. Everything else wraps around this nicely. And even those further amends, have more room than you'd think; or at least your fortunate enough to have such wiggle room; but the means and reason to bind to even the shorter side of things. 
            <br>&emsp;So by that, I feel set for an inward settlement; whereby we are truly at ease while occupied, and proceeding by the delta of time, as the future becomes present and we merrily ride along. By that, I see our finances as a ripe support. And considering were tired, and yet to explore the immediate options, so will we fix our scooter: which seems the most worthwhile, as it allows us to broaden our currated life. Theres no advantage which holds no worth. Yet, it is still an addition; and of what core, so can we fair rightily by our own: this is but our inquiry and means coming as one: like we once did we flat foot shoes. It surely wasnt the best purchase; though I cant really despair, as our worse fear was its actual ability to pleaase us; while now, it seems that even the basics would do; while the place for it though actually holds its own bars. Still, we can ultimately amend, and otherwise furnish our local life. Which, addmittedly, our respect and reflections would later oblige. I need not much more than what our future needs. And in that, I seek the fragments, videos and shows, an occasioanl movie, and the games which furnish my life. Exercise in its own right pairs swell with deliberate occupation, as your freedom in that sprouting end, settles your movement and training into being sufficinet upon completion. "Which is to say that there isnt fear or worry that there isnt something more in what its for. But me, and all our cheer in being so vital."
            <br>&emsp;In that, lifes specifics hold a fair course, and an otherwise adaptable road in front. Mom and Dad are leaving, which improves all steps, and our general health allows us to make use of the warming lands. Otherwise, our working vehicle gives us a great place to read, or further angle to see our country. Which, admittedly, is something were losing; though that really reflects your worn out pace. Usually the day holds all when your really well; and by that, what is familiar brightens you still: for your there so much to treat it.

            Quickly, I must mention this remark made by Kant, whereby the battleground for non-emperical experience is in metaphysics. By that, I relate, but no in the need of such a basic anwser; rather, I am amused by our own particularity, and what I acutally seek to know and explore. In terms of knowledge, I see much that is covered in whats common; and fairly, I think any confusion there is from a weak toolset of how objects are within entirety; and how our premature depiction of the latter bears mistakes in the former. By that, I believe that death is merely a description of a living thing disconfigurating; as if by time and physioolgy we whithered away. So on and so forth, there isnt much knowledge which I cant explain, or consider at least as merely relevant within our objective realm. What entirety is in its own right, seems beyond these common questions, but is a curisoity no less. And perosnally, I see our notion of space's existence as a prompt for ontology, as to consider that fact. And by that, there is much description which can detail entirety. But as for its relevance, I would not say it is so in any traditional way. What I would say, is that although I know the consequences of life are a time of peace, and freely, I still think our amends to that is one of angst; which in fact remarks our curisoity to begin with, as knowing the whole would give more relief regarding our part. So there is a purpose in having an ontology, as it bears us down the chartered road. Only, the merrit of this understanding can become to bent onto having one at all, as opposed to it being true. And over time, I'd venture that our views on ourselves are made with respect to our ontological positions; only these are incredibly weak, or without the strenght that our beliefs would suppose. In a way, we are being ontological when we refer to things as being only ostensibly configured of entirety; and that although  I may not know what that entirety is, so are those subjects (or configurations) are within the domain of what I actually care about; or at least, can be defined as subjects, and act as a sufficent anwser. In other words, death is merely a part of us, as things; though the actual mark of death and our being dead, is not but a part of our place as things, but not strictly born from the entirety of things itself. In that sense, the nature of things is so that all things would compare. While a flame dying out due to a lack of oxygen and fuel, is merely an objective end, or at least advancement of the configuration of things: and our death is no different: but, accordingly, is not an actual mark of the end of all things, or at least things in their entirety, but our own configuration. That is, death is to do with living, and by that, the pieces which form rocks and air, are but dissamebly from their microbial legacy (of which we are the current step as mammals): and as members within that, so does our state change from young, to old, to nothing. Hereby, the expereince of warmth and memory fade, and we are no more: there is not what is effectively true for an atom, or a thing in its entirety: which defintiively, is not of those things which only come from configuration.

            I am indeed quite tired, and in effect unable to think. Part of the reason, is that my body is overly stiff; albeit of a gentle sort, as there is in fact no pain, it is not exactly broad and open, to which our mobility and vitality wain. 
            <br>&emsp;One of the consequences to this though, is that in situation, of namely poltiics and logic, where opinions are ardently, or at least prudishly made, I am unable to remain reproached with thought. And, generally, I believe most of their views to be wrong, or at least the position of their arguments to be inferior to ones becoming of the whole world, or entirety. By this, I either restlessly disagree, or uncomfortably reproach through thought: which itself causes further wear.
            <br>&emsp;This is a nice sentiment though, as I have struggled with this for years; particularly in politics or civil cases since moving in with my parents. The probelm isnt that their views are wrong, or weak  for that matter, but their insistence, or committment to the view. There is very little reproach of their own, which makes both their stance seem hollow and rigid; but equally, the actual issue at hand is given way to much prevelance, for what its worth at least. 
            <br>&emsp;PErsonally, I know everything; at least, if there was a true encylopedia, I could assign everything to a specific portion, or realm at least. This segregation within the domain is something I understand, even if the actual parts I dont know. But, I have a wholesome sense of the world and entirety; and by that, I see the issues of reason and presidency to be mild at best. Moreover, my actual views on those things are no different than our views on the finer issues, in that each is dealt with thought and care, not opinions or assumption. 
            <br>&emsp;I must say that as my understanding grows, so do I feel more content inwardly, as even my restless state wears little in its disposition. Which is to say that Kants massive treatise on reason may overwhelm our thinking, but so is its importance but a heirloom of thought. By that, our need for significance is not bothered, as the thing were seeing isnt so inflammatory against our priorities. Still, the actual thinking wears me thin, as beyond the initial sentence or two where he's curious and speculative, he then goes 700 pages on about what he is so clever to prove. I don't mind his confidence, or his lauding over traditions head; but he's so clear on his means and form of inquiry, that I cant help but be put of by the entire lack of substance: which, ultimatley, comes down to the emphasis on ideas, rather than things. At least for me, personally, my wonderment about the bones of nature come from the appearences of her products, and the mystery of how those came to be. I may be privilaged to be so skeptical since the advent of real cosmology, but so has that merely extended the reach by which our ultimate curiosity should go. Yet, I find little relation in what most people say, as it points little to any existing end; which, in my own experience, falls way short of those ultimate bounds. "As if someone said, with a practical guarantee, that I'd be wholly rich and powerful, eternally even. Yet, principally, I did not know the nature of guarentees, or the bounds of time." 
            <br>&emsp;At this point our own argument comes into question; as it makes little sense that there would be a laundry list of theories and ideas, based similarly will say in terms of topics, and that each held the same merrit and truth. It would be odd for nature to be a mixture of ways; or at least, of entirety, that it would have more than what we'd more prudently say 'as its nature', meaing one -or its. I am not so educated as to refute or consider all the elements and cares of those before me. As I see it, they are merely using an assortment of tools to identify and describe nature. Explanations seem somewhat contradictory, less you believe that nature is seperate from the products -or in our case, subjects- that she would seemingly be the bearer of. Or in other words, how would heat and sound, tissue, cells, molecules, atoms, particles, waves and space be ontop of something, and not the webing itself. Intuitively, I'd say our task is to be so reflective, and describe things on the basis of what a proper description is. But in that, we have an issue, as the entity of space is not fully known; and by that, it is hard to even say 'all of existence in and of itself'. In effect, we are somewhat barred from approaching our description in such a way. Here though, the ultimate challenge lies.
            <br>&emsp;You see, if something isnt knonw, the only way to proceed is throug inquiry. I am more than aware of givens that people take, and otherwise maxims (so to speak) that permitt the whole extent of maxims used to generate principles. But we are trying to define the world. Nor, does it massiveness warrant much ignorance of its prescence; rather, the merrit of determinging the means for inquiry, is quite worthless besides its offer of defining the actual entities at hand. Simply, to reiterate somewhat, we are of the opinion, or at least our reproach has kept us from falling over ourselves, whereby we still retain this sense, that things are not seperate from a supposed nature which procurred them, but that all is complete in unison and entirety. Those two notions may contradcit, as the former suggests a real individuality and thus conflicts with any real notion of entirety. But so are we demonstrating discourse, and by that, we mean only to further stitch our subjects and inquiry. There are indeed common rules that warrant this; and ultimately, if that seems intellectually squeemish or cowardice, I would still say that we are appropriate to be on the edge of what is actually known, and that the a priori principles that regard the ideas of things, is not decent or integral enough to play the actual things their supposing. Those real things, would remark the nature whihc we suppose. But so are those things needed for our investigation. I may not have the tutelaged means to say why there would be no issue if nothing real was known but that which was a priori, but that would surely be a non existant place. And, most presumably, any existence for which those misty reasons reflect, holds no real bearing itself, as the actual bounds and substance of such reality is unknown. Particularly, this regards the quandery of space, and that, in comparison to say a bowl which held nothing in it, that space was not in fact outside the bowl, but a part of the container. Differing the notion of abscences amongst the medium, is the trily voident notion of nothing, in that there wasnt even a place where abscence could be: this sort of nothing, or void, is given the term barren. And it is that pecularity of barreness which marks the objective investigation of what metaphyscis wishes to afford. The subject of death, mind, beginnig and end all lie here, and hold no care or concern for a priori reasoning. At the very least, all things that we know are bound within entirety, and bear the terms existence, reality, objects,  things. It is what is outside of entirety, or what is not, that holds our boldest regard. "For just as there may be no fish on a plate, but a plate, so may our thoughts actually be of something when we regard the void outside of abscence: which to me, better reflects our limitations of thinking, and their ultimte quality of referencing something. Metaphysiucs then feels like the real mind forming tactics, which itself compares to the organ of our skin and nerves repealing away from a flame: in that for each, they are born and productive of something real. By that, our regard for the void is but a fabled sort, and by that, we are tasked with the prospects of furthering our physical vocabualalry: as to at least no what the void would mean. All though, while we remain reproached; or in rather, to that which is out."

        <div id="rightofgood">
            Simply, we are a man, which means that within a free state, we still employ reason. This remarks Plutarch's sentiment, 'that when young folks lose the shackles of their parents and adulthood, that the release is not into a realm of lawless frolicking, but one in which reason is their guide'.
            <br>&emsp;In that, I see that as we are free, so do our senses and touch bend; and by that, we are no longer in a state of fear or obligation, but curisoity and amends. In effect, desire comes to fruition; which contrasts with a lower state, wherebby the removal of things -ie. struggle and distress- covers our aim; while in this forward case, obtaintment and progress marks our gain.
            <br>&emsp;Notably, the proclivity of these interests can be so, that in our varying states, the prominence of one weighs agaisnt the other. For a basic example, if you spend your time eating and indulging, then your time spent reading and pondering will have that dragging by your side. "Almost as if your free time is committed to both; yet in each, you cannot be fully at rest, as the attention to one brings you away from the other." The experience which comes to mind actually, is when passion raises my time, so are those things of a creamy and wonderous sort perked up. Which pulls me against our dispostion to things on the alternative side to these things; at least, because our real truths are not so privy or keen on those other, so are we left in a state of stiltedness, as our passion in fact urges us towards those things which we are otherwise disposed against.
            <br>&emsp;I can say, merrily, that freedom is our life, and by that we are at liberty to elect where we go: as if our ends were in and of themselves. The thing, is that certain conditions remain beneath the more common sentences of our civil life. Which is to say, that if  we were given financial soverignty, so would our health continue its need of treatment. Forgoing that has neccessary effects, and in a way, muddies our otherwise fortune. Personally, the eveness and strenght that comes from such regards, merrits itself by those qualities and their persitence amidst our time. Consequently though, our more active and liberal interests flourish, or at least solidify themselves under such roots. And by that, I'd say that our very body holds us accountable to it's needs: and, regarding our civil freedom, so are we without suffrage to the formers demands: nor can we emmigrate from its torment. And, to compare, our mind and its own bevy of nourishments is in no way different when it comes to the constancy of its demands, and our branded station. 
            <br>&emsp;This is actually a rewarding thought, for I need not complain or compare our interests with those that have little congeniality with the roots of health. Nor our wholesome regard and sensibility at that.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, in my active way, we still have rules and consideration within such a lane. Not only must we maintain and settle into those core needs, but so must we deliberate and reflect as to the fruits we wish to sprout, and thereby the means in which we'd produce them.
            <br>&emsp;In our own case, the timidity to apply ourselves in that far latter, is the grueling subtelty that pulls at our time. As withut that clear resolve, so are we left without the gains and or momentum of a forward motion, and alongside this the contentment and committment to live in such a kind and particular way runs out, as the pull from ahead slackens our foundation. With all to much experience I've noticed that this softening effect hurries me to forwardly respond; yet by that, we are either brought so through things which rile our passions -which are themselves sirens to our fiddiling ways- or we simply elect something as our choice for choice sake, and hastly run about: as if only to proceed. These leave me in nothing short of a depleted state, and eventually one whose ultimate stalement brings our suitabilities into a resting  state -by virtue of our brazen work- which, in effect, holds us back from the very progress and paces I relished making.
            <br>&emsp;The question for me then, is why are we falling back into states which draw a hastened response? I recognize the curse of the cycle, but my concern is the effect which iniates it. And I dont know explicitly, for in one sense, our tactics within our core amends is clearly off; but so might our strategy by equally off tiltered; whereby the amount of room to slip up is itself smaller. I'd say on the general end, that our life holds no dear regard. And in a similar way as we quote ourselves by the desires associated with our inner needs, so are we lacking in the similarly basic turths when it comes to family, society, religion and death. We spend so much time giving these the benefit of the doubt, or at least we dont conclude anything regarding them. Its as if the grammar of our lifes is so unset, that we cant quite say if anything we spell is correct; and by virtue of that, in other words, it is hard to committ to anything when the basis of your resolve has no syntax, or characters at that. And secondly, regarding the way we treat the life we've deemed acceptable, we still aren't perfect at that; as although we've made solid amends to remedy crucial oversights, so are we more or less subject to the way the times were before. This is circumstantial surely, but so are we are not respecting that, at least in terms of our needs amidst the lower stock (of that which we've admitted is important). And although we are doing fine, and our strategy may hold the ultimate concern, so are we living quite passively, if not ill-deliberately, in whichever strategy we have. It is true that without a general view of life which is proper, and amended to at least, then your tactics can only go so far, and remain consistent at that. But so can we do better, even if that meant we gave more time to overdue concerns. That is its own discussion, as is the solidity of our lives. But so ought we moderately proceed. "For frugality and being economical is more of a sense, whether your accounts are settled and flowing, or if your in debt, and shifting things around."

            Dewscribing the truth is quite a hard thing to do. In that though, we are left with our common selves, which, oddly, measures up upon some thought, to the edge of what that truth is. I use the word 'description' then with much explicitness, for the trouble is not in the intuition of what is in fact true, but in saying it. This indeed comes from self regard, or at least the recognition of who we are and how things appear in our tightest state. By that, we are not driven to anything but the plain admittence of our physical mind, and our otherwise composition of matter and their output of words. Behaviour and the underlying neurology best explain this, and by that, our speech and reflection fit; that is, as the sun cam together by the swirling massess of hydgrogen, and packed together of her debris is earth and all the microbial fuzz, so is our entire make up a mere progress of that. This seems fair, and in more than one way, is sound in both the entity and description. 
            <br>&emsp;As I said though, acting with what seems relevant, fairs much ease in deliberation, as I have no question of the reason or place in which I'd proceed. Only, when I do think of what is true, or at least affirm the basis for which my common actions rung, I am all to inconsistent in actually stating so. I suggest, consider and define, and as I just did, assign (or identify), but in this mix of meddling and or definite claims, I faulter, or at least I am all to familiar with an absent of thought and explicity. That is, we regard the irelevance of things beyond the real question of entirety; and by that, despite our reproach, we hold our personl makeup as nothing special, but a configuration like all others. Our even paces give us the ease to address things as so. But so in that admittence, and our further coloring of the rules and or reasons which govern our locality and content, the basis dissolves away. Which, as I've come to known, or can consider, is that if the nature of such principles is not one that compares to the lineage of judgement or salvation, then not much is really worth our regard. It is like worrying about the current of a stream, and where you will go when on it; when in fact, recognizing that there is one and your place is one it, bears an indifference to the fact that wherever you go, the stream will take you: and that this is true, by the nature of the stream. Sensibility would ascribe that you just be then, while the percieved truth of the matter is not one that holds you under much account: as the one who'd be judging affords nothing more than the impression onto you, or at least conditioning; and, accordingly, your response is one which cant help but align, or at least get comfortable doing so. Moreover, the ends of the stream percieved by those who have settled into a state of merry rowing, is not one in which waterfalls seem perilous, or a dark lagoon as an alarm. Whether the currents are rapid and rough, so is there nothing but your resitance to rowing, which excites any real concern. For in truth, is that upon your merry row, the end which is known is a state of nothing; as if the stream will continue while your drift away. "And such a state is not so unpleasant to one who is calm enough to see it."

            I dont know why the description of providence and rest is required? It doesnt change how we pay our taxes, nor is it neccessary that we warrant the benefits of a friend.
            <br>&emsp;I think what has happened, at least with the notion that the basics of our life is off, is that the past holds not but lineage, and within that a broader substance than what is current. Only, the contemporary view holds more credit than those from antiquity; yet, resolving to it feels off, as the immaturity of it leaves it exposed to elements which the other side clearly addresses (however wrong); and at the very least, you have less to address yourself. In that, you are outside the commplacency of mindless folks and those of a poor yet severely resolute kind. Your alone onto this accurate path. 
            <br>&emsp;Part of oour reflections then, or regards, is how what the subjects of such route entail, are in need of definitions, as to not be but the idea which this path remarks, but its substancte. For we ultimately are left in this state which is all to apprehensvie to advance; but fetters as our suspended state no longer tilts forward, and theres nothing to hold us from falling back. The negative expereince which arises holds me to the count, of giving our post a more clear direction. For any path your on becomes easier to amend, as the actions which the fruits of such path promise, become easier to achieve as your steps bring you closer to it. "As with any skill or trade." 
            <br>&emsp;I remark though, that even in our triumphant place, we are but held by the principle truths in which our placement's set. By that, we are not so solid as to have cemented the merrits or reason of such place; but the natural efficacy of it comes from the inherient sensibility in which said truths are founded. Within that common yet lush state, I see that what is going on around me, is a realm which is common in the most general ways, but therein limited by the expected edges of those who are not so deliberate. While, on the outside, sits those who are deliberate, yet of that there is not much more than the roots of theism and philosophy. Plato and Aristotle hold one, while Christ and the explicit reasoning of the supreme hold the other. These are old however, and their merrits continue to wain. At least, their additions are not really present within the current realm, and by that, those who even add the modern discovery, do so on foundations which are not in themselves modern. Besides Chomsky and his developments of language, there is far from any remarkable thought. There is no Hegel or Kant in this day, nor is Nitzche, Hume, Rousseua or Spinoza present. There are humors which compare to those, but nothing so vastly and intelligently marshalled. Our own merrits even dont amount to what those produced; as we are but on a road that is based on accuracy; yet of our validity in doing so, or success that is, and the basis for our direction at that, is at most in a maturing state. 
            <br>&emsp;I feel thus alone, as none are asking questions, but saying nothing, heeding the voice of others, or building on what is at this point ancient. The simplicity though of what we wish to say is such, that our charter is not one where all must be reinvented, but refined. The questions of those before us was not ill placed, but the approach held to much formalitiy and measures for judgement that the reality of the world in which it thought to describe could respect. This may be a fine critique, but is in no way a correction; that is, we hold no certain truth by which there own is measured against. But I say, that all those who we'd deem rational, hold no legitimate concepts or actuality (of what they reason as possible) on the basis of how the world's currently known. I dont have much vivacity in temrs of logic, but I do have the sense that A) a premise needs to be legitimized itself before the use of it amongst other premises can produce anything more than valid: as we wish the most for something sound, and B) that of the reasoning which one has, and the grandeur in which its maxims flourish about, holds no ultimate sway when the existence that those basics refer to in terms of actuality in which there core reasoning means to explain, is baseless by the neccessary reproach within the present model. 
            <br>&emsp;In short, space is not itself a void, nor is the notably uncertain effect of gravity without a associate who is known to an even lesser degree. That former namely, but including those  latter two, makes the objects and concepts regarding all things appropraite to the apparent existence -to us that is- holds no definite identity or way in which we can theorize a priori for. As, for instance, a bachelor is surely one who is not married, and before confimring whether dave is one or not -and his according situtaion- if we know he is a bachelor, then we know by definition that is not married; for whether we confirmed it or not, we'd know that the status of his marriage would make what he is so. By that, all is possible in fact, but so does the latter come by the givens that the former supposes. Only, a bachelor is a man, and a man is a configuration of matter, which itself holds material origins. And if identification of matter is itself unknown, then how can we principally declare what a bachelor is. For we rest so easily on existence being what it may, but doing so in a way that our logic can align with. "Again, on the basis of possibility." But how can we suitably known what our presumption would offer, that is, how could we rely on the possibility of something, when no thing is known. We say, that if such and such happens, then so will this amount; but if things in themselves are beyond our definition, then what strenght is there in what we suppose. One might say that exprience rings the bill, or at least by virtue of terms derviced from common occurences, we can still say that some fact will fit, or be irrelevant. My point, is find me something which is not in association within this limited domain; find my a concept, or term that is, which has its derived presumptions from something other than the domain of unidentified things? Typically logic breaks down into characters, which are themselves sufficient without the prescence of things. "Mathematics works this way in some sense." And perhaps all this does is render us in an imperfect doubt; for we may know how anything would be in any given case, but never are we sure what a thing is. If this is so, then we are best to live another way, for we are indeed the ones who are skeptical. But so does this run in contrast to the given desire and ends which other's maxims are established towards. And fairly, if one is more appropraite then so ought we amend to its lane. 
            <br>&emsp;What I test upon you is in the avoidance of seeing something as uncomparable to your mind, and by that, if all things were in doubt, that as your hand and heartbeat would be, so would your facutlites of the mind and its products be too. There is no retreat into a thing which is ultimately so. There is nothing if the present of any thing is in doubt; for we can at least be sure when no thing is known, that nothing is present.
            <br>&emsp;What I believe, is that the truth lies in that, and is more pleasant and aptable then the sweetest fruits of a definite (and commonly sold as non ending) existence. 
            <br>&emsp;What nothing is though holds an interesting sway. For a rock is quite different than the purest void. And, at the very least, on the simplest scale even, there are varying atoms. And the question, is if space itself is not barren, and all things atomic are mere extensions of that, or accompanyments at least, then where do we in fact stand, as a homogenously sourced batch of things, by which the root (being something, as perceived) is in fact nothing? At least, how is the nature of matter and cheese what it is as something farily deemed something, when nothing is in fact all there is to know? Is the void sucking us in? Are we flowing out? Or maybe our view of the void is to bent on the mistakenly viewed emptiness, which itself is but an abscence amidst of a mold, or a plate we'll say; where the void is barren, in that it is not a mold which something is simply not present, or inhabiting. Truly a delicate question, as the vocabulalry holds the attributes of both a skeptical and physical kind. But in that way I dont mind, as I am simply unadorned with any support, as to remain questionable of our existence but all while remaining as I ostensibly am, all while were seperate to the inaccurate neccessity of thing's prescence, and the presumptuous givens of what is in fact not pricnipal -and thus an appropraite maxim- all under the misplaced wish, and assumed preference of ends that are in accord to existence; when the truth, is that either existence is not so and thus the ends derived from such are misplaced, or, that if there is a kind of existence, that the nature of that amidst the vastness of space holds no neccessary sway for an end which is of peace: and in that, I say that nothing else is needed for my place in existence to be favorable in the way that its natural. "for who would have peace, and effectively forever so, and think that a nature ordained and privilaged for that, was poor, off, wrong, and otherwise the remark of heretical and or mean thinking. I think all thinking of a provident and or solidified sort (regarding existence) seeks such end anyway. And all it has failed to do is see that nature amidst her unsolid ways, still offers us that. For the abscence of mind is not worth being apprehsneive about, when the nature of it is more or less the same (without it) in existence or without. For you are in effect with not: and thus peace is yours for all time: and effeacaitvley nothing other when time ends."

        <div id="termsforsoil">
            I may ultiamtely have a final position, which is itself appropriately absolute, but generally we remain on a route of skepticism.
            <br>&emsp;Foremost, is this the fact due to the very nature of things which we seek to inquire. For starters, the basis by which reasoning comes from, in terms of ideas at least, holds no reputable sway when it comes to the reality of things. It is not that we are soley mistaken, and have concieved of things different than what they are, but that such measure of what things, is unknonw; and by that, no premise can really be laid, for not space, origins or time can be mentioned as concepts within the complex of reasoning, for these things are, more or less, clearly of existence: and in that unknown. That is a crucial thing at least.
            <br>&emsp;Secondly regards a bevy of mental limits, whereby our natural bandwidth cant simply comprehend the most complex things. By that though, we merely need terminology that best describes the properties of things; for in that, we can better propse what the base layer is, and otherwise how it moves and comes to be. The point here compares to that almighty question of soul and substance, or, in a modern sense, the line between void and nothing. On top of that, is the actual regards for the swooshes, and in other words innate propensity for movment by these finest strands. For, one of the core issues of physics, as I see it, is how common matter acts the way it does, but unclearly from a source (which itself is equally unknown). This brings the element of mind and will, as if the soul which matter rests on urges it; and by the movements of that, mechanics arrive. Yet, albeit fair and plausible that there is some sort of urging basis, that the actually twists and twirls at levels inferior to particles, is quite ill defined. And my point, is that if you consider a body of water, and how its surface holds the choppiness of waves, and below there swoons the currents and tides, that with such common sentiments at our disposal, we can better regard how all layers of matter act; at least, if we have more refined and bolstering notions that reflected different temeprs of motion, so would we have more delicate terms to describe the equally delicate layers.
            <br>&emsp;For me, that is what skepticism is, in that we are without confidence and amends to a truth which our doubts confer. But, to that limit which our suscpions at best concern, so is the edge by which things are clearly known in need of our own descriptive ability for things at that edge. For it is one thing to presume a soul, or urging layer, by which all matter settles upon -and in fact originates. But, if the distance in which our regards are placed concerning the  edge of that basis to the point of where matter begins, is increasingly far from such edge, then our idea of matter and the basis will be off. That is all I seek to do, is push what is known against our suppositions. And, interestingly, is that as we make this advance, that the intuition of the base becomes clear; or at least an idea of it starts to form; and, such notion is one that seems to govern what our knowledge (or matter) is derived from. In other words, the further we press existence against the possibility of it, so does the actuality of it become a source in itself. "Whereby providence holds no more trace, or need."
            <br>&emsp;For me, the most usefull element of our doubts comes into play. And that has to do with how we identify things. 
            <br>&emsp;Lets bring this and the prior notion together. There is an edge, of atoms well say, and within those lies the soul source; which, to reference Leibniz, urges, or initiates the atoms to move as they do, who upon their mutual interactions with eachother, produce effects of a mechanical sort. And again, we assume this edge, or soul rather, as the motion of matter seems impossible to explain without something to begin it. Only, we have made a crucial error in this. One that remarks that limit of concepts due to our limit of understanding the matter they reflect. Only, in this case, the general notion is that things which are labelled ostensively, are not entities in their own right. As concepts they may be, as of things and their relevance to us, so are the mechanics (so to speak) clear and thus identifiable. Yet, as things, they are unknown on the basis of what any thing is. And by that, we have the peculiar idea of ostentation, which is to say that green paint is (upon inspection) blue and yellow paint together. As an idea, or subject as we say, green paint is, or green at that; but as paint, it is really just a mix of blue and yellow; and by that, there is no entity which we'd describe as green paint. It is more or less an illusion in a practical sense. Even then, is there blue and yellow paint? For upon inspection, it is not so that these are made of other mixtures. Only, if we look beyond the sentiment of paint, we'd find that what makes the blue blue, and yellow yellow, is the configuration of atoms, and the way that light bounces of that as to create a blue and yellow effect. "Which, to reiterate, combines together to create the appearence of green: but not even of a configuraiton which is anything more than the reflections of the structure of blue and yellow." 
            <br>&emsp;My point, which to be clear does not end here, is that as green is not so, for it is in actuality blue and yellow, so are each of those  latter really a batch of atoms. In terms of green not being so, this is very much an illusion on the forefront layer. Just as flour, water and yeast subject to heat, creates the crustiness of bread. But of those ingrediants, or parts -which, together, are but altered from heat- so are the components of that made of components themselves. And by that, bread is but a mixture of the atoms (whose configuration) we call flour and yeast. Even heat, in a molecular sense, is but a transfer of energy (in a vibrational sense) to those vibrations within the atom. And my point, which again is not done, is that as bread is ostensivley heated up flour and yeast, so is flour ostensively molecules of glucose, which are themselves adjoined atoms of carbon and oxygen; and these, are but bundles of protons and surrounding electrons; and that former at least, is a bundle of quarks. And I say with great skepticism, what are quarks ostensively; and in other words, what blue and yellow paints make the green of quarks so? The notion of space comes into play, and the fair inquiry regarding dark matter. But these are more like supports to our plea of being skeptical: for of the soul which we suppose, be it the source of bread, atoms or particles, so is the thing which it is the basis for unknown. 
            <br>&emsp;And, as our core address, that as we further define what that thing is, or at least what lies on the side of matter at the edge of it and soul, that such refinement and inquiry would perhaps render the idea of 'soul' mute. And that because this line by which the true parts of things comes to be fits within the mystery of barreness and abscence, that the former may in fact be nature, while the latter and its occasioanl residents, may be but incomplelety, or at least unsolidiy destined, as their source and ends are acquited and in accords, to the void in which their aligned. 
            <br>&emsp;That notion, of space and its residents acting how they do amongst nothing (or the void) is the goal of our description. For even if all was in fact real and solid, contained, how could there be any place where something was not? Where is that edge, and if so, how is it that there is a difference of sides? Would the tide of nothing not wash the sands of the other away? And in that sense, we need a better picture of what entirety could be; for as I see it, it is really our ideas and concepts which identify things only ostensively, and rear the all to common conundrum of what the unviverse is expanding into; or at least, if the complex of things was so, then where does it lie in? And our notion of ostentation is such, that without the proper terms of doubt, then we may confuse the void in which the mould (or floor) of things is held, as a location itself. And that, if we then say, 'well, of that floor, its the soul which acts as the source of that: the basis for the empty plate'. And all I would say, is that we need a compliment to that certain something, in that the existence which we deem sourced from the soul, or mistaken as being within something also existent, that 'existence' may be something else, and not entirely solid and real as we suppose: and my arguemtn for that, is that the merrits for beleiving otherwise comes on the fact that soul (or infinity) are but presumed beginnigns for the existence that we believe is so: yet, if that existence is really not, then would the void of soul and infinity not fit that? Could there be not soul or inifinity if existence was really not? And against your impression that it clearly is, I say show me, define it for me, tell me, 'when space is something itself, or at least not void', that your identity of things is so? For if space is equally something as a rock, then the greatest mistake is made, in thinking that existence (or things) is everywhere, for where is space not? But I believe that we have floundered into the gravest error: for my belief, is that if something is deemed to be everywhere, then where could nothing (or the void) ever be. And in that, at least, removes any possibility of a soul (or void), definitivey. But I indeed have no solidity of regard beyond this point, and must atually amend from this principles whihc I lay, as opposed to explaining: for, in practice, it is a back and forth of mistakes, made along the lines of our seeming to forget, or mistakenly assume that our conclusion of reality or not is wrong. And in that, I must identify that which is not knonw, to ask more questions about it. "for it is harder to say that an undefined thing does not exist than that it does. And saying that a definied thing does exist holds more credibility than that it does not (for it is defined). ANd speaking about that first point, is what is hard to know, but what our skepticism suggests: as all things other act as though things are defined, when they are not: and, through inquiry -being the adavnce amidst doubt- we move on. But not from here, as my brain is broken."

        <div id="ourvalidity">
            I think that part of our discontent likely comes from the confusion of what our efforts are for. You see, the less I arrange our interests towards that which promises travel and friends, so do those outputs wain. And in effect, I cannot see them, as my effort doesnt excite me with their future prescence. 
            <br>&emsp;This is fine more or less, nor are the common bounds of our time exempt from these coming about. Only, in our current way, we wish to write; yet, such an interest is one of a natural gait, as opposed to finishing something. There are projects that I do, and in a way, they make me happy and solid -which itself confers literal and or percieved excitement. 
            <br>&emsp;But as we settle, or at least stop in moments of rest, so do those industrious paces wain; and their results seemingly follow. 
            <br>&emsp;This is fine though, as the flow of my life best describes our needs and interests. For the sun is high or covered, but so do we walk, move in the moring, eat appropriately through the early and mid day;and then we write alongside this, work a little perhaps, or play a game and watch a show. And this keeps going on and on, and generally with a wholesome heart and smile. 
            <br>&emsp;I only think that our forward efforts treat us nothing more than their inovlvment; and at least, their direct output is but promising, but never so rewarding. When we are left to ourselves then and our common pace, so is there not much we are obliged to which would give us a similar outlook. And this is fine, preffered even. For amongst our clarity, so is our happiness amidst others and the average time of touring a fair scale by which our time should be judged against. There are things I would like to do, and generally are approach there is coming out. But I generally live as though there is not much to gain, or anything which we are wrong to be doing, or avoiding at that. Theres so much buisness out there in the world, that acting as though you actions are respecting the complixity of that is poor; and if you did understand it, then you wouldnt feel so bad.
            <br>&emsp;Where were left though is a state of pure liberty. And perhaps, with fairness, in that which comforts this doesnt guarentee is not so barring of those comforts, but rather they have their particular grooves to come along, we are otherwise set amongst our ways, whereby time is not measured in rotating periods or days, but what is right now and proceeding. In that, there are things we know, and some things we could expect. But outside the way we spend our time, there is not much else but which we cling on to as to remedy what the lack of the former produces.
            <br>&emsp;In one way or the other, I am not interested in taking for granted the interests that we have. I wish to establish our point of view, charter the annals of man thorugh the fragments, be vulnerable and open in our approach of intimacy, and perhaps the time and confidence to progress through the toils of publishing. This is what I seek, and by most accounts, the impetus is in what we lack, as opposed to some hurdle that asks much of us to do. We just need to be ample and sharp, and let the years and our ways go on. We are fine right now; and less we make a hasty attempt, and following committment at that, so will our finer ways need to strenghten for those outer pleasures to be. Right now though, I am set in the openess of our ways, and calmly as the novel needs and anxious judgements from others is gone. All I need to do is procceed. And by that, establish the core of that: remarking upon it as if truly were our lane. And, as per all ends and their required task, so can we reflect on that, and marshal ourselves in a way that suitable. For, if our aim with respect to some profession, then our itinerary is most important; and within our actual employment, so would the needs of that seal our respect. When it comes to our interests though, they are very much of activity. As I see that writing and reading are at the heart of it, so ought our response be with respect to the vitality that they seek. And thankfully, or happily rather, I do this, for in that regal path, we earn the stability to do such things; but amidst this we earn the casual favor of leisure and rest. Moreover, as we generally advance in this vital way, so do the refinements of that offer us an innately preferred way to be. For doing yoga and things of that refined sort bear me a natural means of persitence, as our passive time even beenfits from us better sitting on the floor.
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps at the end of the day our fragments and outward invovlements are mere occupations; and merrited so on the basis of us needing to be occupied. Perhaps if we were much more forward and direct, as if our heartflet inerests held some immediacy, then we'd need these not. I dont think this neccessary though. For I invested in our scooter, some books, and things of the sort; and beyond our fear of losing money, the task of discernment was no toil. Similarly, producing more shorts, setting up a profile, or currating the means for publishing, are but simple tasks, despite their unknown end. I only mean, that as we stretch and run, and write, read and play alongside this, and do some chores at that, that taking the steps for those occupations is not so different; and at that, as the steps we take in our dearest ways comes naturally and gradually as our core is steadied, so do those other steps. For each, we need not worry, nor ought we press ourselves as if finihsihng is our claim. The project themselves are of their own accord, and what they require is one thing; but their is no time pressing on us; and by that, ought they be interests like all others, and come out without scarring us, through the field in which all interests are facilitated. They are great in there own way, but are substanital only as much as we put in. And considering their nature and our lack of confusion for what they should procurre in terms of place, holds no enormous weight on me to become something through those. I already am, steady and clear. These things are akin to chores, and otherwise resemble our daily lives and respect, whereby the percieved course of our lives amidst our civil lane is respected. And to those occupations you can treat as if they were that. But lets not confuse their purpose as bringing us out into that realm full and mightily. They are no produced in that way to begin with. Time and patinece can offer rewards, but these are elements on top of me, who is fine and happy to be where we are, and blossoming. Our fragments is important, in a way thats comparable to our website and network. And publishing and intimacy seem worthwhile; and at least, our means to procurre them is similar to our means to acquire work and stead. They are not so clear and cut as employment, but the steps required are commparable; and by that, of these richer rewards we can only try. And we have our sweets regardless.
            <br>&emsp;I think we just need to return to me, and focus on our being; as most things, be it personal or outward, come to fruition when you are well. And I know that not all needs to be perfect; or at least, it is our choice to offer effort which limits what we do, rather than being mistaken in that those things dear require an abandoment of those outer things. Emails and time is all thats required. And regarding passion, no matter; and in terms of its real good (as something is external), so is it the sun: preferable when up, but not barren while the moon runs high. And if the sky is covered, so are true to our ways.
            <br>&emsp;I see that you are skeptical, and by that we are not looking to prove, but find. By that, we have our anwser, and at any rate, can hopefully come at our other curisoities with a firmer grasp, and thus approach them out of desire, rather than a need for ceratinty or passion. And generally, this way is a remark of our right character, or one which is lush and robust. "For asking questions draws from me the most." In that though, there isnt much which I can complain when our treatment is such a character; as what comes naturally to it is swell, and in a way the driving force of our amends; but so to can you quell any uncertainty or stress, when the treats of being said person is fine innately. This is where the lure of leisure comes in, and that of people and family. For I seek not, frett little, and otherwise find meager means to advance ourselves advantageously. But I worry little about gaining that, in that it comes from desire and our ease of being vulnerable, of trying: travel holds no passion, nor that of friends. Lets be ourselves then. Or at least, reflect upon what it means to be that. And qualify yourself on what it means to be so simple, and fear not about judgement. We will leave if being ourselves runs antagonist to others hope of control.

            So the basics are what give you a smooth life, in that the paces of it are withut trouble and pleasant. Then, as time goes on and this solidity of your remains, you find interests which reflect said grounds. Such interests then require their own deliberation or care. While, tending to the basics is more about sensibility and the refinements of that. While occupations and industry holds constructive regards: as the prior is about how you are, while the latter is about something your actually making.
            <br>&emsp;The question, is what happens when your familiar enough, or disposed atleast, to those basics, but begin to slip? If you are in fact engaged with higher efforts, what about those cracks below? As I'd put it, the soil is sometimes dry or full of holes, or too compact at that. While those further efforts have their own twists and binds; but, as I have found at least, that the driving factor for how we knot ourselves around such ends, is by the steadyness below. In retrospect, we've realized that the basics are all we need, for we are engendered with rational joy. But so are these things, seeing as their hearty in effort, can become bound for something other than our participation, when in fact the grounds which they sit on are unsettled. These projects then become as such, rather than activities; and our occupation is no longer a kind of effort but a profession, or at least an anwser to that which would respond to our core slump.
            <br>&emsp;This is the path we must tread though. For the basics are not so forgone, nor our sensibilities far off -and without room for ample improvment- when it comes to tightening loose ends. Nor, at any rate, ought we tremble upon our higher efforts, if in fact we let go of the reigns. Evidently the roughness which we'd tend to is already felt in the constricted promises from those higher efforts; and thus reproaching from those will see those promsies untended, but in need. But so can our dryed out ways be attended to immediatley, and by that the flarred up stakes will remove themselves. Moreover, we learn, about who we really are and whats important. And, as it were, the world in which we think was on offer for those hasty efforts, and otherwise the apprehension of missing out or feeling scrutiny about not meeting that 'oppertune way', not only looses its harsh glare, but encourages understanding by us; as if we truly were occupied and engaged, but through a world whos nature (we further understood) was in harmony with our steady intent. In that, the holes which we develop beneath, reaffirms the even grounds which are in truth fine and favorable: and our view of the world comes to be in a way which is congruent to that: at least, what we find favorable and true, is in line with the way the world really is: and such a way is not, or ever is, in the complexion that our haste and di-ease imagines (or commends).

        <div id="timesbetter">
            I think when I consider success, it is not so much about what I get, but what I achieve; which, comapred to the actual profits of accomplishment, moreso remarks the actual triumph in the activity. For instance, I may achieve a new role at a job, and in that earn more money; and the money may be something you earn in its own right, but really it is what you can spend it on. By that, this promotion and the nature of its promise may spark in you the excitement for what such liberties will bring.
            <br>&emsp;Yet, in that, there is a scale called reason, whereby my measure for rewards is garnered by sensibility and due regard. This is important in times when success seems so appealling, but of a kind which would offer things that could remedy whats lacking. This to me is poor, as times where I am solid draw me to things which treat me to less mitigtaing ends, but flourishing ones. "Removing negativity compared to furthering yourself positively."
            <br>&emsp;I would say though, that our approach to considering success can include those things of a more thirlling and comfortable sort. But, whereas it may seem fair to start with those ends in mind, and by virtue of our oppertunity 'to do the most we can', we may dream further in terms of those ends. Yet, I would say that it makes more sense to start with what you have, and consider the success in front of you: be it near and present, or that which you can see coming. By virtue of that, we will be more clear and kept to the scenario that we have, and not linger off into fantasies which in fact reflect what we'd hope for beyond our current stead. Instead, with a requisite sensibility to your current condition and the peace which follows, we can see success as something which is coming out and as an addition to our steady self. It seems that our dreams otherwise come from a self which is fleeing, or unable to rest in place: and that seems wrong in both the heart of the issue, but also the evident destination in which you'd reach, and then be in need of rest there. Perhaps theres a generous capactity to life, wherein you gradually recieve things and find it naturally easier to be in place, but of fortune as compared to strict fortitude. I would say though, that waiting for things to be easy in order to be at peace, seems both unneccessary as well as risky, as until that point where fortune bears rest to you, further actions which come from the prior discontent may cause conseqeunces of their own; or, at least, you may find contrary proclivities to the rest which you really seek.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, I am not saying that we are without need for discipline; for by oppertunity or impression, we see success around. But I find inherintly, that certain givens of a pivotal sort, keep me sequestered in the land of virtue and stability (upon their amends). Things that grow from here may be less explicity in there need as is the case for efforts of a promising comfort; but so does that core dispostion lean me towards the grooves of the former. And, perhaps to my overall point, that as one would have the peace and ability to address those more wholesome extensions, so could we address those of success: but from us, as stated.
            <br>&emsp;By that, I see that our content creation is coming along. Yet, I cant help but feel jealous; which is not to say envy, as I am quite pleased with our place and sincerity, and thus feel no need to bring others down. Yet, I look at them, some at least, and think, 'will I ever have that, are my efforts set for such ends? Are we confused on our path, in terms of what it will give?'. But none of this bothers me quite readily. There is perhaps excitment that naturally comes from doing something; and perhaps, seeing others of the same kind and their shine, makes me see the potential for us to reach the shame. In that though, our comparions can wear upon us, as our current stead fails under the light of the other. Progress does come, and in those states our pace affirms the end  of our course. Yet, when we arent making such evident gains, then we feel still, and in effect far away from those ends I seek. 
            <br>&emsp;This comapres to what we were saying, that as I generally ought to be sensible, and in that, and from the steadying effect, arrange and see things ahead from the point of me; that, equally, ought we see and arrang the ends of our project from the point of it. Because at the heart of this we want to be happy. And when I see someone who has alot of success, it is not their ability to travel or find comfort that begrudges me, but the fair assumption that their higher status makes them happy. In that though, we see that we just want our others to care; for in that, our ideas matter and we are deemed offical: like we matter. Overall though, we just want to be happy, and the more that this expands beyond our core contentment, so are there elements of excitment and pleasure which extend from that. 
            <br>&emsp;I think that judgement plays apart to, as we feel somewhat awry at merely being pleased with our efforts, and not reimbursed for the sake of some other end. Such ends feel novel, or at least beyond the realm of need. And the quality of our time does bring me the dearest of securities, in the roots by which our cheer is made. But bringing that to light makes it so, and we are in way substantiated in our wholer efforts. But ought it be more? For I feel that none really judge you, and that in regards to their judgement, you are fine to be with enough. It is only you who are swept away from being unhappy; and in that, as I see it, is because you are in fact not so engrained or established in your dearest ways. Working to make that so comes at a price though; for in the moments of discontent, whereby the wealth of success would be welcomed, so do our amends bring us to a point which offers nothing of the sort. We may along the line be warm and pure, but so much only as our paces and will provide. Otherwise, the common medocrity of your ways will remain somewhat present: and until such ways become more substantial and able to remain full in their selves, so will your time be inconsistent.
            <br>&emsp;That is the challenge though. To remain steadfast on approach to times better; or amend otherwise to ends which are remedying to the current moments of lack. "But of which time you get on arrival, I cannot say. Or at least, what I suspect is that you would be comparably discontent, but amidst your wealth, rather than rags. It is better to be cheerfull and in the reigns of the latter; and through this more personal discernment, and suitable amends at least, can such poverty become more amicable: all while coming from, centering around, and furhtering the range of your cheer. And who would care for any status of claim, if it did not hold such quality. Away with those boring Kingships."

            As an example, I asked someone whether I should move to the coast or the interior. They offered their reply, and I muddled over what they said. A short while later I was with some friends and I said, 'Man, I still don't know what to do, coast or inland!. My friend consoled me, telling me that it would be all right. I went on though, saying that I was not clear on the choices. Sensing I was frustrated, and having their own peck of gruff over our stirring, they explained that it was simple, inland or coast, thats all. "Theres no need to be overwhelmened," that claimed, the picks are laid out in front of.
            <br>&emsp;For me, this issue raises its head all to common. That being said, whereas in the past certain scenarios required a particular response, as in the case of our parents reprehending me, or at least demanding attention over our mistake, my reply was simply 'I understand'; while in this case, the response which best addressess my concern, is one of special clarity, whereby I'd say, 'I know what the options are, I am just not sure what each amounts to. Or better yet, when it comes to each and their particualr elements -the facts regarding them if you will- of them I am unsure'. 
            <br>&emsp;It is as if I said I wished to either buy a home up north or down south, but in my discernment I knew not the price. Better yet, if someone offered insight, or an oppertunity we'll say, as to choose one of those homes, still, would my decision find itself dragged by the lack of known price.
            <br>&emsp;And perhaps overall my gravest gripe with society is in regards to their all to common narrow mindedness, whereby the sides of an issue, or parts of a concer, are given details in terms of the according positions, but rarely to any depth in the actual members themselves. Were all to clear on who is involved with things, or that a certain event happened; but we know not where the opponents stand, in terms of their scenario amidst other scenarios; and regarding events, we see and react to one, but know not its place amidst others. And by that comes the all to painstaking reality of significance, which is to say, that a single death throughout the annals of time would hold warrant of concern and amends: but so is this relatively insubstantial. And by my view, there is no common sense as to the difference between these two.
            <br>&emsp;I know not what to say, as the whole world, or its elements at least, waiver to some extent under such consideration. But I can say, for instance, that regarding the quality of our time, that most things are signifianct; and that, for simplicity sake, we may divulge certain sectors within the domain of all our efforts, and by that hold the realms of leisure, industry, liberty and claim as relevant to us; and although the fruits of each are worth our time, and in that sense hold according good, so are some more substantive than others. Simply, if, across the realm of things, or other factors we'll say, that a particular memebr causes instability to others, this we will say holds contrariety, as it is in opposition to itself. With only this in mind, we can see that the value of things is fit for according judgements; as it is most certaintly true that our lives hold many elements, and perhaps even more when we consider what we are at our wills to achieve. And simply, I've recieved no impression outside of those long gone, who've given any comparable regard to things on the whole, nor, in our modern times, an ounce of discernment regarding the particular things relevant to us today.
            <br>&emsp;By that, I stand by Plutarch and Socrates, nor has Ruskin or Hume left the side of my heart and writing hand. But in our present case, which, historically, is one of vastness and variety, so is there little but the ignorance and naieveties born from the eras before us. "In a word, theres not even a sentiment of reason or consistency, nor any contemporary judgement." 
            <br>&emsp;At the end of the day, I stand as a man by myself, and am in no ways apathetic to our position outside the norms of the world. In that, I have grown to respect; nor have suitable means to find comfort and success left their climbing pace. Moreover, I would best describe myself as a subject who upholds their duty as such, but does so by the more focused efforts within solitude, and the natural felicity and kindredness that comes out. "Whether I disagree with other men, or another man, so would I die for them. Not without purpose mind you, nor am I so void of myself as to be sucked in by snetiment. But so, to those norms which seem off, or at least inconvineent to our ordinary self, I listen: and where it counts for those of all sorts, so do I act then -and respect those of times where such reality was more common." All I would say, is that we live within the world: yet, within that is housed the world of men. And again, I am one, nor am I void of its detriments and proclivitiy. But I do prefer, and at least find virtue and favor, in the unmitigated lands around. In this, I see others within the state, who know all but anything; yet, with opinions and flare they correspond, or at least flaunt accordingly. This is strange, as if I were looking into the looking glass, or at least was stairing at the nature of men from further back, while those further in held such tight glares, that they fell forward into what is in practically a close point by that edge. In this however, I feel my task, for without any sense of the world I am both ignorant and lost; yet, with  all my repraoch and ability, I am not like everyone else ticked off. All I have is the nature of the world and its evidence around me; while they hold what amount to gossip and gross impressions. Moreover, to those even more savy then me, do their accounts get tangled up in the knots of significance, whereby even the most relatively unimpactful thing gets perceived as rot. I, on the other hand, have a general knowledge which trails all the back to beginnings of time; proceeding to stars, geology, the beginnings of mammals and man, so, with even more prevlance, do I know the charters of the oldest world, antiquity, feudal times and the liberty were in now, that even if someone specialixed in such fairs, would hold so little merrit less the breadht of their wares was not accounted for in an impression of something particular. And by that, I see most people, young and old, with a very small scale: nor any short amount of dopes and pundants, who (in their capactieis) use it. 
            <br>&emsp;But where am I then, with all our far back views, and to a realm that lies, specifically past what most know and see, and generally beyond the immaturity of even adult men? I can say, that I know; at least, of what I know is essential to regard, as if parts of a mold, am I clear. But, where I stand then, is in filling out those spots, as to not be merely reproached and wise, but known, or defined at least. 
            <br>&emsp;For as I'd put it, the issues of the world is one of impressions; and by that, it seems that the words of CNN and the pulpit bear us impressions of gratuitous kind. In that, as a man, I recognize that we are not so exempt, depsite our content; for the world were in goes on to our concer, or direct effect. Our impact may be little, but we are not simply foreigners of another country, and thus without worry. My point, is that as much as I am fine and pure, then so will the mummblings of others not interfere; for I may in fact permit myself to be a man occupied with his will; and shouldering that with a deliberate approach to our duty, is a mere sensibility to the problems the world actually has, and the grant from those trying to solve it: which I then recieve. Only, if I am not so happy, for whichever reason, then the undefined parts of our mind will yeild to gravity, and implode. Restlessness is born here, as is a far reporach from the world. That is the place for cynics though; but I also wish to be a man. Of such recgonition though, I suspect and more or less see, that we are at the point where fingertips are required: which, in effect, speaks to the additions which could come, but also the more important note, of what your adding to. "And to all those rumbling about, with our own strenght I care not, nor am I without such vision: for in our grounds, were sprouting, and wisely too: and, in short, the turth which we've identified has pulled me forth, and served as a web to get wrapped around: nor is my steady heart aware of things which bother one who is otherwise not." Yet by that, I must let our own gratuity go: but I mustn't say that I know the nature of man: for, upon all our reckoning and dispute, have we just become: and thus from our first steps the past is so long, and thus hard to remember. "But I know that the right step which would have come from our more collected discernemnt, would produce a step which lived without such need: and as in those harsher days, where the wear kept me so aware and assessing, so has this true step brought me to a point worth respecting: I notice though that the toil is not done, as if our bones are still changing, and the muscles at that: yet, the direction and precipe of state, affords no worry or care to such ways -as if being shot felt tore us like a mere flesh wound, to which our expectation curried such delight, that we forgot to address the scrape at hand."

        <div id="soul">
            For starters, the notion of mind is tricky. As, for one, is the soul that governs all objects varied in itself? Or, as the ocean is made of water, but ripples here and bellows there (in its waves) by virtue of its collision (within itself), so might the soul be universal, but create the variations we see objectilely, by virtue of the movements of those equal pieces moving against eachother. 
            <br>&emsp;I'd add that skeptically, the notion of the soul is finite, as we are in fact negating what, beyond a contrived will, the motions and configurations of the objects we see; as, all things of the soul moving identically, does not speak clealry to any collision. The moon for instance and its effect on the seas, tears different parts, in the sense of a particular point in which our eyes see, and the narrowing lines from top to bottom as the object is approached; that the moons force pulls not only through its unexact bounds (as it is a globe, as opposed to a point), but so to the water there and that over there, that even of the exact drawing force, would the directions in which the recpients accepted this and reacted, bare them according to such force with a bearing equally different as the line of force (between the moon and point of the sea) differed. Where is this central point then for the soul and its objects? The soul is the instigator, the house of the starting will? I cant say our current suppostions permitt a base which we'd refer to the soul, but was meddled with by some outside mind; the soul, in our skeptical stance, is what we grant on the basis of our limited objectivity; but of what is on the outside of such material end -or its bases and beginning- is the realm and or hand which such will or mind is refferred to. "For at that point, we are explaining the motions of things by virtue of the souls impetus, but in our ill-clarity of that, or inquiry at least, we mistake the soul as something which the eternal mind governed, which in fact is an error in equating the soul to what is more appropriately deemed an object." We guarentee no edge, nor a creator; but if we do, we are clear on the contrivance of it all, and the arbitraty nature by which things act mechanically. The intent of the origin may be what we suppose, but so is the act of starting not revlant, or comaprable at least, to the more ostensible beginnings of mechanical force. 
            <br>&emsp;All I have are questions though, for how is there indeed a difference of souls, or variation at least? Perhaps, as I beleive in addressing so with any argument of it being neccessary -and the according mistake of defining it to objectively- that we are in fact at the point whereby the idea of the soul is poor. Our limits in mechanics may not explain themselves, nor any sounder notion that is comparable to the soul but holds more appropriate claim is present; but we can say that of the things in which our explanation means to say, so can we be clear on that. 
            <br>&emsp;Yet, I can only come from this sketpcially. The point I wish to make, is that the soul is not varied; or at least if it is, then we musn't mistake the way that it is for something which is best explained by mechanics. I seek clarity of this though, for there is the consequent view that our minds are of a differnet sort when it comes to the soul: as it the matter, or subject which our mind equates, is not merely a configuration of a the universal matter or soul, but is born of a different soul. 
            <br>&emsp;I might describe our inquiry like this. If we believe that the mind is born not of matter, or at least is of something unwordly, then equal to our interest in explaining the origin of rocks, so will we wish to explain the roots of our mind. Only, when we look at rocks, and our bones for that matter, we something hard, definite, composed of material; and be it the soul and the basic pieces who react upon its will, or a natural flow of things born of a reality which is itslef limited, so are we clear in what anwser our claim would reflect. Concerning the mind though, we because we deem it of a different nature then rocks and bone, then so do the anwsers we seek find themsevlves as such. 
            <br>&emsp;This is the crux of inquiry then, and in many ways holds us accountable as men. For by definition we are so, and not Gods who already know; for as I would declare, and burn those who deemed otherwise, that what makes us the creature we are, is in our attempt, and maturity to recognize our course as such, in asking, and doing so with accuracy and cheer at that. 
            <br>&emsp;Such a limit then, which again marks us as men, earns us the favor of defining things in the most speculative sense. However, I make a modern distinction; one of which implodes upon the very insight in what being limited means. Simply, if I see a miracle, then I'd believe that the occurence was born of God; for in that, by the rocks and birds I see, I know not much which is unnatural about that: while those walking on water or turning rocks to wine, is unnatural -super as they'd say. And what I'd propose, that on the merrits of the mind and its immateiral view and the granted case for a reality, or bend of the soul one makes such immateriality such, warrants miracles and mysteries to be seen as equally so. In other words, we may see mystical occurences as evidence of something else; but my proposal is that we merely see this as a different aspect of entirety: the comparison being the aspect which  bears things we see as normal. The point, is that in that variety, entirety is whole. "Just as man is whole and solid, but made of organs and parts."
            <br>&emsp;I belive that was muddled, but my offer is made. Do we, simply, take what we believe to be true, on the basis of what entirety is as we'd derive from evidence? Or, do we confess to knowledge that is born by confirmation, which is to say that we believe entirety to be a certain way, by which evidence confirms. For my belief, is that we deem our mind and miracles to be spiritual; but that this is so for we believe entirety to be goverend, if not at least partially as so. And in a way, our mind and miralces seem but affirmations of that: or at  least instances and things which fit the world we already suppose.
        </div>
        <div id="ofwholesandways">
            Skeptically, I look at the evidence born by objects, and decree that the explanation for such things is unknown. Moreover, as our investigations have occured, of those I can not truly identify. "For as it stands, the emptiness of space is not truly so; and by that, it is neither a void, nor strictly the layer in which we'd say 'empty'."
            <br>&emsp;In all of this though, the theory of such mysteries is left unclear. I am not a true skeptic, as I believe our understanding of things can become fully known; but as for now, where I lye in mere doubts, do I advance skeptically.
            <br>&emsp;However, in this approach it is right to presume the character in which the truth would be; and by that, at least for our own inquiries, can we say, that all and any lies within entirety. Existence to be clear is more along the lines of actuality; while possibility, or the arbitrary goverance and initation of that, is but a mere supposition. In other words, outside of what is real, lies the limitless will, who by mind or mechanism produced the seeds of existence. 
            <br>&emsp;I must be clear though, that within my reproach, and the according skeptical steps, do I merely suppose that of all things, that they either explain themselves, or are in some ways arbitrary in their origins: but within that, be it object and soul, or pure object, so entirety is all. 
            <br>&emsp;In my view, the latter notion is likley, if not possible; and because I dont know, and am thus skeptical, I offer the difference in what I know about objects and what I do not, under the supposition of the soul -or something arbitray. But my approach, as my belief and according aim reflects, is to push what is known against that supposed edge, and reach, as I conceive, a point whereby all which we see is made and goverened innateley. A mighty point does arrive, in that, more or less as we see it that objects interact via and to the effect of mechanics, and that of such relations that innately they are made, that so of this is entirety the bound of all, or domain at least; and, of such entirety, ought it be present to all there ever could and has been. "Hath possibility come from nature, and to that the outputs of real things, would such possibility still lie in the realm of being, which is to say not a void."
            <br>&emsp;On one hand then, we have the possibility that entirety is without bounds, which is to say, that off the things we see (or existence), that the roots of such is born of something eternal and infinite. That, or existence and its possibility are the same, or something of the sort; and however you'd place it, so is the possibility, or roots at least of the objects we see, limited, or un eternal as we'd otherwise see.
            <br>&emsp;If that is more or less true, as two sides to the same entire view, then I would say there are two interesting points: one being the identity of nothingness, and the error in believing otherwise by virtue of confirming what you already supposed.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, if I can define, there are those who see the world, and consider how it came to be; by that, there view of entirety is one that is derived from the outputs of it. "As if we saw a flower, and considered how it was made." While, on the other hand, there are those who suppose -heavily I'd add- how entirety is, and then see things which correspond with that, verifying their view. Miracles work both ways here, as one may have an inherint belief, then see something beyond normal and claim, 'wow, a sign, it is true!'. While on the other, by virtue of our own granted slice of supposition, we may deem apparent miracles as mere evidence which needs explaining; and by that, we may say, with some conflict between the sides of thinking, that what would cause such a miracle is so and so. This is better, though with some more thought we can see that the mix of confirmation and exploration are both knotted and maligned. Morever, as were on this note, is that, while a rock may exhibit explanations fitting for something so lifeless, that our mind and intuition may exhibit less strict properties, and thus according explanations. In this comes the odd idea of different kinds of souls, as if different seeds which bore different objects. I would say though, that this notion is quite unfounded in the develomental sense, unless one believes that there sat a layer of soul that was activated upon our minds introduction, or our being at least. This is quite odd, and whithering in its merrits.
            <br>&emsp;Secondly, and most hard to define, is the idea that all may not in actuality be so, and is in fact a birth from nothing struggling to be; and by that, the movement we'd deem forward and thus intial to our current advance, is more like a recession; which itself, as a form of magnirutde, or relative motion at least (being away in some sense), births a trajectory that the laws of physics which we know could work from. On one hand, is that origin, which is comparable to quicksand and a stake used to prevent motion; but in that resistance lies the friction that motion originates from. That, or nothing is not happy to be so, and wishes to become something; but in that, there is resistance to be something too. Or, nothing is so hard to be, that as it tries to, things get pushed aside, or out we'd say, as their implosion is resisted. 
            <br>&emsp;Quicjly, there are too primary points born from this, one being the explanation for physics, and the other being an identity of entirety. Simply, I believe, that by the simple intracies of basic motion, that over much iterative interaction, that the complex things that we see can be made; and by that, all that is required is a base motion: which, like the ocean, can act indiscremiantly of other points, but within a domain, or body of other points, who, in what we could suppose as slight differences in magnitude (or a supposed direction), that such a basic nudge thats not paralell to another, creates a difference and thus proceeding compounding -of which our current actions came to be. Secondly, is in the limits of this motions, or at least domain in which they rest in. For, the nature of nothing may be everywhere; and by virtue of the universe being but invisible past the farthest light its produced, so could there be an eternity of which this natural nothing resides. There are some descriptive fallacies that occur, but another alternate view, of a limited sort, is that, of this root place in which the basic nudges are made, so could that, being all in entirety, be inside the bounds of what is elsewhere barren. And by that, there may be an inherint limitedness, or shortness to entirety, and that our view of its limit and place is but an illusion, or vulgarity in description, of what is in fact only partially, if not soon to be not so. "At least, there may be nothing except that which is struggling to be so; and the ends of that, as we'd commonly say, may never be reached, as perhaps such a struggle will never end. But so is the realm, or void in which nothing is otherwise kept from being not, truly so: meaning we are but partial things -of a struggling sort- amidst a barren void. Which, to be clear, contrasts the otherwise view that nothing (and its possible, if not universal) struggle is eternal and through." What I reflect most kindly on though, is that my place in recgonition, is not much different than the parts of a plant which work its way towards the suns draw: and that by that, so are my own faculites and maturity pleased with nothing: whether that be eternal, or barren. "Who, would even care if they were eternally nothing, or outside of possible abscence? In my mind, the place and according ends (as'd be conceived) fairs not much more than a monkey: the difference being, that of that primate, rational am I, aware that I am."

            Two things come to mind, one being the annals of man, and the oddness of supposition.
            <br>&emsp;For one, we must address the fact that 10,000 years is quite a long time. And in regards to man, his truest ancestor is nearly 300 of those intervals away. As of late, we have employed our industry and craft, but so are we of the same make as those who begun such venture. As we go through the periods prior, so we see that our nature, or configuration rather changes, till at least that moment where Erectus split from the more earthly primates. But so in the periods which followed then, was there much which changed; and in that, I feel that theres few reasons to suppose that our behavior, speech and according thinking didnt come about. "It might have indeed taken us 10,000 years to say the, and another to say dog, but so upon the year following would our otherwise oohs and awws -which monkeys make upon there own expressions- be made in such consonant ways: but so we could point to the dog." And I believe that much has happened in such means of idenitification, and that the ability to address things came long before the figures which we'd say hold our current roots came to be. And what I wonder then, is by whichever course of development, did we reach a point where our experiences led us to believe that our minds and the worlds workings was both governed, and seperate between that which goverened and the objects subject to it. I simply dont know.
            <br>&emsp;But what I believe has happened, is that as children have impressionble minds, so too were the ages of man comparably susceptible -be it of his own workings, or the mere grandeur of nature, and its according reveal as our senese grew in acuity. The conseqeuence of this though, is that those, more or less, poor impressions, acted as points of evdience, and accordingly shaped our view of the world. Now, in even the most ancient of times, are we more sophisticated in our superstition, elaborate we'll say. Yet, my feeling, is that those beliefs are the result of confirmation of the supposition that is rooted in those old beliefs. "By that I mean, that augurs, mystics, preaches and saints, held part of their appeal and recognition on the dissemination and or proofs of things people already believed." In that, we'd say, that of the truth they are but confirming, rather than exploring based on unprejudiced evdience.
            <br>&emsp;I'd say we are brought to our known conundrum, that of those who appeal to the appearnece of reality in the soundest way, and build their view of the world by the suppositions that reflect that accurate aim, that the stains of miracles and intervention burrow their way in as things of an evident sort. And, as we say, rocks have their according course of explanation, while someone turning water into wine has its own. Only, I believe, that by virtue of the common notion of a witness' general unreliablity, and the otherwise confusion for things that are as unidentified as comparably common things -ie., our basic mind and the act of a medium- that such awkward occurences are but mistaken truths of something which is not miraculous in the way described, or beyond natural at that. This, admittedly, as a sketcial take on the merrits of being judicial, and the doubts that such the accounts for such miracles and interventions are given with such fidelity. And I dont mean to be cynical, or scornfull that is, but by the point I already made, that both ones care and notion that such supernatural things ought be verified, as such things make the nature of things weird, so does a prior supposition that nature is of such supernaturla ways, or at least possible and or chartered as being so -on account of other supposed miracles- that such current divine acts are not awkward in any sort. "For in truth, they are not enlightening into the nature of things, by confirmations of the view already knonw." Amd the regression of that is one of increasing fraility.
            <br>&emsp;Its simply hard to be around people who find congruence and contrariety on the basis of old ways, and accordingly the vulagr roots of that. "In a word, people are either dreaming, walking with their head down, strutting with their head held overly confident or high: and nearly none have any reproach, as to not be so sure, or critical, but doutbfull, curious, inquisitive, skeptical. By the virtues of rationality, of which we as creatures are of the sort, being so explorative and in an integral way, marks us being truly so: for, we are more less the rational animal, and as a saw is virtuous by its functioanl demand of being sharp, that so to are we in our ratioanilaity, virtuous by the functional demands of that; and so much as we are, maturity is our claim; and as one who is brittle and of vice is no whole or true way of a thing, so are we, with all our sensibility and felicity, complete, found, warm.... a man."

            Lets detail this out. There are the misfortunes of the world and within life; meaning death rates amongst children, or those infected with measels, or the impoverished and or victims of civil cause. Then there is danger, be it civil (as in homicide) or from combat -as a result of governments deploying their offenses or defensese. Lastly, and worse understood, is the predictions of our time ahead; which, in most ways, comes from our modern scenario. Namely, these amount to the indefinite and mystical view of AI and machines, the ultimate yet impractically (at least by the given clarity so far) use of nuclear missiles, the appropraitely concerning view of climate change, but its poorly described result, and the otherwise risk of a meteor impact. 
            <br>&emsp;Personally, this latter section is riddled with suppostions that remedy the certainty of pundants and fools: but so, like in most cases, dont I know. That is the future though, and for the most part these issues can be better stated upon the world as a whole. And by that, beyond the conflicts between governments and those iniated for such cause, there is not much more than the common rungs of life, and all its expected and or inefficient problems.
            <br>&emsp;My place as a man then seems unclear. For I am in many ways responding to the thin and rampant views from others, who come from points of ignorance and no sense; and such impressions by me lead me to deal with the irritation. As, per whats common, I simply remove their argument; as under the suitable suppostion, there view comes mightily short. This is a restless approach though, for in our particular modern scenario, so are there many expressions of that sort being brought forth. "And it is not always our place not to listen." Instead, I find, and accordingly seek, the actual knowledge which our suppositions are based on. Notably, the concenr of violence is so ill put, that our selection of knowledge in fact bears our suppositions against those who ignornatly plead; only, the solidity of such knowledge is neither deep nor encompassing; and so by that, despite our fit confidence, so are we without solid ground. Secondly, remarks nuclear warfare, and our admittedly fair yet quaint understanding of its nature and effect; which, accordingly, leaves us with less supposition, and thus less to go against those who ardently propose. This is fine in many ways, and for the most part the issues of AI and climate find themselves similarly. But so is this result one of non-invovlemnt, as opposed to the more present yet rugged engagement regarding our common lives. 
            <br>&emsp;As a skeptic, my belief is not that things cannot be found, only, of the approach I believe there is more that needs accounting, and thus our paces should amend with an according doubt (or reservation). Similarly, my brief understadning and overall sensibility and reproach lead me to have more refined and non-inflammatory views regarding the world's future: but so is this but a bread crumb of our core nature and its consequently base supposition, which, practically, simply draws me to then clarify that position and bring it to life.

            As we like to say, mechanics reflect the interactions of things, while theism, or what remarks the divine, pays respect to the basis for such movements -in that they were introduced or contrived.
            <br>&emsp;This is what science does though, in that it pays attention to particular things, or at least the function and means by which the waves of reality move. Only, if there is a soul, and the basis for mechanics (beyond its relations amongst particulars) is arbitrary, then so can ontology be our only sight as to how the soul of things operates, or came to be. Common sense regarding this may suppose, that how the soul originates and is proposed, can bear the unviseral nature by which it imparts the roots of mechanics to have the variation as to propell un-uniformity, and by that interactions that cause change. 
            <br>&emsp;The dialectic though is almighty hard to describe, for in that, there are but mere illustrations or figures regarding it and our approach to speaking about it; yet, as a subject, it amounts to all, and thus it is the terms which we'd remark upon it that act as the core defintion -for our understanding- as opposed to representing it before we know and see what 'it' is.
            <br>&emsp;The second I begin to think, the concept, or idea of something comes to mind; yet, of the whole, there is no pure concept, as, of my thought and the subject it contains, so is all part of the whole. Science has this peculiarity then, as it can extract something particular, analyze it and address it; nor is it limited to an instance, but an entire class of things, in terms of kinds; or of the class of all members of entirety; only, once even the basis for things is known and in this sense considered, there is no room for concepts, as there is not something distinct, or seperate, regarding that which equates to all.
            <br>&emsp;This may indeed bridge the gap of that all to erroneous mark of placing entirety within the bounds  of what we mistakenly suppose as another entirety. And, for me, the core trouble of philosophy and physics, is that, of existence, we mean all that moves, interacts, is; yet, of the basis, be it willed in or a remark of a universal fabric which we are wrong to suppose anything beyond, so are we ultiamtely seperating the two; whereby, the error of describing the location of entirety is more like the description of existence within a realm which gave birth to it, but is seperate: and that is not what entirety is. In a skeptical sense, the objects we see are supposedly born of a base which introduced the beginnings of their being: but this divine layer so to speak, is seperate, eternal, beyond the objects which it birthed: the soul. The issue, is that the extent of objects does not go far enough to propose itself, and by that, we suppose an arbitrayer layer, which, less our own objective intuitions, is ultiamtely vast and boundless -as this remarks the nature of what we suppose. 
            <br>&emsp;In truth however, it seems that what has governed and bore the things which we use science and thinking to describe, is not in fact attached to something more primary than it, or at least soul like. Instead, it is more like the soil of the ground, and the seeds of a plant which root themselves in and trunk themselves up: to now, whereby their branches have broadened, the vines have mingled, and the fruits have dropped and the land which all around Man sees. 
            <br>&emsp;The issue, is that without having an arbitrary layer, and less we have a stricter understanding of how things objectively are and came to be, then we are left with a mystery of how all things are part of the same, yet within a bound; or at least, not merely a domain which rests outside the mind and will of some soulish layer. What we are saying, is that the basis for those things, and what their supposed place is merrited on, is in fact part of the string. 
            <br>&emsp;Science it would seem, starts from front to back, and whether it chips away at the top edge, or works its way back, so is it looking into the dark sea beneath it. Skeptically, we know not what is down there for we cannot at this point see it: yet we do believe that there is an ocean floor. 
            <br>&emsp;And I would say, in short, that the two elements of discourse and enquiry is in our actuall thinking, as to remark an absolute truth as is becoming of the whole -as opposed to seperating existence from some seperate entity that contrived it. And secondly, that in our descriptions, we ought to advance enough to be equiped for the appropraite details in coloring the absolute. "For, the primitive and in some cases vulage shortcomings of us in our attempt, leads us to see things as seperate." Which in terms of the heart of our regard, really falls short as we bank too much on what we see to be real, but then close on the fact that of such things and how they appear, that only a contrivance could concieve and produce this: and this, at its core, is disjointed thinking, for why, in your subjection of the things which you deem fit for conception (or willed- birth), do you define them as so, but without the whole origins as part of that? It is that classic example of identity, whereby you say, a star could never come to be, for it is something and of things they can not come from nothing...less they were given. And one then says, 'the sun you say', 'what exactly do you mean? For I see atributes and qualities sure; but such impression is a remark of science rather than thought? And are you really saying that the divine is neccessary on the basis of what science deems? For, the actual true concept and idea of the sun, pushed all the way till it is in fact truly proposed, is one where the birth of it is included, or at least, as a mark of the subject, supposed. It seems wrong to suppose something beyond the subject, on the basis of forgoing what we would in fact already have to suppose to identify the subject in and of itself. We have not done that, which bears some reproach from your divine suppostion; nor, in our actually scientific or inquisitive remark, have we defined what the object (of the sun) is?' The biggest quandery of thinking then comes to fruition, in whether or not all things are the same? And if they are, then how can we properly suppose what they are as strands of the same cloth, if the actual nature and or beginnigs of the cloth are unknown? For we seem then, to have flaps and folds, which are the only remark of such whole: yet, as particulars, they are not themselves truly knonw, withouth their basis within such whole. "And all, more our ease of sake, comes to conclusion that things must be seperate." But that is just the dialectic. And Man is surely past the confines of that. "For he mistakes the grasp of his mind, in its attempt to see the whole, as the destination, or manifestation which it is made for. Only, I would say, that as the whole remarks what is known, and our struggle in doing so seems to come by our limitations otherwise, that we simply remark the nature of that fact, in that of true knowledge we are unprivy: and in accords we should be, as if that limitation gave and corresponded us to respect such insight." And my belief, is that in such absolute reproach, that my otherwise common senses and basis for description, works itself in definig and illustrating the limit that I see. "And personally, things just make sense."

        <div id="appearenceofsense">
            I find little to hold onto from evidence which is, however grim and unfortunate, indirect in its source, and otherwise isolated amongst other adjacent facts, and the world as a whole.
            <br>&emsp;When I look at the statsitics for mortality though, I see the world quite large, or broadened rather: as if the width of entirety has increased. "More facts to consdier, or strands if you will."
            <br>&emsp;Only, in that, I see something seperate from wholistic thinking; as per that, the sole course of that is united, be it of one or many strands. And, as we suspend our view of how many strands there are, and further the amount, so must we come to terms with those facts, whereby we can attest to the whole with those as part of them. 
            <br>&emsp;This is why inquiry is so hard, for we would more likely prefer a total understanding, or view at least to have a correspindingly solid regard. Science then is quite limting, if only our submission to the whole is witheld, or reproached from, for the sake of furthering our view of the whole itself. 
            <br>&emsp;Ultimately, we may find ourself sinking into it as a whole, but so is the reason for learning and growing present. That issue then is the crux of all things, for why, if we truly were bare in our complexity of things, would we not further that as to gain the rewards of being settled into something more complex?
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps it is the nature of our mind, that it wishes to, or at least eventually does, settle into an absolute state: as if, be it an ocean or pond, it drifts and sinks into the sea. "Merrily and truly, down the stream of entirety." 
            <br>&emsp;There is defiently room for critique, in that, as we offer ourself to an expanded view, that we get carried away. Yet, of that scrutiny, ought we be clear on whether were scolding over the reproach from the entirety we currently see, or whether, in that expansion, we get lost, or at least taken, by vicious actions.
            <br>&emsp;I would say, in all, that we are definitely nothing of any phenomena. Our senses, are but intricate reactions to the equally intricate stitchings of matter, of which our own stitchings response. In a word, that we are warm, or at least, if our blood flow is low and accordingly, our tissue is slow and stiff, that the nerves of our body reaact in a way as to begrieve us with the effect of that stiffness. This is a very tricky explanation. For, a rock, if melted, merely goes through the chemcial process' inherent to heat. And our point, is that our hand, for instance, if burnt, merely goes through that, in that it is configured in such a kinetic way. The question, or oddity, is, if we have a nerve attached to that point being re-configured, and by virtue of the nerves purpose in making us move away, that the response it gives is one that causes the recpeient (be it in parts or whole) of that signal (or concern) to move. "Reflexes seem to be a less autonomous, or at least explciit case of non-autonmous kind of this." The oddity, is in the descruption, or identiy for that matter, of the signal given, and how, with the admission that there is a complex which recieves such signal, that within such entaglement (of other nerves and tissue will say, ie. our brain) the experience of pain is dealt. Neuorlogially, it amy be so, that our hand is actually hurt, and our brain becomes privy to that; or, the brain makes us feel pain, because, as conseuqnt of the injury to our hand, it responds by yeilding us pain as to cause the neccessary (and developed) response -as injury, by virtue of surviing tigers and that of basic threats (ie., and injury, or toxic smell).
            <br>&emsp;I think, pehraps, regarding this senseation, that to bring it closer to a point of the experience, which is to say that their is a stimuli and impresson of it, that the object of pain need be understand, as is the case for our construction of an image, and the sense we have of seeing.
            <br>&emsp;For the issue comes to 'I', in that, as an image, be it constant or quick frames, that I am seeing it. And I beleive, that there is not an 'I' who is seeing the image, but rather, the image, as per the qualitires of it being visual and defintie (as in the attributes of color, distance), that this is all there is. It is the recognition of this which we mistake as 'I'; yet, I believe, that of that 'I', it is equally born of the same source of reception: and akin to an anxious thought, that with the view as it is, that our means for thought gets confused (upon asking) of that view: and we, accordingly, deem them seperate.
            <br>&emsp;For we surely believe, or refer at least, to the pain of a flame as a different expereince as that of a smell. Considering these are all molecular, and that pain is merely a treatment by that, as is the recptors of your nose taking in the molecules, that, per your speech and inner speech, that these are but wandering cases of the faculties of those, bearing upon those other faculties. "Meaning, that your smell, by its sense, doesnt pay attention to pain, as if it were an expereince of pain dealt to smell; and, as I suppose, it is the mere descritive nature of your mind, and its function of enveloping things as to bring meaning of things and the envelopment given, that the mystery of the other senses affords us no clear means to envelop; and so we suppose, or at least beleive that the distinction of those and the mind seeking clarity, is an indicator itself as to what each is: in that, of those things trying to be conceived, that their impression onto something seemingly sperate, being the mind, that such mind is in fact special: perhaps, by virtue of it being the unqique facultiy which is trying to discern. Smell merely percieves smell, and sight vision: but I believe that we confuse the mind as something other than its own mere (but equally born) faculty, doing what it does: and that as rotten gas is the object which your sense of smell recieves, so is that sense, and all others things sensed, imparted onto the mind as a receipt." And I deem this, though more interesting in the way that a rock is less so than a tree, to be of the same kind as a rock is to the tree. And thus it, like all others, rests within entirety, and is thus, a receptor of senses and words: but these are mere concepts or pleas to move. But as your smell doesn't bring you outside entiretys common realm (or paces), so is your mind, althoguhr privy to all, privialged in no different way. 
            <br>&emsp;In that, I deem the ways of our mind to be a concern for science. As, the object which conceives of pain and vision, is of an equally real sort; and just as I cannot say how the fluid dynamics of my vein work, so am I unclear how the impact of external objects manifests in a pain or visual response. But, as the effect of those objects is merely a configuration of them and oursleves, so are we, as a body, privy to such impact of its parts; and by virtue of a reflex, which comes through the body, so is the treatment of an injurous kind one, that by virtue of the nerves which surround the tissue, and the way that electcity runs, as if at each point through a wire, so is, the brain which sits on the other end configured in its own way, as to configure itself as a consequent of the reception.
            <br>&emsp;All we are trying to say, is that, the expereince of pain is not something, of the body even, which is felt by something other than the body (or some part of it at least). Rather, the re-configuraton which causes a change, and what we call sensation, is merely an impetus to the re-configuration of other part of us, which we call mind or experience. For instance, if our stomach is sore, our toes don't feel it; at least their not impacted to much. And it seems that the roots of behavior and basic movment (towards food or away from explicit danger) is in need of understanding, as to better flesh out the arrangments that our configuration is dealt with.

        <div id="tailoredpast">
            There are small scenarios of conflict in the world. In those, there is trauma, some gratuity and putridity, discomfort, perill, anxiety and the looming sense of threat; nor, in Mans entire has, has he been absent of these properties. In fact, the past has held particularlry more scenarios then there is now a days.
            <br>&emsp;Our present age has more stability than that. And in this, it seems schocking to see anything more. The common threats of the world come at us otherwise, like the suns inevitable heat. Children die from malnourishment, their mothers somtimes in birthing them. Infections are common all around, as are struggles between folks, or at least accidents caused by them.
            <br>&emsp;Whats important to rememeber is that conflict comes when those common troubles are not dealt with, and that by virtue of others who have, or at least the assessment that their strenght will be your weakness, theres a response. This may be cultural, as over time the familiarity of people reflects negatively upon eachother -as if someone else is the cause of their own trouble. Nor is relgion but a sharp contributor towards this. At any rate, whether you solve your problems locally, or bear upon those who have, so is preseration key. Moreover, some of us only participate while others serve on our behald; a fireman is no different, in that he helps me in my own burning home.
            <br>&emsp;In my case, as has our stability granted this to most, that were civilians, toiling to maintain ourselves, or at least thriving as our needs are efficeintly met. I hate acting as though our situation is the norm; nor do I like to minimize the pain and vice present in less privlaged conflicts.
            <br>&emsp;But I am still a man, who's health is never quite within my soverignenty, but rather I to it. Compared to those starving, or exotically ill, I am privilaged; but so is my character challenged as others around me poorly spend their excess; nor, are the common pains of the flu or fatigue absent from our ways. And by that, as I'd say the norms for money and comfort compare, am I still subject to tasks and amends. Someone fighting for their immediate life is not comparable: I merely suggest that we lie in the same domain.
            <br>&emsp;And indeed I am privilaged, for my concerns are both less in terms of mitigating pain and suffering; nor, are we even personally absent from concerns to do with excess. "As if oppertunity or past times were our privilaged regard." Ought I do these well though? For in that, my attention is onto making good use of my privalage, and of a genuine sort -as my free time is not well spent, or rightly used in a privalged sense, for frivolity or indulgence.
            <br>&emsp;I guess my feeling is that, of the severe threats to humanity, it is up to governments and their assemblies to convene; and at least arrange their relations and ways as to remove the ability for enough nukes to be dropped -as would cause nuclear winter. 
            <br>&emsp;My spirit is a remark upon me, and in my solid state, I give, or shine at least upon which others stare. This is the philanthropy and gift by which one's very prescence can facilitate change, or an impact at least. But this heart is carried on two legs; and so does it beat naturally, without ask for anything. But if those legs are stiff, then it has no room, or vitality, in its offer. Thats why they say to the wealthy, 'give some away, for you have the most'. I may earn the favor of others in donating little; nor is this even remarked as unsubstantial. But there is an understanding that it is nearly a sentiment. 
            <br>&emsp;I guess I would say, that if I knew that 20$ would make a huge change, then I would offer. But for now, I am ignorant of that, so I dont. This is an assessment though, in the sense that of my current strides, I see no view whereby we could change the world. And in that, I am ignorant to how well I could be and am, and the impact that could make. This all feels contradcitory, as perhaps I am inherintly being selfish. For I dont believe that my course should be for the sake of others; as although they are lower than me, so do I only have so much to give; as, from their heart and sentiment is little of what they own asked of; and by that, despite having more, so do I only have so much; at least, by virtue of having duties of our own -be it natural or of excess. 
        </div>
        <div id="drygrievance">
            Perhaps some honesty can keep us from tangenting off to a weary demise. Simply, the comments by others regarding peoples problems makes me upset. Or, I am tasked with confirming otherwise. I dont remove the fact of other's suffering and misfortune, or the calousness and duty in those responsible. But I do reproach from over refining our views, as to make things all hunbled and bunched up. This is the problem you see. For the world is large, and a summary view of it, particularly when that one is negative, is quite ppor. Only, the reason that I see it as so, is because such a reality is one that draws so much empathy and greivance from me. For others can be seemingly treated with pure rancor and putridity, or gratuity no less. And the sentiment that this is pervasive and constant is so petrifying, that I am left  to ignore that and feel the shame of turning my head; or, I produce an alternative, or measure of suggestion and repraoch no less as to mitigate the views all too certain and baseless source. 
            <br>&emsp;In pratice,  it is not the case that there is no trouble, or reason for concern. But when the impression given to me is all to shallow and condensed, I cannot help but either retort, or humbly pass the opionion by. The truth, is that dealing with everyone's problems is a harsh despair. Nor, is the removal of characture and its pervailing gratuity a pleasing act; for you may not know exactly where it starts and ends; nor is the actual fact of the act, in that someone was injured or killed removed. 
            <br>&emsp;Our struggle then, is not that we read or hear of someones experience and deem it false. We see that it is true, fully even; but what it means, and at least the reaction of others in how they judge it as so, barrs me from having a sympathetic response. For, if it were true, that someones troubles or distress was so meaningfull, then so would my condolences reflect. But, the nature of this being an incidence, and the removal of sensation or shallow facts, makes it something which is far away, out of concern, or at least something whose impact is but relevant to the subject at hand. There are so many people in the world, and not one remarks an indication of how they all act. Nor would several; for in virtue of that, so is the case for all deemed relevant.
            <br>&emsp;Our greiving comes from ignoring something deemed important. "As if there were a war, and we sat here, igrnoing that; acting at least as if it werent relevcant to us, by which our concenr was more locally addressed." I wish not to do this. But I also dont wish to see everyone through their death, or peril at that. In some sense, I remove the poor taste of depiction, as the death by weapon is then comparable to the death by labour, or tuberculoous, in that each  were a death: and as I care not for someone who dies of a heart attack in South Sudan, so don't I have conerns for someone killed in the Russia. Not all acts are the same; and, although it is harshly unclear, so is there room for what you'd fairly deem gratuitious. But so in that sense are we called to care, not because the death is more substantial, but because it is signifcant. For theres no one at fault for the mortalities caused by respiratory failure. But of those who kill, frighten and derrange, so are they villains, perps, purely at fault. The nature of the conflict and accuracy of its operations come to head; but so are we still keen, or more prone at least to grieve and sympathize with those subject to such inhumane activity. 
            <br>&emsp;I relate this to our duty, or care even, for voting representaives, in that as citizens it is our only right to do. We may from groups as to offer a voice, but so is our direct impact through suffrage. Yet, the place for a sole person seems small; and equally, the seemingly less direct positiion to mitigate or aid one who is within normal peril. I wonder though, of those perrils which are more aggresive and conceieved, why are we any more positioned to impact that? Our voice perhaps is offered, in that we can give our concerns to those who could make a difference. By that token though, I see little who in fact offer anything of that sort for matters of any other kind, locally even. 
            <br>&emsp;So I am left with the prompt to speak up, or otherwise to suppose that not much is going wrong; or at least rest on the foreign and unfortunate yet fair nature of the conflict and its consequences. I'm not fretting over warlords in Africa, or Cartels in americas, nor the terroists and groups in the mid east: why should I care about those whose conflict is severe with any differnce in Russia? And again, I am not saying that there isnt retched affairs that occur. But so ought we characterize and depict it well; in particular, as a blend of every small thing, and amidst the body of memebers around and their own paces. Nothing is ever reported or given this way; and in some sense it is why we fret even less over the many deaths from giving birth; as we can see the more commo ncourse in which that point was reached, a path which we deem credible. But when we see prisoners or hear accounts, or intuit even gross conceptions or near certain realities, so are the paces upon that given ill-regard.
            <br>&emsp;My country is not under attack. Nor are there many which are doing so with any threat to me. I am not being conscripted, nor am I in a unique position, as amongst each countries military there is a body of citizens, one of which is me. I cannot say with explicity that I fair in doing so; nor am I saying that only particular circumstances deem me as so -in denying to fight that is. 
            <br>&emsp;I just care little about my voice; nor am I looking at the array of spots, and seeing any massive piece of it (or many) that are off. Life, and our countries, are like coral reefs; whereby amongst the many, there are kinds, who act differently and thrive in their own kindred or specific ways. And so is the realm full of its differences, be it in the edges, depths, fauna, and neighbours too. I dont feel bad, beyond my sympathay for any specific fish -be it of instances or patterns among those with shared characteristics- in not commentating or chimming in; for, as I believe, it is the faculties and branches of the world which, amidst our association, bear effect to those subjects. And in that, I find little which I even know about such branches; and nothing outside of brevity and adolescnece which sees me confidence in moving anything beyond an inch. 
            <br>&emsp;Our own efforts seem fair then. Perhaps, like some, we do wish to serve, or discipline ourselves to the roles which help. But I am tired of feeling bad for not; at least in the way that is shoved down our throats. And my resolve otherwise, is to strenghten what we suppose, so that I dont feel so unfarily bad, but also not so beholden to argue and succeede: as a man, along whichever course, fortuned or not, I can be, at peace, relaxing, creative, active, at rest, with ease, for fun while playing, industrious in doing, to all oppertunities and success, and our core stability and inherint task. "In which, our common and local command, is to configure ourselve twoards that: and perhaps then, shine."

            There seems to be no argument which couldn't sign our deed as to be ingratiated with the current and awe of everything.
            <br>&emsp;In that, we are free, as our spirit is in line with the stream; and by that, we tend to row merrily, to which around we spread our shine, or otherwise offer a sincerest and whole ready hand.
            <br>&emsp;Only, we are men, and still becoming one at that. Hereby, our desires, as a remark of distracction or true distress, cause our course towards that purity to be sidetracked. In that, we are never so clear as to proceed whole heartedly, and thereby give. Instead, we are left putting out fires, or tedning to our wounds -be it of implse or fair concern.
            <br>&emsp;Where I struggle is in our remedy to this, in that, of that which we lack, so do we turn inwards; which, in itself, seems to bring us to a comparable state as that one where our heart is generous, only, the paces of that way are not but nearby, or local that is. In that, I give due regard to troubles and toil that are in fact around me: but of the world, or those who are but foreigners abroad, so do my paces never reach their way. 
            <br>&emsp;It is true that if our strides were more common, then so would they bring us with constance and lenght, and thereby reach more than what sat outside our door. 
            <br>&emsp;We've reached the dialectic though, for our concern here is not a true skepticisim of our path, but rather an reflection on how our current state is comapred to one's prior which were seemingly then of solidity. That is the contradiction, that were brining this up in the first place. And, rightly so, for I believe that our fear od comfort and posterity is the owner of our attention; or, similarly, that of our purity, we are more bent on it bringing us to the hopes of the former. Only when we remove such need, and see hope in bringing ourselves out in a ways that promise happiness, so can I relax, sincerely but commonly be (as opposed to staking it on ambition). Only, in this case, we are left with the barenss of direction, and otherwise grime of others pain; moreover, our coommon pace, although of a good kind, holds its view close and from within; and in that, the strides which would otherwise bear us upon those foolish and suffering is beyond our scenery.
            <br>&emsp;That is the dialcetic you see, for you are fine, right? In that you are truly worthwhile and ordained as you were in those moments which have your current difference remarking upon. Only, in reflecting on so, it seems like were back to square one, despite, in all likelihood, having the place and means to reach such preferred state more readily and often. 
            <br>&emsp;Our reflection though is upon that station, in that you would be brimming and in tune, and by that, present to all and without fear or scrutiny. So does that pitcht slow though; and in that, our desire comes to question, for in many ways or mishap of that causes us to act in ways that run contrary to keeping the pitch high -as our efforts loose their lightness, as is common with things in a state of maintence, but rather, due to our lack, we bear down on our efforts as to feel more engaged, but therein run over.

            Deswcribing things is hard to do. For one, there is this nominal notion, that, of the parts which things are made up of, that each holds exlusivity in the definition; whereas of the configurations, or bodies which they make, that those hold the terms.
            <br>&emsp;This is a remark of terms though and is not really that important for our purposes.
            <br>&emsp;What we see is that there is a whole, and within that there sits the bodies we commonly recognize, their parts of which each is given regard, or a mere ostnesible assortment of bodies which act as mere subjects, and are otherwise as such subject to the finer entities which make them. This is our identity of existence.
            <br>&emsp;The question, is where does such existence lye? For, as I believe it is common, one may wonder, 'how did man come to be, or rocks, trees?' The notion of a seed may shine light onto the truth, in that a tree isnt simply a case of there being one following there not. But so in that source, the root we'll call it, lies the mystery of introduction, 'for how did the sprouting begin?'
            <br>&emsp;This is where God is assmebled, as we deem the creation of something from nothing as implausible, and thus such origins must be intoroduced, or contrived that is.
            <br>&emsp;And for the most part I think this is fine to suppose, for of a thing, which came from nothing, so would the deliverance of that beginning seem neccessary of a will.
            <br>&emsp;Only, the descriptions of the things introduced is where the quandery comes in, for they, as things who are supposedly introduced arbitrarily, must be shown to be things, as opposed to mere rips in a voided fabric. Better yet, if we think, innately, that there is God, and for instance that because we can address him as such, or think of him in that way, and in accordnace justify his existence by the virtue of our recognition -an Aquinian ontological principle- so would I say, that of God, and our regard for him and the according identity of what were regarding, holds such definition under the scrutiny of description. Which, in other words, means that of God and our conception of him, that the properties which we grant him is paramount in actually identifying him. For all things do indeed have properties; which itself may be a quanderous statement, by virtue of the mystery of universals and predicates; though, I believe that, despite the deep point, that our problem still lies.
            <br>&emsp;As I see it, the issue with neccistating the ecxistence of God on the basis of our ability to concieve him, is one that seeks only to then confirm what we already know. "That is, in some sense, the aim of scholasticsim; not to discover what is true and derive conclusiosn from that; but rather to argue for what we already know, as if to give reasons why our innate beleives are laudible." And the notion that God has certain properties seems equally riddled with equal presumptions; that just as we believe in him innately, so is there a given description of this innate belief that he is all powerfull, seeing and present. Which, on the line of believing in hiim innately, seems fair to associate those qualities with him. "For they in fact represent the properties of the thing we believe in -and in other words describe the subject of our belief."
            <br>&emsp;Where this all comes to head is in the existence which Gods neccessity is supposed upon. "For, in some way more or less, he is given status by the neccessity of his being: for, of existence, so must he have given." 
            <br>&emsp;Sleptically, there is the limitation of what existence even is. For one, there is the descriptive fallacy of baser pieces being perceived as wholes, and beyond the nominal issue of identity, there is simply confusion about the derivation occurs. I think the issue is mute, but even if parts and wholes had their own names, there is no clear insight as to the core of those parts, and thus, percieved or not, the basis for the wholes. "I will grant you a firetruck, and the lego that made it as parts; and there may be a red brick, and a red side of the truck: but what are the legos made of? Atoms surely, but what are those? For, then even, we mistake protons for Quarks, which are really grouped up, orineted indivudally amongst others doing the same, and that is what a proton is. And this may indeed merrit the  distinction of nominality, or it may be irrelvant and the identity in place may be better understood as the real entitties at hand. But so is the depths of that unknown. And, accordingly, as I see it, the neccessity of something on the basis of the neccsisty which it is proposed to offer, seems weak when the reason in which it is necessary (being the things which it grants) is unknown (or limitedly defined)."

        <div id="dimdisgrace">
            There is no reason to be afraid. The world is fine, in that of those subject to experience, they do so through their own paces. Not war, nor violence, thievery and rape, can pillary our truest soul. "For there is not but the warmest glow and cheer within our humanity, that it is but a misfortune that our objectives can cause such bad: there is nothing wrong though: and by that, no need for right."
            <br>&emsp;As we please, life is ours, and can be so without disgrace. For, the routes and moves of things is out of our control; nor, is our impact, resting on the neccessary perril that will occur otherwise. There are merely paces, and no matter the arrangment, so is nature bound through that. And she toils us, asks us to amend, as to recieve what is good. Who we are though, is young, afraid, and by our oldest sentiment, a war has gone on. But so has this not changed the heart of man; for only commericals and immature professionals speak as if it is otherwise; when in fact, the letters of soldiers, combat surgeons, priests, leaders, people, speaks of a life, that amidst all that holds any pernicous bad, is still one that covers little of our life: at least, seldom amounts we can account for, and of those who in partciular can, so are they amidst their own entirety and its shortness of account. I fear nothing then, for it is not my place to remove strands of bad; that is for the culture and proclivity of man to decide. So is this entire though, massive, broad. Reasonably, we need more to say, for it is surely not the case that common mortalityies or the trauma experienced by folks in war is somehting indifferent. But so is the course of this a natural one, with paces that litter themselves around all but the harshest elements of conflict. I see this as a bold permission to remain ourselves: for, the reality which we are dealth to from being so, and in effect not so outwardly ordained, is not one of gratuitous abandomnet, but the stream of living. And of that, the moments of conflict which hold the only poor suffering, is one that our ignornace cannot treat. But in our understanding, so do we see it as a crumb amidst an ocean of otherwise green and civility. In that there is toil, but not of such rancid ways, or unfair ones at that. 
            <br>&emsp;Because of this, I am ot afraid, for my empathys can rest in what nature means us to be willing; and of that, it is not a slew of horrid wounds or punctures, but rather the passing of days and beat of the sun. Stress and trauma do occur, but they are like the fowls and injuries while playing a sport; expected, but not the definition of the sport. Even in war, if a battle calls men to engage in killing, so are they done so for objectivity sakes; and of those who recieve or giveth, I retain by the merrits of letters and abscence of all things contrary to what is notable of writing, that these are men who engage, and as such come forth, expereince, suffer and remain.
            <br>&emsp;By that, we only have our right freedom, as opposed to privilage. And I do mean to see and further know the true side of perril; and otherwise round out our whole and primary view. But so upon this, are we are own man, and subject to desire and joy: the regards of which mark the assimilation of fear, which holds somehitng less so, in apprehension at you being forthright and extensive in your freedom. "As compared to merely accepting the neutral form of life: but really do that, be it for impact, integrity, or rightous claim: so ought you be fine with only that, and cower not at the thought of your own contentment with it: whereby, the fortune taht bears you pleasure, be it in comfort or steadyiness, so can that be requested, accepted, expected, and arranged: at least, of our suitability in being so, is where we must attend -as to say, ask, teach, offer, seek truth, affirm reason, state contrarety, or what your taking serious."

        <div id="fullscomplexion">
            Science rests as the descriptive measure of existence. Existence, is a distinguishing factor from what we suppose is eternal. As it were, there is an ocean of limitless depth; and by it, willfully, or of something more ordinary, the inital movement of matter was made. The relationship between those movements is referred to as mechanics; and of all things mechanical, ie. fusion, orbits, gravity, kinetics and sound, science is the means to describe such things. 
            <br>&emsp;As for the whole of it, theism, as comapred to deism, is one of eternal and all encompassing reality; but in that, there is a distinct difference of deism, as it -really as a modern, or alternate kind of theism- defines such eternity as indifferent, while theism holds notions of design. More importantly though, is that even if existence was designed, with a model in the mind of the one, or eternal being who iniated, so is there the issue of constancy; which says that, for one, the currents of existence are not done like a play, whereby the results in place can willy nilly change. This contrasts which aspects of theism, which commonly permitt intervention, or disturbance. "Make this go my way, give my muscles and bones strenght, fix our illness, etc." 
            <br>&emsp;The interesting fact then comes when we consider whether something is scientific or theism -with deism being a alternate view, particularly when it comes to the constancy of things. The mind for instance, is commonly referred to as something beyond existence, as either its own entity, or accompanyment to that which is also circumspect to existence (the eternal). 
            <br>&emsp;We must ask questions though, for in trying to prove everything by saying how anything else is wrong is troublesome. For, if science details all, then what gave birth to that? Is it a natural ontology, or something contrived? And so, if we try and explain whether the mind is of existence, or beyond, it fairs us an arduous task to do so, by negating, or inquiring, into the actual scientific basis, or extent rather, of the mind, when the point in which it would reach as to be either natural or not is itself unknown. In fact, identifying anything is nearly impossible, as the void is almost completely unknown, and thus things are hard to distinguihs -for where is there truly space between- nor is the actual trunk of things entirely known, both in virtue of science, but also in our understanding of the soil. And by my station, furthering science is no way to solidify the truth in which it comes from. All it does in fact, is allow us to ask questions, in that we can be clear on what things we are trying to understand the basis for; and, of the possibilities in origin, so can their own basis have an output to be considered against.

            The stature of our epic seems clear. The year is currently 2024. Mars has not been reached, nor has rockety been advanced to a reusable point. Moreover, in a fair sense, if Mars was reached, so would it take several years for this and any sizable return to happen. Then, for a significant colony to be established, would take even longer, decades perhaps. Further than that, for it to be some what of a nation, or country, is one which has fair limits in the nature of the endevour -and is thus not some novel land for soverign competion- and thus seems limited to an astounding million folk -who are all likely engineers, officers, techincinas etc. "For who else would tour for 8 months to reach mars." 
            <br>&emsp;Then there is the future of earth, in that it is not incresingly common for the unlikley threat of an asteroid to be insurmountable. Nor, by virtue of the law, will computing and technology be novely violent or terroizing. There may be wars, but I point to the evaporation of antiquated views and motives, and the already current diplomacy of the world -whos realistic and otherwise unemotioal co-operation seems to reflect our solidiarty in fighting the real threat of nature and her elements. By that, it seems that the bones of society will emerge, and that from our sensibility, so will it be goverend with appropriate measures -and all while in the custom of states. The threat of mass nuclear use seems to be small and waining, nor do I have any current regard for a lethally widespread virus. Climate change is current, though beyond our actual resolve to deal with it -be it thorugh industry to mitigate and reverse, or our fortitude as to bear the consequences- so are the effecs here one of scars and trauma, but no apocalypse. "As I suspect, it will only wound our statistics: which, as far as I a concerned, is the case in all scenarios, including war. And if it reaches a nuclear point, or something esle truly disatrous, then so will our regards wean from the path of life, and to that of death."
            <br>&emsp;It seems that from our present view, that considering the relation (and quality) of the state with the exepcted developments of cultute and tech is hard. But following general princniples, or concerning those which have fair anticiaption by virtue of our current path, will relinquish any current fears. For, the Blade Runner effect is harsh, in that, from an emotioanal point of view, so is a year or two away so far, and prone to be hazy and alarming -and further decades at that. 
            <br>&emsp;Where our tale begins though is in year not so far away, but one where, following the advent of more accesible space travel, and the pairing of a more novel objective in it with a humanist collective choosen to particpate, so is a far time ahead -by virtue of space flight- one suitable for recollection. For one, predictions can be effectively made, for if one left right now even, and with a given of cryo sleep, and the certain millenai thats gone, so can discourse be had as to how those behind faired in the centuries ahead. Secondly, as that by the (scripted) virtue of those who left, and the roots of their heart, so can that be comparable to our current classical view. Right now, we read Plutarch and Emerosn, who are millenia, if not at least a century or two old. And by that account, as we find little of worth in our current day, so could we presume the century or two that followed to be nothing short of that -besides those who were in fact as original as those in the past, and thus made our present as origiunal. But so, in those, be it uniquely interesting or merely so in a private sense, so could we say that of that which is presently sincere and pure, so could our 'travelling selves' remark upon that; which is to say, that by their family lineage perhaps, or at least being memebrs of a group who cherrish things from a far past -which film and contemporay mediums include- so can the actual gifts (and or current treasures of real antiquity) be relished upon by those in this millenia ahead. And by that, so can our current remarks reflect those from ahead: as, per their motives, so are our interests the same. [By virtue of this story, I can not predict which games or film will come out in the decades ahead. But, practically, our interests lie in literature and more legacied art (such as music). Lord of the Rings for instance, holds a reptuable sway as being a landmark film of its kind; and from the decades that have in fact followed, those films (and thus none of its caliber) are made. Music is similar, in that the cream of the crop generally comes from films of that early era. "Music is not so important though, and so, as a adjacent quality, so is its true merrit (by us humanists) one of passivity, or engagement at least by those who are already made -as comapred to that which seeks to strenghten us, or relieve us."]
            <br>&emsp;On that note, I live on Alpha 9, and it is indeed the end of the millenia. Planetary imaging does in fact show many suitable planets within such light years; but only some of them are sufficient, or preferbale at that. [By virtue of the allegory, ought it have some colorfull shades. We made up then, that there was advances in imaging that showed (where it would not before) water. And by that, we found a planet with something comparable to an ocean; and although it was not clear, there was some fauna, things akin to birds and bees; but no real predators or threats. At least, we just wanted some green in our tale, and appropriated it to more common truths whereby microbes were present and had grown, and the earliest of plants were present -along with an atmosphere which offered snow on the mountains, and rain.] Indeed, there are several planets like this that can be reached in many centuries of grazing travel; and our groups, 'The Masons' were selected -amongst several others. My father, held many of the teachings and principles of his father, and his before him -each being tought to be themselves [by virtue of that, with each holding the core offer of what the fruits of such development gave, offered as well the sensibility, assessment and skill to reach such state. And based on the maturity and peace within that, so were the roots of the family laid.]
            <br>&emsp;And so we lay there, on the souther edge of the Bayron valley, amidst of brethren and folk. And while there, we go about our lives, appropriate ourselves to goverenance, and also the mark in which they are appointed to bear authority -in other words, what we deserve ourselves. And, importantly, we remark upon and further substantiate ourselves as men. "Almost by the pure station of our common practice of writing letters, do we sustain and thrive. For at least when were wrong or unsure, we can orient ourselves with such marshalled acuity. And arranging ourselves around what is right is one that bears us the fruits of the fairest excess -for we never stop having won, or having lost. For our aim in life is reflective of the means in which we procure it, which, according to our sought measure of joy, and its according domain of practice and experinece, remarks our own formative efforts to afford this: which, in a way, relates to one who's objective is to see the stars, and thus amend, happily, to the committment of calibrating the telescope. Such a process bears us a felcitiy in life, peace towards death, and otherwise amicable appraoch towards our end: and thus a path of little conflict -as none needs but what can be earned, received, given by themselves. As, in the ripe state which our dearest pleasure comes from, so is commradery, kindness, receptivity and strenght naturally common." For such a reason, we were one of the collectives selected.

        <div id="dearbrutality">
            All I wish is to better suppose the reality of things; as, beyond my strucutral knowledge, so are the bevy of instances and expereinces particular to them, unknown.
            <br>&emsp;And, for example, my aim is to remove this prevalence of our value or impression of pains and suffering that  bear their source from things akin to fiction or nightmares; while otherwise embracing the sincerity and uniqueness of a man hit by shrapnel, 'or a boy whos eyes have been similarly injured'. I just stiltily hate this blank imagery, of victims and perpetrators, of bad people's and those helpless. Crime riddles its head here, as theres this gratuitous notion of being picked apart; nor is torture and subjection much different. These are not off in terms of their material, as men surely have been ripped to pieces, or brutually brought down. But so is the order of such strides one that our suppostion can only fill. Imagery, harsh sensation, shallow minded presumption and or validity is no strong measure, for me at least.
            <br>&emsp;And from there, I seek at least that most bright and full freedom, whereby we can rest on our own laurels and fortune, as our ignornace is not to what is in fact all around, and sincere. 
            <br>&emsp;These regards though hold their limits. For we are not in fact conducting a survey, or lookig to depict every death. As the surgeon said, 'all the men shuttered at the thought of tomorrow, when their charge would be in the face of grapeshot, cannister and straigh shots'. I can only suppose the harshness of the injuries; but so is my purpose not to then say that war is bad; but rather understand how they got to this place, the actual variety of their expereince, and otherwise sink in this otherwise gratuitous severity, by nourishing our fright with the chartered conduct, fortitude, plainess, and simple humanity of men. This does not bother me then, be it in sacrifice, battery or eviceration. "I only mean to not let these frigid sights paint my view of how common days are experiened, or that of the meanness and ball-headedness of men."
            <br>&emsp;As I'd put it, the military is arranged into divisions, each of which form an army. Of these parts, there are groups, which are themselves formed of sections (and their according members). Detailing the destinies and affairs for each level marks the hardest thing; for on one hand you must contend with those who actually recieve the shells of perill; while otherwise resting on the knowledge of others luck, or at least fairer experience. The purpose then of these regards, is to remove all but the practical interest of men, and to remove their swashbuckling and or mobbish buffoonery. And secondly, to allow one to be hit by hell, and in all suffering about, to bear that epxerience on their own accord, thorugh their strenght, splitting away; all the while though, that someone going through the same thing beside, is but a mile away, 'as if the sight of each were beginning to fade, and thus even one at arms distance could not longer be seen'. By that is a man's indivudla expereince dealt.
            <br>&emsp;Our ignornace fairs me some shortcomings when it comes to how certain traumas are supposed; but so in the affairs of life are all under the same reign; and by those who deal it and those who recieve, beyond the explicit share of life's universal current, so can we say, happily, that it is not imagery, vibrance or tales that fairly describe such event; and by that, 'if even all beyond me were expereincing the grimmace of hell, so couldn't I know, rightly at least'. 
            <br>&emsp;In a word, there is a child at the moment, who is dying, or at least is in turmoil, and likely due to some congenial heart deffect. Their mother is wheeping, as our those giving aid with their own pang of sympathy. "But I declare forwardly, that the equal instance of another, be it near or in a world far and unknown, is not to be compounded together, and in that deal us (as the viewer) dread. For that overhwlming feeling of fear, piercing sympathy and otherwise incoming dread, is the wound of those who see people actually hurt. And it is our view, as ones upright and seeing, that need to marshal themselves freely, as not to let the frontiers of their viciosu sight become characterized and cluttered."
            <br>&emsp;I simply believe that none, in private even, expereince things on some island. And, in the snese of an individual expereincing what they can, so is this not a isolated expereince -and in that one of capture by those dealing- but simply one whereby the actual toil of the expereince rubs against our own instrument. "We all breathe the same air, but struggle to breathe on our own. Its as if were joined together, but theres a problem inside: and even if someone were brutishly dealing it to us, so would our actual sight be governed from the outside and in: as if we knew not how or where, but saw the deep throbbs at the bottom of us, while we stood from the top, looking in."
            <br>&emsp;The worlds just messy, you see. For we live in a time which is not riddled with conflict, but natural severity. But so too in older times, would it still be hard to describe the conflicts happening. For where to they exactly happen, and of what propensity does this occur, in regions lets say. And by that, who is in fact desposed from such conflict? And by virtue of the conflicts purpose, that those more striclry invovled would in fact bear pain, or the threat at least, as a cost to the object which their efforts serve. Civilians are hardly innocent, in their treatment, but so musn't we confuse the strategic burning  of buildings and supplies with the mutilation of civilians; nor, ought the assualt of a women and her rape, be a stain against all men, or soliders at that. "And fairly, by the pace of all interactions, would those who act poorly towards those in charge, receive then a fairly, and however escalating punishment." And overall, if we have some sense of this in Rome, or on the Virginia road in 1863, or on route to Luxemburg from Franfurt in 1916, so ought we not let the senstivitiyes of this, or at least the subjects which were dealing with on a more base and common level, be awkwardly applied and conflated in areas that hold similar material, but lack any grounding familiarity -such as the wars and conflict in China, or the americas. For I find, almost pleasingly, that the letters and first hand accounts of soliders and their days through Germany, through the southern states, or all tracks and between which invovle conflict, to be more digestible than if we otherwise inferred what was likely -on the basis of what conflict is- but to a place which has no grounding substnace or material. "In other words, its much easier to see someone get hit here, or another get hit there, then to pciture, or imagine at least, what it'd be like in some far off place, where my own reading and mind is effectively not." 
            <br>&emsp;This is the greatest way of thinking, for a man whos been terribly injured is both not you, or the author likely, but not the assialant (who by further discretion is the same) or other commrades about; and being there, first hand, if even a reflection by the patient in question, bears palpable and graspable detail and strides; which itself bears a more rounded, respectably seen and otherwise definite and thus limited view of misfortune, but also, as accounts usually depict, and otherwise reflect what your own definite view fairs, of the sturdiness, reason and might by which such difficulty and pain is dealt with. "And by that, things are never so bad, or if they are they are not so common; and so much as they are explicit, and rampant at that, so is it onto men, from other men, who loyal, and of those in a way confused, act in corresponding ways, and to a drowning end. But so are we privialged folk bare in our own understaning and thus view of others subject to its immediacy, of death, and how those who were brave enough to surrender themselves and fight, could lose."
            <br>&emsp;I cannot speak about civil assaults, or the further extension of that into death; nor is the severity of criminality something which I can plainly speak about, be it of the mob or the bandits and lords of Africa. What I can say, is that the material which these folk are privy to does not neccessiate, or by a mature lens, correspond with any explicit and or brazen view that such folk are in fact bufoonishly inhumane, unreaosnable, morons, bullies of the worst sort, and otherwise not people themsevles, acting with an objective and organized (and faithfull) accordingly, and that by punishment, poor treatment, or the callously conceived (in terms of how common) sadism and menace (of given misery), so are they all, be it up or down, as all men are, that as such they are natured, rooted pure, and to our own foreing sympthay subject to their confusion, and fear. "And to all you pundants out there, how dare you, with all ignorance, or supscially lack there of, if you even were mature, but to then have no reproach, or stubborn reason that all are in fact pure, that you think they like it, that they simply dont care, and bear suffering to others for their own manichail impulse. But I say to thee, that you lack insight and solidity to your own life: for if you did, you would know that all others hold the mold for the same: and that it is truly fear and confusion which has them act as they do, be it to the leader of a group, or their (leader) own subjection to Gods and the whole of men. But stop your maligning of people, who appear even slightly murderous and putridly devout; for these images your offering seem more like charcters, antagonists, villains, cartoons. At least offer the gratuities given and the perrils recieved under the explicit case of the sun setting and the moon rising; are not this misfortuiens given during a day, lit or not? And of that, are their not proceedings, or fibres and knottings to these happenings? For you are left otherwise with the juvenile depiction of a medieval heretic being lit on fire; only, you forget that such an end is his sentence, and that by such decree, he did not have to ask for a following breakfast: for of such a sentence, following the conclusion of the crime, so was the finaility of it set (no sooner) than the next day. And even then, if the order was given for that spot as it stands, so were the guards who brought the victim to the stake, not drunken grizzly fools, laughing and mocking as they brought him to his place. Nor did their chesire smill and wickedly hooked nose bow over to the man, and whisper something ratish and brutal."
        </div>
        <div id="withoutcause">
            What are we to do then? There is no war in our country, nor that of the world? Their is crime and tyrranny, but of a increasingly local sort? 
            <br>&emsp;I have a problem with feeling lucky, for their is a fear which is awardly childish, or at least all to gruelling in the compressed sypathies of others who appear less likley -or privilage to run away. But I see the world otherwise. Still, there is not a lack of bad, nor are we fair, in saying what things do happen, how they more than supposedly do. But we are in a tricky scenario then. For I can rest a little easy knowning that all of this is due to fear, and accordingly a lack of proper insight as to what our more sensible state would oblige. But so are we merely strucutred in that way, and hardly immune ourselves -of those civil misfortunes. But I cant quite figure out how to feel alright with things, when there is crime, violence, purjury, rape, disease, trauma and accidents; variably placed, and decreasingly so in those kinds which are more vicous. But so are those things a world away; nor am I afraid to rest on our own laurels of insight, and how such vicous ends are not overwhelmingly distinct in those foreing lands. It is econmonc issues and AIDs which saturate Africa, not the lawless bends of crime. And although war holds expereinces which are brutal, so is it not but an affair of the lands which host the fighting. The Americas werent privy to the world wars, nor were the homelands of South and East Asia, or Austrlia. And at that, beyond the direct combat areas in norhter europe, there were surely many folk who did escape; and at least, if they didnt, it was through not being submissive to those were passing through. How is Africas part in all of that not of that way? Particularly those in the south. There are places that are fighting, and historically there have been more. But so are there domestic disputes, local crimes, and besides the unviseral groove of natures condition, so is there common shortcomings, or emotions, that even the most fortiune of us find. Yet what are we to suppose in all of this? Is it some idealist reform, or aid at least -be it specific, as in being a fireman, or on a broader scale, as offering more poltiical service? I dont knonw. I suspect if I did not know otherwise, then my own life would be enough. And at that it surely is, for my self, family, friends, job, and natural end of illness and death, is a task that I must follow. Yet were idle, or at least resting on our privialge, and more daintily following our whims. Admittedly, the freedom of this state is one that addresses the remaining condition, or at least requirments to make the most lively use of our freedom. But so is that our fair, in that we are rihgt and ready to promulgate our views and vision: but so is the worlds, or at least our perceive view of toil, an awkard purpose in which the objects of such ends align. There may not be much what I could do, nor am I being asked to, and condemed at that. In fac, it is more common for me not to make better use of my time for my gain. Morover, my sincere view is one where the demands for full living is further known by many, for that is a remedy I also lack. But the crimes of Africa, the death of children, naturally or by unequal quality, is something which I am unobliged to view: but also not aware of a prompt which were refusing. That may be then, and ultimatley, as I suppose, that on the edge of gratuirity, or that of natural disease, so are those folks braver and stronger than I am, who is merely well off enoguh to be aware of it, but too idle, or aimless at least, not to be bothered -whereby in my reproach from such ends, I see all, as if to make sure that the prevlance of such bad is not.

            I would describe man like this. He has come, from the annals of behavior, to the collectives at every point and the following nationaliszing, and by virtue of this updraft of community, and the adjacency to others doing the same, that conflict with those adjacents continued through all of antiquity and into the transition from old to modern times. Religions role is paramount, as its motive held a core bearing on early modern conflict; and that by the propogration of that, so were the solidifying powers of Europe full of such momentum. By virtue of their more liberal progression, so did their roots as powers amongst other powers remain. And by that, the world wars which we so grievingly look back on, are but the pinnacles of that European conflict. In that, for simplicity, there is the natural treatment of trauma, the unfair yet orderly ends of those outside the military; and otherwise, there is the unnatural but rather gratuitous treatment of folk, be it fighters or standbyers. I will not comment on the preavlence, or severity at least of this ruthless marbling; but so can we compare the  inpact of shrapnel or a bullet, and the gouging of ones eyes, or further discomfort imparted onto those already in anguish. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, I see that our current place is one of nearly full liberality; whereby the balance of power is not a common or enacted stance, but one of diplomacy (through over arcing institutions), international trade, and the positied poeace through democracy and its spread thorugh states -as monarchies tned to go to war more, and are at  least seen as more dangerous. By that count, we can see how the times of old were more hostile due to their empirical nature, and that this is really but a more populated form of a chief leader of a tribe. "Tribes fight, as their own stature is extremely vertical and bare, and so all those around press upon eachother. And the monarchies of France, Germany and England were so relatively high, that the awarenss of each, for rooted aggression or conceived pre-emptivness in their security, bore the conflict."
            <br>&emsp;By that, we have something different than that of tribes, and thus the times of old. For in that, I'd describe such a scenario as an association of folk, led however, that in regards to their group, 'it is us, our arrangment, our customs and ends, and all others, those outside and beside us, passing by for which we are on guard, or coming in to which we respond, and followingly, with future distrubance in mind, take the fight to them'. This is not the wares of man though, but those misguided by reason. "As if children with the faculties of true men, but letting it poorly or at least innaccutely sway their otherwise primitive impulse." Now, in comparison, it seems that 'us' is surrmoutnable to all; and that by that there is no other. We've no superstitous regard, and thus have a soul commonality, or at least abscence of private (and thus seperate) core aims. And, in plain terms, the bones of our liberal age, having quickly solidifed following the fruits of the prior era, is one that remarks the strides and placement of those keen, and at  least becoming of real men. "Where there is no seperating line between us."

            Suppose I took two numbers, 1 and 1, and added them togehter; then, I added the second term of the latter with this current term, being 1 and 2 -the total now being three. 
            <br>&emsp;Instead of showing the signs of operation (in both the addition and equation), lets us simply assume the operations, and place the terms beside one another -and beyond single digits, we place a coma. From there, you have 11, then 112, followed by 1123 and 11235 -to which you'd sum 3 and 5 to get 8, and have a series (or sequence) of 112358.
            <br>&emsp;Now for some sugar. Take a binary number line, and at each subsequent spot (or term\index) you have a 1 followed by a 0. And so, if I asked what value (or number) was at the 10th spot, you'd say 1, and thus the 11th was 0. These are irrespective values, as per a normal counting line, their count does not match the otherwise normal increase of the index. A trinary line operates the same, as do quarterny and so on. It may indeed be true that typical binary and things of the like do not traditionally operate like this, but for our purposes the explanation (or description rather) fits. For what we are aiming to do, is take these irrespective values, and use them as a scale by which our normal operations are measured against. In that way, the value we have will only be that of the number line were using -at least it will only be within that range.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, you can imagine it like this. If I took the common number of 9, and supposed its place at the same spot of 9, and then added 3, both would increase comparably. But what if the line of operations was limited to 9 itself? Adding 3, we would still be at the 12th point (or spot), but so would the value not be so. You see, as a trinary line goes 1,2,3, so does it then go back, or proceed rather, to 1,2,3 again, whereby the normal spots from 1-9 would be 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3. A clock works similarly, in that of the 24 hours in a day, so are there only 12 values, which repeat themselves as you go from the first to the second half of the day. "And at any rate, even if there were 24 hours on the clock (to match the amount of the day), so would the day repeating lead the subsequrny values to do the same - 22,23,24, 1,2,3.....22,23,24."
            <br>&emsp;Returning to our main purpose, where we take those supposed starting numbers and operate on them, so will you find that doing so on an iterating number line, that of the series as it begins from those supposed numbers, so will the appropriate operations to the itertaive number line lead to those numbers again. "And as presentations go, and of what people say, 'I will simply show, rather than continuing to babble along'."
            <br>&emsp;Take two starting values, be it 1 and 1, and operate on them through a 9 step number line -binary is 2 step, a standard clock is 12. Beginning with 1 and 1, we get 2, then add 1 and 2 to get 3, and those latter two to get 5, and that with 3 to get 8. Here, the big guns lie. For whichever point we are at, so are we displaying, or resulting rather, based on the values. As the line of operation is 9 step, so will 8 added to 5 bring us to 6,7,8 and 9, and as this is the cap (or degree of the line rather), we simply proceed (as if referring to scale -like a ruler), whereby the followng step is to 1, then 2 then 3, and having done 7 already, we add one more to reach 4. By that, our series looks like 112358 -> 1123584. 
            <br>&emsp;There are indeed variations of this, and further ways that greater number lines require us to display, but so will I reach my shining point. Following the current set, 8 plus 4 brings us 3, which then sums to 7, and that to 1; then 8 is reached and a peak value of 9. Since this is the edge, all that is added will simply be itself, since by virtue of repition, the space after the beginning is akin to following 0; and by that, 9 adds to 8 to get 8 itself, and then 8 adds to 9 to get 8 again; these two add to get 7, which adds to 8 to get 7, and that to 6 to get 4, followed by 1,5, 6 then 2, to 8,1,9: and as you can see, 9 added to 1 brings us to 1, which adding to 9 bears us 1 as well, and our series has repeated. 
            <br>&emsp;Bringing it all together in one fair line, is 112358437189887641562819. By our hope at least, victory has come.
            <br>&emsp;Now, this remarks the core tenent of our thought. In any case, if I were to have discovered relativity, and done so through pure observation, I might offer some of those which were initial, and use them to explain the mechaincs by which such phenomena occured -and I would do this to the degrre that I could offer this explanation. But, beyond the actual cogs and principles, lies our further observations, 'whereby the theory of everytthing goes beyond the mere shine of a lightbulb, but that of the stars'. So let us explore the cosmos
            <br>&emsp;For simplciity sake, I well grant myself the means to demosntrate the series that would otherwise seem unfamiliar and unintuitive, but under the working principles already given. By that, we have seen that taking an initia pair of numebrs, operating on them, and of the product, adding it to the latter of the prior two, with a 9 step line in mind, brings us naturally back to those starting numbers. This is a run as we call them, or a series and or sequence. But in trying other runs of a similar sort, we start with 22 or 77, and by that create set, or collection. Then, we may alter the starting pairs into trios, or quads, and following the same rules, merely adjust the range in which we include the prior terms to operate. So starting with 444 (on 9 step), we'd sum this to 8 plus 4, which then becomes 3, and thus our sequence looks like 4443, which then becomes 44432, then 444329 and so forth. This remarks a kind of series, in that all are trios or pairs etc. Further than that, we can then look at the collections, or sets of these runs, and line them up in a cardinal way, or something random. Not, to be clear in that we'd go 11,22,33,44,55 and turn that into 11,33,44,22,55, rather we'd have less orderly and cardinal starting pairs, such as 12,67,83; and in this, we find, that of those runs in any particular kind, so do they return to themselves in an equal amount of steps -this happens through all pairs, trios and quads of cardinal and random sequences.
            <br>&emsp;Following this though we reach the notion of class, whereby we take our number line, or scale rather, and alter that, upon which we then operate. In that, we have been using 9 steps, which is to say that every 9 temrs, places or points, the values reset -akin to a clock and its own 12 repeating steps. As to keep things simple and in line with assumed operations -112358 as comapred to 1,2,3,5,8, nor 1+1=2+1+3+2=5, etc.- we use symbols, letters or characters to represent values over two digits; hereby, the value of ten simply becomes 'A', with eleven being 'B' and so forth. This allows us to mark number lines and according values over nine, but keep everything to single terms. As it were, using a ten step, we would begin with 112358, and going 5 points over, go from 8 to 9, then to 10, and 3 more to 3; and, indeed, if we reached 10 itself, then so would we just put 'A'. This is more more of an explanaion than is required, but describes the class of number lines nonetheless.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, sets of each kind within each class, produce results that are thematically identical. In a 5 step line for instance, all pairs will repeat at the same point as all other pairs do, as will trios do the same. This is so, to be clear, that within each class, the kinds will repeat at the same spot as other runs of that kind, within that class. For instance, in the 9 step line, pairs repeat every 24 terms, while trios do so every 40. In the 5 step, the pairs repeat every 12 terms, and trios every 20. The comparions is thematic then, and all be it from the same mechanical principle, only so to the ends made by the angle in which those principles are acted on -via the varyiny classes, or number lines.
            <br>&emsp;In addition to that, there are themes shared within sets across all classes. As a preface, when we make a set were basically stacking sequences ontop of one another; and in that, we can look at the columns created at each point (or index). Foremost amongst all my obversvations, is that, assuming the set is cardinal in its order and mirrored in its starting values -- meaning 11 instead of 14, and of that, 11,22,33 instead of 11,33,22- we find that, from the top run down, that at any point, the same value will produce an equal column as other points with the same (top) value. For instance, in 9 step, 11-99, the 7th column begins at 4 (being the 6th term in the 11(top) sequence); from here down, the series is 483726159. Looking at the 17th spot, with 4 at the top, the series running down is the same. What is interesting is two fold. For starters, these values reached are done so, in effect, by calculating each individal run, and merely lining them up; and in doing so, what stacks to be a certain run (vertically) at the 7th spot, does so equally at the 17th. The 9th spot which holds 7, is the same as the 15th spot with 7: same columns running down. And so does this repeat for every column of every value, and with an equal nature in our kinds of sets, and within other classes. Secondly though remarks the whole number analog to this sequences. For instance, if we made a series of 5 plus 5s, we'd normally have 5,10,15,20,25 and so on. Now, in the 9 step cardinal set, the 5 column runs 516273849. This is a summed version of that whole 5 set, in that if you took that set 5,10,15,20... and summed each value, you'd have 5,1,6,2, which is indeed the sequence that our set naturally creates. To be clear, taking a whole number, 25 in this case, and putting it into a value based on a number line, merely shows how many iterations of the number line have passed, and the current spot within the current iteration. Arithematic wise, you simply minus the value so far reached in the current iteration, and that is your value, and however many times the line cap (or ordinacne as we calll it), divides into the remainnig whole number is your number of iterations (or degree). By that, 25, goes to 18, which means that 9, or the cap, has been reached twice, and is 7 steps in. In terms of our series and sets we dont care about the iteration or degree, but value only; and by that, 25 yeilds us the value of 7. This is refferred to as summing, whereby we take a whole number and 'sum' it into a value correspndant with a repeating number line. In the prior case though, we see, that instead of taking the 5 plus set, and summing each term, we merely reach what would be the same sequence in doing so by naturally stacking our 9 step runs. Moreover, if you look at the whole 5 plus set, you can use our iterative scale at that point to, whereby 5 plus 5 is 1, plus 5 is 6, plus 5 is 2, which reahes 7, then 3. And what this shows, is that the sequence of adding 5s can be done in whole terms, then summed as to reach what would be otherwise produced by adding under that iterative scale; and of that iterative result, so does it naturally occur when creating our cardinal set.
            <br>&emsp;<br>&emsp;Simply, Sums is the proccess of adding terms together within the scale of an iterating number line. A clock, for instance, iterates, in that a 7Oclock shift which runs 8 hours long, goes to 3Oclock. This clock is 12 steps, as per that amount of terms or points, the value repeats. And within that, our operations bring patterns. Practically, we work with single character values, whereby all iterations 9 and under will be single digit; while, those over, will simply be represented with a letter; which, in effect, means that 10, for instance -and being represented by 'A', marks the 10th spot on a line; while, 11, would be shown as B, and, following the 10th (as shown by A) is the 11th. In that, we add terms together on a number line of a certain amount of places (or spots), and of the kind which repeats. And, thus, within that, upon summing to numbers which surpass the height of the iteration, so does the product value amount to something smaller. "1oclock plus 9 hours is 10oclocl; add 4 hours to that, and the value is 2."
            <br>&emsp;Now, suppose you took two starting values, of 1 and 1, and for simplciity sake, we display this with an assumption in mind, whereby the characters are placed beside one another, and we presume that there is an addition between them, and from a given number line. Then, adding the two, we show the product of this and put it as the next step in the series. Beginning then with 11, we get 112, then 1123 to 11235 and 112358. Now, using a 9 step line -a clock with 9 hours- when adding 5 and 8 we get 4, and then when summnig 8 and 4 we get 3. Continuing the sequence we go 11235843718988764156281911. And as you can see it naturally repeats. This is the hallmark of sums, in that, taking starting values, showing them with assumed operations (11235 as opposed to 1+1=2+1=3+2=5), and on a repeating number line, so will any arrangment of starting starting numbers repeat, and with the same amount of steps as those which start with the same amount of places. That is, if we begin with 44, and go to 448, so will this repeat to 44 at the same point as 88 will, and 34 and 71 at that. But if we take 111, and add the foremost three values, getting 1113 to 1135, so will 111 repeat, and at the same spot as 222 and 459. And, indeed, 1111 and 4324 are the same. To be clear, it takes a certain amount of steps for 11 to repeat, and that any two digit starting sequence will repeat at the spot; and of three and fours, so will they repeat like all other threes and other fours; but the point in which each kind repeats is unqiue to that kind. "All twos repeat at a given point, as do threes and fours at their own." However, when we look at other number lines, or classes, so do the same rules apply, whereby in 5 step lines so will the doubles repeat at the same spot as eachother, and threes and fours the same; but that these, compared to those doubles, threes and fours in 7 point lines, have different equal repeat points as the doubles, threes and fours of outher classes. The theme, or principle rather, is all that they

            Theres nothing that holds less doubt, than my view that violence is the soul threat. Neccessarily it would seem; as neither I or anyone who complaines, seems concerned about the death of children, the eldery, the impoverished, nor do we question (besides associating it with broader critiques) the cogs and function of our laws and services.
            <br>&emsp;I believe what frightens any of us is putridity, vilness and vice. Severity may invoke similar feelings, but these are such as we deem fair, or natural rather. By that, as childrens death seem normal, so is anything expected like that disregarded. Instead, we look at displays of mistreatment, or the unruly destruction of hordes and fiends. This is fair, yet it rests on no appropriate scale. Which is to say that of what is overhwlemingly true, so does this not merely hold its place, but becomes the color of all.
            <br>&emsp;Personally, I wish to rely on our own view, and one which is in fact all accouting, and sturdy and light in its congruence with others inflammed opinions. As it were, the world is remarked upon through a supposed scale, as only God knows every leaf and injury. By this, there is no general merrits, nor is there a fixated point; for the latter is in fact a mere stretch of the former, while it is not but those which compose it. Simply, the cut and dry approach, whereby we generalize of fixate, holds no definite ground; at  least, so much as we would suitbaly regard, so would there be no inmalleable lines. By this, there is no other, no them, no groups, nor are we different, seperate, but united, like the currents in the ocean, hills and mountains running through the land. Substantiating this is the prescence of these folk, who, like water running down, or bees seeking honey, walk, commit, relate, refute, defend, struggle and at any rate find trouble, but in ways that are not narrative, nor ignored. In a word, coral reefs describe our lives, and the world is full of them. "Only those who put things in a bubble, break our othewise suttle appeal, and provide us with a neccessary brace to our sought understanding." 
            <br>&emsp;All in all, I can see that there are dying children, friends and family who are ill, nor a lack of civil alltercations, or societal conflicts at that. But we must let those relevant to the scenario act themselves. This is a foregin concept, but one that is still local to our regard. This is the symptom of biggots and opinion, as they muddle what you'd otherwise suspect regarding lands far and unknown. We can say, that in our own country, or those lands abroad, that of the conflict, it is done by men to men, and through the vastness of time. In those effects, there is a range of severity, with a layer of vice, vileness and putridity. Our thinking indeed needs fairer terms to distinguish while remaing hole, but so, in our own obligate ways, are we subject to our personal neccessity, the brace of others flurriedness by our own sensibility, and, at any rate, the appropraite remark of the world, in so much as it is poor, and in which varying manners, to the effect that there is not simply great or grizzled bad, nor at home or in some place other. Theres so many locations for things to occur, nor are the worst treatments dealt withouth prior times of struggle, and much neutral time between; nor, is severity the mark of our apprheension; as I cannot prevent the death of a soldier, the attack on a freeman, or rape of a girl; but I can remark upon their likelihood, and remove the horrid-just distinction, and by that, bear witness to degrees of severity, but without any overhwhelming vice, and less so even of vilenss and putridity especillay. 
            <br>&emsp;There is not this whole which needs patching, but rather an eon of roots which hold beliefs of people and their principles in chains; to the effect that communites, states, nations, and the global congress, must work to agree with the good that all humans share, and otherwise remove the strict influence and grief that antiquated ways hold. We can be thankfull, almost globally, that such a situation has occured. By this, I believe our distcontent settles on our own life, and how the curiosity and care we have, is drug down by more idle fears; but so are these, at least when were next to them, reminiscent of certain abscences of knowledge. Which to be fair, are not needed when we are moving and free; but so much as we come to a more slow and vulnerable time, I can at least acocunt for the stability we lack. Namely is the influence of the press, journalists, news and movies, or the media rather. There are all kinds, and none fear the impression dealt to those watching sports. But the discourse and integrity of content which 'information' sources spew, is quite unsettling. And, admittedly, our own status removes much of the sense that their impact is strong; but so are we missing any real sense of its breadth, or distance rather. Knwoing things at any rate can alleviate all concern, for we are present and thus beyond any regard for what others may thinnly say; but at least, certain aspects can reflect the reality of their spread, namely the demographics of those who watch the news, expereince twitter, primarily; and contrasting that with the prevalence of other habits, more or less (as I suspect and have some evidence), shows that the degree of these outlets impact is small. But I must learn this, rather than suppose. As is the case for other types of data, as they too remove worries which our reserved nature toils with. Namely, that by removing this condensed and foreign view, so is there no fear of general suffering -which appeals to whats foreign, and is otherwise entire of that. Moreover, things of an even vile and putrid sort, hold some adjacent insigfhts to actual happenings, but at any rate, as the whole is given less 'foregin' regards, so are the various pieces then subject to what could only be described as 'working', and 'common'. For, as you see how many people live all but over the toil of nature's claims, so is it easy to see how their is no presumed violence or altercations. Its similar to the conduct of war, in how, of those invovled, there is so much time in between; and in that, you see who they are amidst the broader conflict, which gives a finer impressions of their actions while fighting; and having similar contact which those times, makes the world feel together but broad; and I find that our pinning down on possible occurences comes from not being privy to the expereince of so many, who in fact warrant little of that possibility.
            <br>&emsp;I just want to go my way. And in which world it is the one I see, full and with integrity. Rather than declare this, as if to oppose another, I will rely on it, as if we are privy to an enormous bound of truth, by which we are fine to be and treat ourselves small; in that, lies the road between us, and one of ours to treat. Perhaps I wish to remove our justification, as if there is a problem, and turn my head thus from that which comes from a small view, while otherwise settling into our stretch of the real one

            My will is no longer in secret, as if we are kept from the world and our time.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, we once held a sort of freedom, but one of which was unmitigated by any serious matter.
            <br>&emsp;As we grew, so did our oblige grow, but to our hearts dismantle. There simply was nothing more I could concern myself with, then removing the symptoms of poorly dealing with our task.
            <br>&emsp;It seems, in short, that as the age has gone on, we held no stake in anything but our deliberations.
            <br>&emsp;By that, we never could settle onto the pleasure that we had, but were instead ushered into other regards. Doing so then, brought us to seek other comforts and desires, either as a compliment to these committments, or the relief in our frustration of seeking them, but failing to succeed.
            <br>&emsp;Now, I can say that I am a man. For I certainly know not all, but we are so unafraid, that I can say that there is no more pushing force; or in other words, those wishes and dreams that were born of seperate aims, is no longer confused and begreiving. We can simply try, and otherwise be present.
            <br>&emsp;What I can say though, is that the linens of desire are not so removed, and that as I become more secure and able in our true prescence, so do I feel the most obscure threats to that equally obscure desire of mine. No matter what those are, but I can say, for one, that violence, or at least the suffering and injury of animals and foregin folk begreives me; as if our fortuned state seeks to run free, but pangs at the ignorance of others pain. This fear, or pang of sympathy, is there to be clear, in that upon our freedom so are we afraid, in that our furthest desires are then drawn out as to be (as we can) addressed or removed, which is itself intruding. But I have indeed remedied this by reading memoirs from soldiers, be it German, Union, surgeons. And by that, theres a pace to life whereby the gratuity of men is on no horrid display; nor, the recipeinets of chaos done so through constant and unmitigating demise. "Movies and our shifting mind have shown us otherwise." 
            <br>&emsp;There is a more complex doubt though, or scrutiny rather, and that has to do with our duty in society, and the benefit we feel poor to not offer. Posteriy and glory are a core part of this, in that we are afraid, that by virtue of their abscence, so will our life be normal. But so are we equally afraid, or concerned rather, that upon our removal from the public realm, that so will the world go to hell, and all our insight gone to waste. Learning how many people there and their natural condition does remove some of this, as we see how vast and far the issues and or workings of the world are, and by that we are not really asked but little, or expected at least; nor is the basis for our worry so founded, in that the broader the realm seems, the less clear and obivous the problems and solutions are. Moreover, we can see that there are many people already serving the many points of interest. "And so it feels less like were abandoning a sinking ship."
            <br>&emsp;At any rate I see how our prescence is enough, in that by addressing our effort and activity as if the whole world were watching, at least, as if thorugh diolague, we are concerning ourselves by a standard that measures the entire judgement of them, so are we amidst, and together in some way. In a word, procrastination occurs when we are so seeking the end, but doubtfull of our ability to succeed, and so we prepare; yet, if our wants are not so tied to what we'd otherwise do by our common stride, then so can we take risks, or do so at  least with more openesss and regularity. I think, for instance, that relations are built this way, in that if you simply wish to give, and are thus honest as you have no fear to lose, then you inherit in that fact the open and needed elements that attraction and commradery are founded out. "For in your surrender to what you merely need, and not what you unsteadily want, your more willing, and with some evident expectation, to particopate and thus receive: but of the sun on your skin, or taste of something fair and simple, in that your accepting what is there: the account of which is more spread and common in what is normal and around -to which your natural surrender exposes you to."
            <br>&emsp;I am ultimatley confused though, as certain things do excite me, yet, with our built of rules and apprehnsion in mind, so are there things which I'd be pleased to do, but are pinned by doubts and reservation to the means that facilitate the source of their meaning. The key example is publishing, in that I see how we could strictrly write about the novel notion of death; yet, doing so privately, albeit honest and thus present to the world as it is relevant to me, so are we not so open or acquainted with the world as it is in relation to itself. I beleive this is where the worry comes in, as you believe that upon your dissmisal of that, that the world (as its regards are for itself) are passed by, or at least not being contributed to by you. And our wish to have the rewards from benefiting them is what sparks our concern for our place in that realm to begin with; but so in our liberal state, where wants are no longer prominent, I am not sure of my intent in being in that more 'other'd' place; but in that doubt, whereby the lingering of this brings our will into question, so do the bones of those wants feel torn. Their not of concern in any meaty sense, but so is our alteratnive care and effort under its own distress a cause of the alterttive wants to ware and wain. 
            <br>&emsp;For instance, we have struggled for months, nearly a year or so, in distringuihsing between objects as they are fundentally, and how they are ostensibly -to do with configurations of primary, or soul parts. One of the issues, or inquires that this notion is troubled by is space, in that it is hard to remove all things of an ostentious sort into a true form, upon which it is hard to identify space, or an edge even of the absolute. This, as I have learned, is in regards, or relevant we'll say, to a mathematical notion of infintensimals; which, in short, has removed this issues of exact points, and in effect rendered an assortment of metaphysical quanderies mute. This is wonderful, for although I have not assimilated the terms and understanding yet, I effectively have the means to desribe and inquire the whole of everything, in both the domain of all, and its particualr parts. On top of this, it was brought to my attentuion that the idea of self was long ago removed as a neccesity, and that concerning the mind and its supposed viewership, in a contemporay way at least, is admissibale in being souly conerned through a pysholoicagal and physiological lens. And in a word, my wish to understand the brain and its senses is quickly reduced to a need to define the nervous system, vision, speech, hearing, memory, and otherwise the rapidity in which perceived sensation is effectively expereined, 'but is in fact mor akin to the reels of cinema frames'. By that, I believe that the mistaken 'viewrship' of our expereince can be explained, in that, beyond the common senses, that mixed with our faculties, or at least cogs which impress like the rest, that so are they together, in rapidity, expereincing, or at least reacting and bringing us to an astute state, of both the stimule of a direct kind such as heat, and the indirect responses to this, which, for exmaple, comapres to the response to seeing something, in that it conjures a preparation by every input of light, to which the rest of our facultires engage with, as if in attendance and alertness to them. "Whereby the entire nervous system and brain corresponds with all the other parts, bringing our expereince itno one total sensation -and thus the cause of our confusion of a seperate part viewing it all, when that is in fact antoher faculty, or many, corresponding with the impressions which you mistake as otherwise being seperately viewr." 
            <br>&emsp;This is all a long way of saying that of the greatest things wonderment can feel, we are there, and increasingly too. Yet, I mean not to share this, or have it be a mourale which others see; I am in fact, along these lines, more happy with exdpanding our colors and brush abilities, and our subjects at least. If I were to contribute, then  I would write something seperate, as to fit that foot to its shoe. But so is the store far off, expensive, busy, and, admittedly, unclear or familiar by me. It ihas been a long time, an age even, of us reserving ourselves to be as we wish to be persoanlly, but expecting the output of that to procurr what the wants born of our effective lack desired. And this is no more. We have few wants, but true pleasures and comforts we are tuned towards. 
            <br>&emsp;All I have are excuses, as the place of our will to engage with what would otherwise be stated as comfort, is quite far off from ease. The issue is that what is comfortable is more select than it is broad, and that of those things which apply, the time is either not right, or the pursit is one that our current efforts cannot afford. There is indeed a quickening pace in which we are growing, and thus our freedom to pursue other comforts is only becoming more open; and whereas years ahead seemd to be always pleasing, now months seems forever to wait for certain glee. Theres just a great deal of momentum in our industry and creative efforts,  nor have our study and health lost their favored place.
            <br>&emsp;It seems that the more I write the more it feels like were trying to solve a problem, or get around one at least. But I fret a little, perhaps at the reality of our shortcomings and the impact that has on our ability to act with the goods as we currently see in place. By that, there are clear communication problems, be it of relief or remedy from real scrutiny -which in its own right beckons under fear of dissmisal or friction for common (and fairly sought) comforts. Nevertheless, I see, as our wants waiver as their purpose looses its place, that so too in our truly willfull resolve, that to the reasoning and means to faciliate that, in health especially, that there are doubts as to our freedom to do so, and otherwise the means to demonstrate or explain our act of doing so -which, in not doing so, brings murkiness to our own view of what were doing, and thus our wants begin to bear prevalance, but without anything solid or of purpose in their own right, we indulge, or retreat from that, but then into a corner whereby our will to do things we have no open means to do is further tested.

        <div id="properthought">
            Facts regard things, and beliefs remark convicted statements about them, such as, regarding so and so, that they are this way; truth, acts like a scale, assessing whether there are means to verify such statement; in effect, if there is a so and so in fact, and, of fact (to the degree that we can attest to the claim about so and so) that it is so, then of the statement we assent to its truth. Otherwise, if the statement is falsefied on the basis of its fact, then so is it false. Then, regarding knowledge, we have statements that are in fact appropriate to what we seek to know, in that, of the presidents name, it begins with J, but if it was in fact Joe and we believed it john, then we know nothing. Learning then, in that we now know, is about things, and in that what constitutes them; and although we may make statements about said things which are true, so may we learn little, in the sense that, of Donald Trump he is a man, but the truth in  this is quite small in terms of what learning this affords.
            <br>&emsp;Inquiry it seems, is about what we dont know, or at least, regarding scales which we seemingly need, so are concerns subject to this but without the scale at hand, hard to know, as the means to verification are absent: but we may then suppose, on the basis of what we do know; which, as opposed to beliefs, which assent to something being a certain way, so do we inquire, in that we ask about it, so far as we know, and what it may or may not be, or may consider otherwise.
            <br>&emsp;In that, there is little to inquire about the world. Some things may be hard to know, in terms of first hand expereinces which our broader knowledge does not confess; but so can we fill in those holes with direct evidence of the sort, or at least that which establihes a reference of the kind. At any rate, what concerns roots itself in our purpose, and whether or not we should act a certain way. Someones belief may be whole, but small in comparison to the world; while we, know a little of that real world, so are our beliefs in accordance with that; to the effect that we remain in suspence, and proceed to learn. So much as we do, whereby our fidelity to the domain of knowledge (or relevant thought) is accepted, so are we in a state of listening, rather than amends; for we hold no beliefs to carry us, but rather the stance that theres more to know, by which we hold no conclusion to respond to. At any rate, we may have susipicions, and at the very least deny perceived or impressed beliefs that others have, as if only to propose that the amount of information holding those is small (and in some ways fragile). And along this progressive way, our view ahead becomes clearer, but merely on which further shines; and our step remarks the extent of which we still don't know: and beliefs seem to lie in an edge which is reached.
            <br>&emsp;Learning about other's educations seems profitable, as the spread of people's values and character will be more distinct and vast; the news can have its day then, for of those who don't watch, or appear credible enough to not be drawn towards conviction, so is any concern about the amount of those otherwise removed.
            <br>&emsp;It always comes down though as to what we ought to do? For, if children are dying at a significant rate, ought we work to prevent this? And even if every 50 thousandth person is killed in the states, isn't there room for concern? 
            <br>&emsp;The question then regards whether we are equal to the state, and that, like a brother, of a part is mistreated, then so ought we treat it like its our home. Personally, I stand on the leadership across our governing sectors; and, so far as it seems off or misplaced, so is there little which is not aimed at. By this, the party system seems one of priorities, rather than care at all. Perhaps, the economy is what differs most in peoples value of one side or the other; but addressing crime and civil services seems more unviseral. At least, I am hesitant to accept any statement regarding what should be done, or what we shuold be discontent with, when the vector for such actions are unknown; or, at least, if someone does know them, but offers no explanation or basis under that causal sense, then I am not so admitting of the effect they claim. Moreover, this seems to lessen their appeal on platforms that serve as educational, when the offers are beyond principles or basic facts, but convicted statements -which seem to make those who don't know otherwise, as equally stated as those they hear, and this makes those delivering less respectable, as they assume their station as both educator and of the right view.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, we are either informed enough to suspect what is in fact true, and otherwise pass on truly small beliefs. And it does not seem to me that every single person is so inundated with media coverage; at least, so much as any are, it is clear that they are not the major amount; and by that, we can suspect that there are likely more people who have at most appropraite views, if any. I personally though struggle with the statement, 'there will not be a global or civil war, and that robotos won't take over, or that our minds wont be subject to or liberated towards computers'. But I can say, that of what seems concerning, it is not so much that I know and consequently suspect, nor is it so hard to forgo diagnose beliefs, but heed otherwise ours or others regards. "For none know all, nor is a reputable measure for truth in these respects even heard by me." What is worrying then, is akin to religion, whereby people act by a truth they externally hear; and passing what those who are spreading this say, is disconcerning, as the effect of others acting falsely is still up in the air. I think of the thirty years war though, and the relative carnage it produced, but of a seperate sort to the everyday path of living; for the concern was not of conquest, but positions for those who could or sought to worship what they wanted. In that, there may be civil war in the states; and regarding territorial wars, beyond some of the local disputes, there seems to be little notice in western world; nor is a stark opinion regarding Russia or China admittable -but worth learning about. The states is so familiar to us, that understanding its state and federal conduct would go great in terms of reducing governmental concerns regarding conflict; civil dispute may occur, but as if between fans, but not backed or headed by any major officials. Amd at that, spreading out our view as to consider the weakeness of the countries tip, can likely allievate any concerns for it piling over.
        </div>
        <div id="groundsfortruth">
            Truth is a remark of judgements, that upon a statement such as 'so and so is this', that, there are relevant facts that support this, making it true. Beliefs seem to be in line with conviction, or assent at least; but the pejorative of beliefs seems to be where the truth is not known, or at least the statement which you believe is a little rare. That is, if you speak about the world in a way, then a great deal of validation is requied, for the subject is so large. If you assent to this appropriately, then sure, make your general claim. But, as a house on fire is less worrying then an entire town on fire, so are general statements likely to rile conviction, as unless the rareness of it can be addressed, then the front facing value of it may be taken as true. "The world has gone to hell," is an almighty statement, as one could not find the time to judge this accurately; but, less you have the reproach to do so, in that you suspend your judgement as to properly make it, or otherwise pass it off for something worthless to know, so may you accept this as true, and act accordingly -which in effect, responds as if everything is bad, which is indeed an alarming view to contain.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, we tend to care for ourselves, and by that, attend to what is indeed prominent and clear. This leads to awkward views though, as they are not so much of one side compared to another, but void of regard, as if there is no problem. For instance, I have to admitted or direct experience when it comes to Ghosts, and thus there is no involvment with that concner. Those who would judge otherwise, for or against, are admitting the question, and assessing at that: while we are unaware. There is a sensibility mind you which gives a bearing for how everything is, and by that, we fear not to be outside concerns which hold no station in this view. We may not know the breadth or core of that view, but of its merrits we are sure (in terms of our actual expereince and admittence), and otherwise, of that and what we attest, so is there little which can be seen. At least, of the superstitions which may be invovked as our error to be ignorant of, I feel fine in addressing the world as it actually seems: and things of spiritual or lawless sort draw no impression, as the strict offer or supposed chance of what may be so from the appearence of nature, holds no such things as plausible, likley or common.
            <br>&emsp;And so I look at our view, and perhpas can reflect on the source of us seeing as so. And then I look at others views, who I may be cynical as regards their source for seeing so, but more to our benefit would we better describe the rubbish which I mean to be cynical about. Simply, our view is entire, and we are admissiable to that so far as we know, and so much as we don't we retain from judgement, and otherwise reach to extend our means of regard; and at that, so much as we do know, it being sizable, and at that with resemblence of the mighty whole, so do we speak and act accordingly, as if the basis for our words drew from that. On the other hand, is someone whose view is quite near to them, and otherwise summaried in regards to whats foreign; some folk have further bounds for what is foregin, as I am sure pundants have more bounds and complexity to their regards than those common; but it is not unlikely that of the pieces which they have more admission of, that these are not summaried themselves, as nations for instance, or a region at that -whereby China is spoken of as an entity, or Africa too. 
            <br>&emsp;Now, the conduct of those who speak this way is not our concern, for they are just words; and in terms of what is most frightfull, it is the objectives of parliments, senates and executives. But, so much as we are ignorant of the latter, so does the former rub against me. And it is indeed those statements which rest ontop of the substance which they generally remark, and, worst of all, the validation of those statements by other general notions. I stand then with two notions, one of which dismisses statements which we could not effectively judge, at least in the time that the scenario of the statmeent suggests -meaning no casual statements about everything. And at least, our own criticism and regard, as to what facts support even the strictest of claims; for in that, if someone says that Donald Trump is a man, and can use facts to prove this, I still don't care. At least, of that truth there is little I know.
            <br>&emsp;In a word, despite our depth, if we are not definite and in a volumous way, then so will our views seem narrow; for as far as things go, the second theres need for complexity, so does that make there appear an other. By that, our efforts should afford a natural view of the world, but one which is also complex. For it is not the case that between two men that they are commonly set to act in certain ways, but that there are many men, and localles at that. "And I believe that the friction of being so complex, is that it seems to spread out your depth, but in that only lengthen the hollow view."
        </div>
        <div id="meandall">
            What we are asked to do is quite local, welcome, and manageble. There are apparent requests though, along the lines of suspecting a danger and your body corresponding prepares; so too in our idle, or at least self driven ways, do we feel like were not contributing to the world, are being shunned for this. In an earlier time, this same source of outward impressions drew envy and doubt, as if others were doing so well, while we were not doing so much (of possibility at least).
            <br>&emsp;And I can't quite say why this occurs; for indeed, the source is from your seperation, and depending on your view of things, or at least how your impressions are angled, so will you see others who are 'thriving', or those who suffer. "And the feeling that were outside of either, brings with it a sense of pity or shame."
            <br>&emsp;My suspcion though relates to this notion of solidairty, whereby even on your own, when dinner and leisure is enjoyed by your self, your still with others. Its this sense of community, or better yet this breadth of your regard. That just as you stair up and see the sun, or the moutains far off, and as regards the lands or the times which your study and attention bring, so is man all around me, in heartfull extent, and those nearby.
            <br>&emsp;This is where the trouble comes. For in our active solitude, we are but amidst the world, but without her comfort. It is as if you were at the beach, and each and all were amidst their groups and friends: while you sat alone. Are you isolated though, removed, seperate? You can see other's actions, offer and receive support in the worst of times, and in the best of ones as you'd imagine, so would others be drawn to your evident shine. 
            <br>&emsp;Its just the case that were not on the blanket with someone, or playing catch. The children run, and people sit in their chairs, drinking, laughing, sharing their picnic. While I, merely watch the birds fly, or see the sun rising and setting, and the moon coming up for an evening drink. I use the sand as a floor for rest, contentment, industry and joy. And although none stop and say high, so am I fine. 
            <br>&emsp;Where the trouble comes is when this scenario looses its vitality, and our sense of those around causes us to crumble. For starters, vitality is a matter of action and rest; and so if  your vitality is to remain, so must you achieve a ebbs and flows requisite. This we'll say, comes from your understanding, as to have a solid view of things as feel fine in your rest, and have the principles to keep your actions appropriate, and more functionally maintained. To me, this is the landscape, our objective. And of those impressions which bring envy and shame, so are these born from the mishaps of that.
            <br>&emsp;Here, we reach a developmental point. Simply, we have come from a time whereby the core of our selves held no regard; for those who did, acted so with a higher principle in mind; and those who now do so otherwise, hold standards for some farther end, and the means to faciliate that. I am merely settled into the qualitiy of my life, and the excess of our time being spent on so -and our understanding which harmonizes this. In practice, our principles are born to serve that, 'as compared to those who restrain as a poiint of honor or sacrifice, or those who are prudent as to garner them success: our aim is set on the flush of our heart, the swoosh of our hand, and all which governs this marks the spot for our tuning and treatment'.
            <br>&emsp;Its quite simple actually. For so much as you are distinct from others, and as much as this draws either disinterest or conflict, so must you finely amend to do what is neccessary, and be pleased otherwise with your fortune otherwise. It was a point early one that our efforts were not commended, and our rewards accordingly. But, whether this is true, or were expecting something in the first place, so is that fine when we are supplied readily enough to do as we please; and earn the reward from that. "As oppposed to charms and comforting novelty." 
            <br>&emsp;WHen I loot at our issues, it is not so much a sense of defeat or injury; for what we need and seek is already mine, and at that most agreeably in the eyes of those who maintain our interest. But in this, we are more practically limited; for our time in the world is one which pulverizes me. This in on the pure basis of our solitude and our struggle to rest. You see, when were doing, the world is there, fine, and we are around and able. But when we rest, the world feels far, and of all its issues, so do we see them undealt with (and to a destined end), or at least handled by others. "And this makes me feel useless, forgetten, and begrunded -as if they see me doing nothing." 
            <br>&emsp;Two things come to mind. One, is that your rest is very much susceptible to the core need of doing it; and if their are family issues, and a lack of confidence, or if your health is such as to drag to such an spot (where the effect is an idling one), then your slower pace wont be one that has any direction or complicity. Secondly, regards systems, and the network nature of all things which our fear of the world reflects. Simply, there is a galaxy, with main branches, arms, bubbles and stars. These are goverened by varying degrees of folk, and officiated by public servants of all sorts. In fact, those are more like the micro officers, who manage our day to day lives. While those who deal with broader and long term concerns, do so as economists, scientists, researchers and such. This is how medicine improves, or our understanding and consequent amends towards climate change. Nor is each degree of the network absent of folk who mean to properly run it. That isnt to say they are right, well informed, or even neccessarily intentioned. But considering the bones of each area and the positions that holds those who govern them, so are there many who circle around these points, or the levels of the complex at that, in order the operate. 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, our rest is one that must agree with our circumstance; for without such harmony, then the inherent issue reeks of neccssity. While we work, so must we respect this; as all other things of an itinerary sort. And in terms of relatives, so ought you ask for little, earn a practical lot, and otherwise ascent to the minor rules and customs of your plan -within such localle, to be. Beyond this, comes are freedom to be as we please, for whichever end, and by no threat of pillarying circumstance. Self regard is our employment accordingly; at least, as much as our maturity has ordained our efforts and consequrnt means accordingiyl. And then, simply, the process of doing so, bears the load of its nature; and so much as your circumstance or fortune provides, so must you retain fidelity -as not to burrow in and implode upon the required rest. And our view of the world, for clarities sake, can mitigate any inconsistencies there. That is, your view of the world should be so fine, that your only worry is one of your own benefit, as opposed to being foolishly worried about conflict, and otherwise more reasonably, but perhaps limitedly concerned, of suffering.
        </div>
        <div id="unbridled">
            My core, and at heart certain view, is that everything is continuous, comparable, and limited only so much as our descriptive lens can permitt. At that, we are somewhat a physical monist, in that, of the mind -which bars any distinction beyond physicality- is either of the same substance as the rest and therein part of matter; or, if it is indeed something seperate, so is this entity subject to matter. And at that, we are not a pluralist, as if there are many substances. There may be different orients of similar  factors, but not much more than that.
            <br>&emsp;From this, our model of nature is one that is merely variable in the folds and knots of what is otherwise comparable. As it were, there are either several electric fields, or these are but some arrangment of a general field. And by that, due to the evident anisotropies, so do things accumulate, whereby galaxies and their constiuents form. 
            <br>&emsp;Nature is quite seperate from the world, as a family is its own subject beyond the broader place of society. They may mean the same, but for our purposes we can refer to them as something difference. "As if the memebers were of some distinction beyond their associations." From here, we bridge the gap of our mind and salvation, and attribute this to behaviour, unbridled abstraction, and our contrasting reproach onto evident and or speculative matters. "As someone once said, dissolving the problem is not reminiscent of a solution, but a retraction of the issue at hand. In a word, there is a nail, and a hammer would be fitting to hit it down; and either through the confirmation of their being no nail, or a reason to hit it at all, then so are the solutions like a screw with no hole. As it were, as history has gone on, so do such screws repurpose themselves to fit other spots; but as time goes on and their general mold finds even less suitability, so does it wilter away." This is what the notion of God and his conception by men has been brought to, in that, of his portrayal, so are the colors off; nor, of the soucre which enlivened us to identify and attribute him as such, and thereby encourage us to amend, has equally fallen astray. The world we live is one which is free for our grazing time; but only so much as we are like other men, will our ignorance of the end leave us with apprhension of that deeply evdient fact; and at that, expose us to innapropriate alteratives -as if to relief our inactivty to something seemingly pressing.
        </div>
        <div id="grimandshine">
            So the primary fear is one of conflict. This is brought on by the waivering sight of our administration, and whether by being overtaken, or being absent, that civil strife occurs. This more open and public confrontation though, may be either spuradic and local, such as a random mob, or someone's mere participation in a emerging riot' while on the other hand, there may be an organization of itself, whether that be of a criminal sort, rebellious sort, or of a protestive (or activist) kind. I think of the Congo and its loose governement, and how this leaves room for both civil and organized crime. And theres this fear of anarchy as those latter abscesses grow. "A lack of control or authority leaves us with turmoil and fright."
            <br>&emsp;The miliatary is releveant though. For its members are akin to other servicemen (ie. firemen, doctors, technicians etc.); and of these, be it on a municipal, state or federal level, will be employed to either defend the bone's of the administration; and otherwise mitigiate inner public conflict. 
            <br>&emsp;As it stands, our line between our lives and the world is one which wobbles between negativity and positivity. The former is one of disturbance, by way of injury, or is of a more gradding and or sulking toil. In a word, our body seeks whats neccessary; and in that search, or the maintence of a fruitfull source, can treat us with a burdened mind, and heavy feet. While violence isnt something we so accurately predict; or, at least as we can, be it in our dramas or intuited threat, so is the result one of trauma, and in that a halt of living. As it were, the outcome of the injury may be unfortunatne, but so will this leave you with more friction on your toiling path. But of the expereince of pain and suffering, so are these but drowning shades to one who is otherwise squinting at or showered with light. And at any rate, lingering effects from the injury may bring the line of toil to a grueling point. "But this is merely mixing blood with the mud of your otherwise free liviing." As it stands, the world is awkwardly precautious; and this can only be attributed to our natural model, and its esteemed conclusions. But the weakness of this matches the eradict edicts which it inspires. And by that, much severity, and sometimes cruelty, has occured. And at that, there is vileness and putridity -at least from our foreign glance. 
            <br>&emsp;Of the latter though, lies what is otherwise taken away from pain. For even in arduous (as compared to traumatic) suffering, so are we somewhat pleased to be alive. "For those on tough roads, and inclined ones at that, are more than likely to ask the slope to flatten, or for some fortune to give them a boost; as opposed to wishing they werent here." It is true that suicide occurs, as do we get filled with resent and misery. But this are more due to frustration, 'as if your time was worse than you knew it could be'. And in summary, our remark of what is best described as positivity, is one which balances the overwhelming excess of the harshest pains, marbles the true root of our lives with the undenible misfortune (in how we have to be (in our coping) as compared to our ceasing to be), settles the extent of our toil and its relief through freedom, and colors the liberal garden which grows ontop of this open ceiling, to the effect of excess which is not merely of relief (as to soften our toils) or permission (as not to be in toil), but to color our actual freedoms with the gloss and feeling that our unmitigated efforts dream of. Such a land is one in and of itself. For it is still too death, but in line, just, in harmony. And in that, as our sentence to the stake, or that of a boring time, still sees that of sugar or dirt our preference remains, that our liberal aim is merely one which stears our open time, as to do what it would otherwise, with taste and sincerity on the road to its final gain. "And which Jew, perhaps, on the steps of Auschwitz, failed to see the bright blue sky? Doth our ends change those who reach them? And by that, ought we simply be clear as to what is not becoming, required, or of worth, on such route? For we see it, meet it, in any position or kind? And our poetry is perhaps a realization as to why we curry ourselves otherwise, and mistakenly amend? And that perhaps, in our own relfection, lies the slight change which brought our active time, to be more commensurate with the true ups and downs of our given life: and that in doing so, what was sought was not more, but an agreement with such end: for as the goods of our real-time grew, so did its resmblence to truth in our end grow clear, to which, we felt more encouraged to see it as so, and do what left us with an accord to be in such agreement"

            I have an idea, and one of grave importance. Simly, the core of a theory is that it tries to stand our observations up tall; and does so by trying to be deep enough, and in a way that respects the extent of our observations. Philosophy remarks the realm outside this erected grounds; and in these depths one may hold their entire view; or they may otherwise suppose, and in an ontological sense sculpt the needed cogs for the basis of our more apparent impressions. But in this, there lies a very nestled train of thought regarding epistimolgoy. Propigated by Berkely and Hume, and on one end reinforeced by Hegel and Kant, lies a proposed limit of knowledge, by virtue of our mere correspondance with things -and those latter gents and their conseuent schools, solidifed their view on the ultimate basis of such subjectivism. For me though, the problem lies in the nature of our senses. For, in ones assumption that an arbitrainess is essential for motion, and by that, of such instigator and our comparability to it, lies the mind, that so has matter remained so seperate, and subject to a mechanisn which is at its core goverened by the almighty and our perceiving minds. Physics and the rest of science has sought to refine the defintions of these particulars, and by that alter the supposed metaphysical need. But although the pragmatic view of our mind has been established, with much applied growth from this, there still lies this all to considered vitalism of our mind. And in that I mean to refute.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, our mind is a mere aggregate, as is our sense of touch. For the latter is in fact a complex of indiviudal strings, which akin to our body being united, but of pieces, so are the many fibres and strands of our nerves, muscle and bone intertwined as to create the experience of our touch sensation. Yet, there is this all too pervasive distinction of something seperate being privy to such impression. Of this insight, I say, in a common view, that a grip of your mind and matter is absent; and that just as one of a mature kind is not in awe of anything -overhwlemed or put off that is- so is a ready treatment of reflection and active virtue effective as such as not to leave someone in wonder or doubt regarding their mind: and at that, without any apparent interest or evidence to cause such a distinction. More importantly though is in regards to our actual senses. And in explaining those, the otherwise ambiguity of them will not leave so much room to introduce an observer. "As if our sense wasn't already enough." Simply, light is a wave, and a stream within a general field. An atom is similar, in that its parts are but instances of such field, and with binding portions of that field which hold it tgoether -the strong force. What I believe is lost is how our vision is with respect to tissue. For, of this supposed observer, if our eyes were out, then there'd be no visual data for us (ie. the self) to observe. Yet, the actual sensation comes from our brain responding to the inputs of light. As it were, the general field holds arrangments, and light is a mere property of that, whereby its ripples in some way cause its substance and binding, while light is a mere accompanying ripple of those components; and we, as our own bind of ripples, is struck by such waves, and rippled ourselves. This process is the aggregate expereince; and be there a mind or not, that of a ball which falls by God's hand, so is this motion of the general field the ball. And at that, I would describe the issue's of philosophy in that, of two gas bits in a box, that their interaction is a mere natural exchange, except of the constraints and 'supposed' effect of the box. Yet, of our inquiry, as science has increasingly achieved, so is it only fair to presume the bounds of such box as it relates to the existing nature of the gas which it is the basis (or contraint) for. And in my own theory at least, the bits of gas are one, in the way that a ripple of fabric here and there is not a division of such fabric but arrangment of it; and that of the basis for such substance, that it is becoming of one's faith in science or reason, to suppose that such basis is in fact inherint within the fabric. And, at least, that our source of such fabric remain in doubt as long as our identity of that fabric is incomplete; and that we retain respect for the ontological need for such substance, on the grounds that anything contrived is so, that the basis which it faciliates is for that substance. "And one must be quite content, in their certainty, to know only that a floor is required; but thereby speak nothing of its on depths, or any relation to its creation -for you at most know that there was creation, but not how, or of what."

            I cannot end war. As it happens, there are folk who inhabit general roles, and based on their volition, animate such roles as to be cohersive, disruptive or confrontational. The nature of our concerns is heavily towards the former, in that of others actions, so may our own abbrahsively reply. For no one wants fighting; but we can also remain mature as we decide what this means. For there is continuity, time, humanity and reason towards the battle zone, the time between, and those who linger around. Theres simply not much I can do. And, as it were, the past incurions have been one where most folk where in not position different than I: that being adjacnet, observed, and at worst mishandled during the strides of those more literally on route to war. These folk are more or less the heroes; though I feel it is of a massive world trying to cooperate, and otherwise surive, whereby fighting between them occurs. Their objective is unclear; nor is any understanding of this built on much more than short statements. It is just quite hard to say. But so much as the defeat of others is each memebrs goal, so is the reason for such hope a long one; and by that, we can attest to the motions which bring together such parties into conflict, and how such forces have drained from our nearly modern world. Within my ignorance, I say that to those involved, that our symptahties go to the continuious stream of combatants; and otherwise sideliners and foreginers who are not at all invovled; and that of our coming time that such a reality will remain; but too, of an end which also perhaps remains more solid and united, by the vectors of that core continuity.

            Reproach remarks a stance of reservation, whereby a bad opionion isnt put in place for none at all. In that, our views are suspended on the back of our understanding that most matters have much more to them then I am privy too -or with a grasp of. I don't then shun the concerns, as the abscence here is only because I know little; but I also dont heed or voice sentiments beyond this: for I know theres so much which I do not know.
            <br>&emsp;The trouble though is that being without a view is quite hard when others are not so reproached. And indeed this is frustrating, for their opinions feel so small yet vehement. And at heart theres nearly no principle fidelity in our broad views, nor any when it comes to judging small matters amidst the whole.
            <br>&emsp;Internationally the law is tough, for what holds the U.N together is beyond me; nor is the more common act of trade blocking and tariffs a less acceptble form of my ignorance. But locally, as regards our domestic matters, I am of the view that those who run the many positions are but animators of the (more or less) constant positions. And simplifying this to who holds the majority sway in parliment feels off; as their are surely other elements of government, be it diplomats, ministers, and the more state wide and or municipal sectors. And at any rate, those who form and maintain the bulk of our policies still have their own internal conduct. And as a form of mature consideration, I'd say that each memebrs differences amidst one another leans on their contrasting views and principles, not character. Anecdotes and instances of true beaurocracy and meddling are not in themselves symptoms of some underlying rot. Perhaps there is a difference in the groove which one sees when it comes to goverment, in that one sees it as a means to serve, or a means to inact change; but for personal gain (and any according negligence or larseny) seems quite less so. At least under a fair, if not reserved lens.
            <br>&emsp;In describing government, we must settle into the relations it has with its subjects; but less the authority is one of a despotic sort, then it feels fair to mark these relations as integrated; as almost definitively, those who are elected are done so by the public, and accordingly they too are the sample which such electees are taken from. 
            <br>&emsp;My perception is simply to do with the disstate of public officials by those who become aware of misconduct, mistakes, ill-wisdom, contrariety and so forth. The issue with this, is that although each dispute is fair, that the details of each one does not (with much strenght at least) cross over to other matters. Trust and general judgement are surely permissable, as the suggestion of one error brings up concerns for an other. But so much as other actions and decisions are concerned, so are the matters of that excluded from the woes of other errors: while these other ones are subject to their own details.
            <br>&emsp;This is all to say that there is this wobbling trust between common folk and the administration. For one, the difference between city, state and federal levels of authority seem misunderstood; nor the general whole and its real ways and principles. And ontop of that, this view that people have is faciliated by a increasing number of sources, to which their view of things near and far is saturated and defined. The quality of such discernment is one thing, but it is clear that most folk have some full view of things; and that much of that contains the misteps of their authoritites. The pure weakness of this is in regards to the function of government, and how much really goes on beyond these peculiar mishaps; and at that, the assessment of the issue is not so easily weighed in terms of how severe it is, and thus of its actual judgement of what it means. So it is odd for me to sit here in reproach, and see people either disgusted or upset with certain figures and their actions, and the system overall. Its quite ignorant, absent of reproach, and almost surely reactive.
            <br>&emsp;Yet, why is this upsetting? Is it because we cannot say otherwise; and its like someone asking trite questions about the universe, and pinning my otherwise grand speculation? Its surely not suitable or fair conduct, despite its absolute point. Yet the proper course, which the question surrounding this would also align, is in regards to our search and discovery -for we are coming from points which are prior to what has yet become known [voiding the merrit of absolute concepts].
            <br>&emsp;In that, you indeed have the overall complex of the state and its content; which is to say its array of members running the various positions, and the general and or specific remarks about the functioning of the land in which their role is part of. And indeed the relations and connection to other such polities is key as well. For, if Canada were all alone and unsubject or with care to other nations like it, then the matter of organization would be simply kept on the basis of what we all hope for; and conversation and rights would be a unifying force and cleansing factor as to retain our shared agreements and administration. Oddly, this seems to be how the world functions right now. And indeed, the modernity of our current time is one which uniquely distinguishes itself from the eons leading into the great wars. And perhaps our understanding is that, in terms of brevity, that such a world and its conflicts were in fact more drawn out and continuous, and in that more humane and digestible; and although the intersections were of a combating sort, so were they met with the more fair and agreeable continuity which led them their, through, and beyond their ends: to which we are the evened out offspring. In that, I see that very little has changed, and that only due to a crushing of lasting principles, was continental conflict erroded; and at that, the shared, or parallel at least, aims and actions between each nation and the goals which they sought for their citizens -which, to a confrontational exhausted point, is not through such conflict. And so perhaps our study need be in the times before, and those of now; whereby our mature lens be spent on the extant of antiquity through the recent world, to the more contemporay stretch of liberty and its struggle to retain it.

            I am afraid to embrace the proper life, as the imperfections of it leave me vulnerable to the extensive reality which our strenght would otherwise wrap around. I say, boldly, that the rigid edge which this fear is apprehensive about, has been more or less dealt with, as not to be so petrifying -in our anticipation at least. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, we are in agreement with life, as to proceed as we truly are, and as we please at that. For upon this road, whereby we are solid and sincere, so are our paces elevated by their inner strenght: to which we dance and shine.
            <br>&emsp;Such an active lane, is one that is guarded and or marshalled by the ministry of men; and I, a soul member, am responsible to oblige this, earn my share, and mend my ignorance and neglect as not succumb to our ultiamte regards; whereby the future we know, and deliberately deem evident, makes our time elsehwere regard those who limit such whims as petulant, small, unstable, and in that recripricative to other's more common, but similarly foolish. This is a horrorified image which comes from our slouching mind. And by that, our agreement, to take nature's hand, dance fully, and by virtue of that, accept, respect and amend, to the existence her floor, and our according end.
            <br>&emsp;Practically, I am no longer afraid to be myself; for in that, the press from within holds no grimace or fear upon settling, and improperly at that. At any rate, our imperfections are but fair occurences, and concerns which are merely subject to my aversion to them, as opposed to what others wish for me to be. Our communication on that front has removed their contempt; nor do I reach for anything, as to hesitate at our own lackings, and the perceived reservation from others. 
            <br>&emsp;I am simply going to be. And my purpose is not either shrowded or exempt from the cultural ministry: by that, we are unafraid to be take a small part, and grow as we continue to felicitously be. And simply, our fear of not being the one in charge otherwise, is held at bay by the agreeable and or grateful sense, of the many who are in charge, their success, the crumbs of their shortcomings; nor, the need to eat other's food, or the awkward belief that other's think its great. At least, how the whole of folk engage is less general than any rightly propose; and in turn of our impression, and especially through the shield of those slouching around, so do they say little, or counteract our broad and vital view. At most, we can see the interaction of their affairs as comparable to scrolling and pornography, in that the effect is not one of altering our disposition, nor the fear of others being so (and their response at that), but our own begruding and exhausting input of such grimey, cavalier and saturated products. Other people are loosing in these ways as they are with poor eating: but this is not a distinct remark between those who are less and those who are more. At least, overall complex and its finer structures hold what is in fact actionable and determining for those opinionitive, idealistic or foolish. "And such shouting and whims make very little change of the bones of such a setup." At best, there is more prominence in terms of who mans such points: but so are such points, when tied all together, a nearly motionless brace which fully provides. "And it seems that the reality of civil unrest, media fighting and regards, and fear of the future at that, has to due with the color of those immortal principles." At least, changing those even an inch would take the force of our sun.

        <div id="pitchedremarks">
            Regarding the truth, which we beckon to, but also question, so are we subject to it along the lines of continuous self regard, and that of freedom to be otherwise, but undefined.
            <br>&emsp;On one end, our life is really at most a suspension of impulse, whereby we parlay with more primary forces as opposed to superficial ones; and at that, tango with more delicate and pure forces for a more ripe and fruitfull end. This is to do with dear qualitites, as opposed to short lived expereinces. Besides this, lies the mystery. For I am indeed set and free, and by that, holy stated as to be as we see fit: and at that, act as I am pleased liberally. Only, the remark of this holds a dissolute sway. For the insight of the former point, is that our interests are not in need of clarirty, nor intention; for, as a parched man sees and drinks water so much as he is able, that so is our freedom to do as we please in correspondance with removing the friction to what we'd otherwise do. In other words, we do as we are able, in motion, pleasure, taste; and as our concerns and or duties become either less severe, or maintained, then so does our attention drift elsewhere. Normally, we regard this as positive problem solving, whereby our curisoity holds a need of relief, or closure, as we are drawn to things which remark our less burdened senses. But in either case, none ask and care to define their need for food, but innately heed the growling reponse; and at that, once being fed, so are more delicate faculities free to express their need. But we ask then, upon such liberty, or remission of our attnedance to surivival, as to how we should be? At least, it seems that we see something we like, and of a liberal kind; and my reservation in proclaiming that such an interest will be our aim is in the fact that, of that which limits us from pursuing as we'd see fit (and were pleased and drawn to), that such impingments were in fact still present, and the kind of things needing our regard. This is a nice mechanism, and indeed is one that allows our problems to be solved; and to the effect that our experience is one that is more dear and pleasant upon reflection. "which we might summize as, having put our forcefull efforts into clearing the road, that I am happy to have gone where my perpetual motions take me, as they were otherwise hitting rocks, or a wall." 
            <br>&emsp;A mechanism though is not exactly what I see. And indeed in this state we come to our sprouting interest; and, of such sort, a less than recent development. At that, I see this nature of our desire, and how we are in fact -as comparable to our problem solving efforts- afraid, and reserved at that, or dreaming otherwise. This is where the motion to exclaim your liberal interest comes in. For it is easy to decy the pursuit of something densely pleasurable; while those things of innate good which you pursue hold neither the flavor of that, nor the fortunae inducing end of ambitious efforts. And, perhaps, as we are still with the friction of life, and our personal regard, so is the plea to proclaim a liberal interest on which does so as if to overcome that burdened sense; which, practically, may come as a sort of promise or conviction, when you are in fact not vital enough to naturally partake in such efforts; they draw you, but your hand is ungenerous; and so you instill the future of it, as if to overcome the impression of toil, which colors your stillness. In all of this though, we are merely earning permission; as if, upon a basic shift we earn cash, and a moment of time to relax; that so to, in our truest ways, when the whole of our life spares a moment, we can read, study, sit and see, and by the objects of that, acquaint ourselves with their prescence, and instill them as future goods  neccessairly born of our continuing success. But we are merely sharpening our newly modern tools, as to be more privy, in tune and aware, as to feel permitted to see such things within our liberal state, how to hold them, treat them, earn their favor and hand. But this is a tale as old as time; for our current era is merely a poinnt of the advance, whereby the roots of our fortune are solidified, and the non-brutish elements which we are then aware of are responded to. Its all living though, regardless of our fortunate end to the scale. 
            <br>&emsp;What I cannot explain, as it is not something I create, is the spark of a question, regarding true desire, fear, contenment, and of mine, and its brief way in which the nature of our freedoms afford me. For I was reading a book about materialism; and the prose was so sharp, personal and rich -by lange. In that, this problem I've had for a while regarding the constiuency of things was brought to submission, as this return of the book brought much comfort in how we'd propell our understanding; and at any rate, our cheer and submission to that, merely remarked the good which reading the book brought, and I presumed it would bring. Upon finishing it for a moment, having stepped outside, I considered the strucutre of this desire, and how open we were to heed it and see it moving ahead. And perhaps my point is risen, that of this remark, so is it of a pure good, at least something which was holly original and sought by ourselves. Of this though, lies the purpose of our reflection. As, the nature of these regards was in line with our pure desire, or draw at that. And as it were, a sliver of doubt, concern, or, as it happens, an equally small reassurance, as if to testify the suitability to be so purely drawn, came about; and from that, a sort of momementum, whereby of that reasurrance, we could not say so deeply in a succinct way; and that even if we could be full and convincing, so were there many words invovled with this; and from there, came an even large doubt, at least so much was relatively small when compared to that reassureace, but large compared to the sliver which sided our pure intent. And by that a snowball effect occured, to the point where the initial interest was obscure, and the shuffling of our reassurance came to be. In that, we could see, as if a formula which was brought into existence, and of a large quanity, that there were holes, or at least smaller points and ends which needed definement.
            <br>&emsp;A mechanism indeed. "For I am in fact not free to be, purely; but so, in reaching so, where the impulse is there, and confidently, that the prescence of the smallest doubt reveals which, upon aggregate, is in fact lacking. And maybe, upon tying up those ends which are important, that we can remain confident, and steadfast to our supposed end. Which, mechanically, may simply leave us with things we don't know, but are not in fact usefull: or, of importance, as our actuall reservations source from."

            So I am a man without trouble, but a man still indeed. For I have responsibilities to maintain; and, even during my troubles, which lingered infront of our completed duties, so could we see in that finsihed state a time of cheer and plenty. Now, those troubles are removed, and we are left with an increasing stablity and that wholesome sight. At that, the duty we have is not only to what basically provides, but to that generous hand which those colorful lights which ask me to  offer. There is trouble in this though, for the world of this is on its own, hard to communicate, and dragging against our otherwise checked emotions. If we were more strictly occupied, then our stability would be great; but as it were, we are more or less free and content, but fully, and at that subject to further scents. Only, in that broad way, so does the bound of our world view begin to crumble, and all the vague and misty sentiments about it come pilling in. Its akin to space travel, whereby one gets warped, and in that overly twisted until they arrive at their place; akin to Harry Potter and apiration, whereby there dragged hither and thither, till settling in a new and normal point. That is what the far off view of things deals  me. On one hand, art is the response, for in our idleness, or opened way, so do we wish to clarify and describe those swooshing feelings, as to give them more body. But then there is the core trouble of being a man, in that, of our stability and openess, that it is brought by frugality and modernity. And so we are in fact overlly full as it is, however plain. In this though, there is this sense of self, which is all too passionate as to leave its slower state, or is to crumbling, in that of its milder ways, so do its surroundings crucify it. This indeed is perhpas a remark of our solitary ways, for withtou that, we are more focused and in check. Only, the truth rears its head, in that of our regards, concerns and care, so are they on a continous track, and at that one which does not see us in or reaching a halted state. In such a state you'd be more like gas in a sealed bag; which however speckled in its volume, still increases in pressure until the seal gives. At that, I consider our warmth in friendship as a more genuine and promising platform to see and proceed; while in our solitary state, there is less to comprhend. Passion either arrives, as we dream of further things ahead which can draw our attention; or we are dealt with what I can only regard as maturing, in that we lightly hold our slowing pace, and yeild not to the familila and or vague forces which swarm in on me. At that, the latter gets ironed out, as the landscape becomes more flat and defined, and at that, holds its low clarity (and point of projectio) from further away. And, as perhaps remarks our understanding of whats around and who we are as one subject to it, so in that blossoms a source of communication and interest, as we are more free, clear and undischeveld, and at that more attached to things prior to our passionate glance; and here, there is more to say to those nearby, giving us the liberty to proceed (and as such), and otherwise see what is in fact relativley far, but from this finer paces. "Which is to say, that in our unerving state, the groundfloor and position is more extended as compared to our current one which is composed; and at that, the far bounds of our time reach past that stretched state, while our solid and hearty place holds its far regards in an absolutely nearer place. From a 10 mile vantage point one can see 100 miles, whereas, one whos station is on a mile flat, sees vistas 5 miles out. And our goal as a man is in the unerring and winding desires of what makes us in agreement with that."

        <div id="flathome">
            So I maybe see it, maybe. In our slowed ways, theres this need to see something, or define our place and path ahead. Yet, our actual sight is one which is gripped differently, in that it merely describes our real view. Simply, there is this land ahead, and at that lies afoot our starting point. Only, in our resting depths, what acts as common part of the beginning is in fact our actual end. For were all trying to get somewhere, and at that, our posture is reflected. Ours is so dealt with and secure, that what is far ahead is in fact prior to people's starting grounds. Its as if there home is the world, but this sense is quite loose and chaotic; and at that, their far regards are in the solar system but not much further, as if the flakiness of the lens causes their surroundings to be hazy and limited. Ours on the other hand, sees a compact and definite view of my pure self, and at that our municipal area feels like a country. At that, it is much easier to grasp what is otherwise relatively small for people. Commonly, our country is what seems local, and the other side of the world seems far. For me, our domestic zone is a world entirely; and becuase our modern gaze has access to see this more clearly, so does my reaching regard magnify further with solidity. Instead of being on the earth's edge, and loosley, we reach its edge from a definite source, and at that continue the beam of impression out into the galaxy. 
            <br>&emsp;And what I know is that in this definitely vast view, that all in the world is flat. There is no humps and edges, but slow, even paces, and points at that. All that you see, or have heard, is a fantasy, in that it is not exactly so; and, for your benefit, ought be considered flatly itself, or as something irrelevant to the real source. And what I personally see, is that in flat expanse, that our relevant regard is sooner reached than our hearts content could fail to meet. Everyone is so far outside themselves, that their future end lies in the haze of the void around us. While for me, who's concrete moment is closer by and at hand, that of the extent which is deemed common, so is the edge of that (where other's generally begin) lies my furthest regard. And because of this, my dreams and passions, albeit lingering remnants of my solifiying way, have no more hold on me: for their possibility is past evident. "One small solid step can reach across the bounds of time; while a loose and pulled apart pace, can only reach so far -even if its starting point is further out. Its like a dense cloud of hydrogen, which under the pressure shoots out light; compared to a loosely put together clump, who's diamter extends further, but has less strictness to magnify so far."
            <br>&emsp;As it were, this road to the end, at least as much as our end is worth knowing, that I can see how free we are upon its approach. And at that, so can our path in meeting so, be well and kind, bright and fine. Theres no reason or need to look yonder, as the point of its relevance is already seen within the bounds of what we already know. We need to reach for something further, for our experience will not catch up. And so, in terms of our passion, let this truth breed consistency, and at that remove the sores and or complacence which breeds such yearning; and as regards communication and inquiry, simply see the fruits of truth for yourself, and at that be more set and fair in what you feel fine saying; and at that, more able to love, and thus see what you do from this levelled lens; and at that, explore both what is relevant, and acceptable to this real mold. This remarks this unruly fact, that our fleeing views of what is otherwise humane or unfortunately common, is in our unyeilding to the truth; and as if our passion is the vector for what stretches us further away from it (whereby we'd settle), then so do our obscure views get equally stretched: the effect being one natural things seeming malicious, when in fact there tearing makes them appear so maligned. And at that, as this fear builds up, as if a imbedded thorn in our passionalty imbedded mind, so are we left with the debris of poor imagery to burst through, whereupon our acceptence to the real facts must be elevated from their hidden position. The truth though, brings its false horror down: to a point where there is not but the close effect of vice and villainy: but not in the far extents of severity where true misfortune lies.

        <div id="ebbofourway">
            I'm just a pleasant wreck. Not a single problem in the world. Yet, the effect which rubs against me still remains one, despite our overall mending of it. That is simply the idle sways of receding passions, and the awkward mix of postive contentment, and the remnants of poorly defined views which linger from the wilderlands of our passion.
            <br>&emsp;These insights give credence to holes in our knowledge, or things at least which remark our own personal liberty. For, there are many elements to life which I surely was unprivy too, in our wandering whims, and at that am without despair as we settle in. But of those contents which have been impressed upon me, amd loosely in our impassioned forays, so do our insights reveal where these are ill-defined, and throbbing. it is true that our occupation removes the sight of these, and at that yeilds me room to worry about our own troubles. But as we do, and our  passion looses its way, so do those loose threads buckle in. Again, we fail to notice this when we are settled, or in motion that is. And one may offer the clear insight into our developments, and their abscence of pure occupation; whereby we have less to do in  our rest, less we ware ourselves thin. And at that, we may reck ourselves as to remove our regards at all; as if to dull our mind, as not to be so vital in its resting ways. 
            <br>&emsp;For that is the true and genuine point, that in our normal paces, so does the ebb and flow retain a constance progress. And in this, it is those loose threads which pull at me while our steps are slower, our passions which give our mind some reprieve by seeining a more impenatrable pace, or our disregard, which gives us room to do nothing pleasantly, but with a roughness to our eventual steps.
            <br>&emsp;Grounding this is the ointment to our developmental tears; and alongside that is the resolve which remarks an agreement with the fairest truth. That, is simply that we see our unerring end, and it is in our settled grasp. And in that, we act as would reflect such a scenario. In a word, what is to be gained outside of that bears no concern, and so much as we are asked to or able, so do we along that path proceed. And it is within this that our idle state looses all its clamor. As indeed we are set on a true and forward motion, and indebtedly so, for it bears remarks and prudence to true root and end. Its as if we are not afraid to do as we seek, or am bound to in an according way as remarks our liberated place. Such liberty though is down the path of reason, for our dismissal from peril and fights is not such as to encourage or permitt gluttony and foolishness; for, whichever reason, I know our end is so, and at that have no recourse to ignore it. And as it were, as if a local woft of air which gives an aggregate rise to this mortal fabric, is our common expereince of lethargy and busyness. That latter perhaps remarks the source of our turn from tradition; and at that transition, so are we without much care or strenght to build momentum in the opposite direction; for within that, where pleasure and success hold the vector, so is the busyness of it all a clear vice to it all, and unideal at that.
            <br>&emsp;At that all I have is our ideal; and so little as it is not, we are complete. We are dying, and this fact does not constitue the comparison of others; as this shared notion is one that merely relays an obviousness between eachother, but through seperate entities. This is not too important though. For I know I will die, and at that am moved little beyond what marks our path towards that. I can committ to an understanding of how things are; but truly, there is no clear sanctity of who I am purely, whereupon our wish to be alive curries our savor for wherever there is action. Which is all too say that beyond ourself, as if beyond our internal condition, there sits very little sight or concept of things besides there appropraition to ourselves. Like an oasis, or river, which appears as an object which relates to our thirst, and parched state at that. And as it were, being in such a state promulgates the view of things, as if there all being judged as so, in being fit or not. 
            <br>&emsp;And by that, I must say that of our development, it is but a swirling state, whereupon the openings of our strides we accumulate some external sense, and take that back in to our innermost selves (when our paces relax). From this I have ideas, but one's which are not fully integrated, and at that aligned. These words would feel more assuring if they were in fact probelm solving; but the fact that our problems are but symtpoms of our solidifying state, is such as to curry an interest in removing the problems, or solidify. And I only know that of that latter, that it is done by the steps and cares which remark our collected self, of which we are privy to not but what remarks our end. While those elements which seemed to call me, in both fear and glory, or contrition, feel like goals and threats which have no identity or claim, outside their intermiedary exposure within the lively moments of our day. Yet their fleeing in that sense, for we are never there enough to know them; as upon a routine, we simply hold more breadth and clarity in the subjects we have; yet, many still swirl around, as if unimmedaite elements to our uncovering forray. Perhaps we look to much; as indeed, this ebb and flow of our day, is such as to be not so calm at is root, nor to ample and ill-soft in its peak. For that I say that we are not so privy to things as they seem in our fullest state. But moreover, what there even is to see when we are in such  place; and how we act as such prior, or without, any prior impressions. For what is the world truly, when we are local civilly and true to our death? Is there a world around, a host of folk: how could there be in fact things so general? It is more or less the times. But so are we in a different space when it comes to evening out our days. And who we are in such governance is not so clear. And really, it is the harshnes, imagery and fear, in going about what we find dearly quaint and sincere, while we ignore those elements which our developing state explored, and the prevalence of those claims.

            My path is such that in terms of its station, were fine; and otherwise, with respect to me, so are we comparable. 
            <br>&emsp;For the former, we are tasked with itinerary or communication. Practically, that which is given is done so through an understanding; and as it were, our time at home is of the type, and specifically demanding of our communication; for in that, me and my folks are on the same page, and theres no perceived or recieved apprehension. Secondly, regards our committments, which simply have us providing for ourselves in a itinerary fashion. On one hand, we have the common invovlenents of this in part time/local work; and then there are those flexible positions which give leave for transitions. Though, this aspect requires its own itinerary of development. 
            <br>&emsp;As for myself, I am still more or less subject to the world and her ways; and by that, am open and free to be positively, so much as our condition is met. In growing older you learn to accept that there are things which need to be done; as although the efforts to remove your condition are not so favorable compared to those efforts which your stability brings, so is there basic things for that latter to be supported properly. And by that, I have learned that of those simple tidings, be it hygene, homely attire and chores, or the meager attendance of a shift, so are we equally able and privy too similar tasks which could be fruitfull. In this sense, we are not saying to step beyond yourself as to achieve things in an according way; but as you clean your room and show up for work  to provide for your shining life, so can you make equally simple amends in the realm of friendship, relations and oppertunity. On that account, as you would communicate for harmonies sake with your mom and dad, be as clear and open about your interests in gaming, and by this count or another, you may find an according friend. Relations are tough, but so are fine already, and at that prime to give and recieve. And by that, our efforts can be at least fortifying, in that we are openly proceeding with the aim and care to acheive; and that is in the simple realm of online dating, whereby you make an honest and sincere profile, and try at least to be present enough to bolster a claim. More than that, your strict efforts will give you more breathing room, as to relax and settle amidst your otherwise oppertune peers; who in our steadyness of resolve, can be who they are as peers, and not so begrudgenly or nievly judged as relational prospects. Our working in the community is similar. Be it through church, a meetup, or some further event and invovlment, so will that give a breadth which allows you to be yourself personally, and pleasantly amongst folks around. In an equal way as dating, so will your satiety from yourself and its lengthening treatment from more outward discourse, settle your time amidst your neighbours and peers, as to be not oppertune, nor stilitfying at our otherwise stiff and obscure ways. This is indeed a great circle. Accordingly, our professional aims and interests are such, that of this basic and blooming layer, so are there deliberately outer regards which are recipient to our personal touch. This may mean a development towards an occupational skill or trade, or may be more generous, with an aim of ideals or counsel. Aside this, is our writing's regards, whereby our homely and austere craft, steadily opens itself to potential publishers or agents. By that, as we are speaking of ourselves, I wish to conjure, cherrish, and leave (by our legacy/token of promulgation) a ledgerous work of nature's basis, structure and forthcoming development. With perhaps some sugar and cream of our own idealic commisery sprinkled between that latter end.

        <div id="rootofourroute">
            Thinking back, our initial adolescence was in regards for nutrition and the crucial nature of it. I did have Justin as a friend, but generally we were on our own. Perhaps his prescnence in this core task excited this, but I recall various insights which we were excited to share. Now I am wondering why? One aspect is the unending and imperfect condition which nutrition was a shield against; which is to say that our accounts (so to speak), upon our nutritional revelation, seemed to be leaking, the plug of which nutrition became. Only -though much time has gone on to make this evident- that such a hole never got filled, and at best, we did our best to mend it; but not to any perfect, or at least constaly as such degree. And foremost, despite our developing proficiencies in such matters, so could our attendance to them never cease. Even if we had the lever which could effortlessly lift the world, so is there no room to release the handle. Historically, our leverage is high, but our employment of the craft is off, in constancy at least. Nor is it immortalized as something of concern; for none of our extenuating matters (regarding family and friends) pay any attention to it; at least no one close cares much at all; and of those who do, they are far, and in many ways trivial and bare in their attempts. 
            <br>&emsp;My point, is that like death, so was the need for nutrition and its regards an evident deed; and that because it was not so clearly solved, or able to be ignored upon properly handling it, so did we seek others interests, as if to fortify our amends and propiety. 
            <br>&emsp;I look back at our younger years and there was indeed this dismissal (and fight) about being occupied, or investing ourselves rather. I was already pleased, and without sincere cares for the issues being smouldered over me. Critically though, we were friends with Colin, Justin, Seb even. And although marijuana and (as it would seem) poor habits and eating were common, so were we generally pleased; and in a word, outside this called for committments, happy. Which is not something I can say now. 
            <br>&emsp;As PLutarch says, growing up is not about abandoning rules, as if into a open land free from your teachers and parents. No, such a land is hallowed by reason, to which our wills ought oblige. This is the difference you see. For in our later youth we were happy; but only so much as our freedom from common investment had something we were pleased to do. As that dried up, by account of our friends taking on their own tasks, so were we left with our selves to play. This was not so enjoyable; and at any rate, bellowed under poor choices and an abscence from the world. I still maintain that if someone had said that me, Colin and Justin could smoke and be friends, that not a internship at NASA could draw me. Alas, we were asked, and a combination of others going their own way, and our remaining time being spent in ways contrary to them, our core selves, and that of our family around, made for a freedom which was not either stable or gratifying. 
            <br>&emsp;I found reason though, with nutrition being the beginning path. In that though, I perhaps experienced what all happen upon, in common or less so ends. Simply, a route of duty is one akin to Atlas', whereby the task at hand is not subject a momentary load, and then followed by an abscence of it, but rather a committment to hold such a weight, and continually. As it happens, one may find different positions, or points of leverage rather, to address that condition. In this respect, my life was such that the basis for the condition was purely fundemental, whereby my own regards and that of matters which were external so much as we extended ourselves (namely studies), which compared to a more common basis, who's concerns were set on amends which would gratify traditional concerns. Which, evidently, seems fair, as such heralded values are such as have come from the aggegrate paces of the past. Yet as a dolphin recieeves the most toxins from a spill, as a little bit in each plankton gets overly consumed as the big fish eat so much of the latter, that of the ill-wisdom and contrariety rung through the past, that so of the might in which tradition stands, such stains are present. 
            <br>&emsp;By that there have been many things which I found unbecoming when not taking them for granted. Namely, the point of a child, and its irrelevance to the population of the world, nor my need to give it anything more than I would need in our development and adulthood. By that, the aim of the former is to faciliatte the latter; and in the pecuniary sense, so is there the limited need to that which nourishes and houses the movments which nature otherwise takes care of. If the child can write, speak, run and read, then he can go anywhere in the world, and prioritize anything he seeks. There's no matter that isn't of such communicatve or generous craft. And the housing required for this is simple. As for me, our route is such that raising the child is a matter of permission; for our required amends to nature, ie. our encumbant maturity upon our actual success, bears both an according regard of how we will properly act in such rearing, and towards which we suitably proceed. This last point addresses one's current address, for they have either received training and are realizing themselves; or they have done so, and are ready to offer something which someone is the luckiest to recieve.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, our muffledness in reaching this otherwise traditional state is such, that of its contrast to the  latter's complexion, that of the central goal (in kids), that so are we without haste or reason to reach. For the basis for this is that all we are asked to do, is be ourselves, and then upon that, offer what we have, as if to someone who is given the attention of someone already living well -for that is all I would wish for myself, or hope for someone I cared for most, upon the orientation for a goal, to recieve. 
            <br>&emsp;Theres waeriness here, as who one should be when the basis for things is merely that, is such that we are little adolescent in that this freedom from tradition feels like liberty for our more impassioned interests. And otherwise, I am in fact just not there, and at that, am perhaps more  human in my humility, as not to squander over such fact: as if that end of being full for the sake of what my kid will recieve, is itself some neccessary or restraing point which I am ordained and or judged upon to reach. For tradition has no say in the matter. But we are personally then only somewhat modern otherwise.
        </div>
        <div id="headhigh">
            Looking at our position is a dull affair; for in such regards, there would be otherwise excitement, if our address was concerned with our desires and wants, and our needs as much as our pleasure could spare. 
            <br>&emsp;So, by that, we'll make such comments, beginning namely with the common course of our way, and its murkiness during converse with those of a familial or friendly matter. 
            <br>&emsp;For starters, the task laid upon me is not one of potentail, but rather a non obscure commissery. That is, we must keep our head up, remain peacefull and proportianate to the place at hand. Agreements carry not much further than common and or remedial courtesty; but otherwise waver as we obstain ourselves from personal discussion. And of such an offer, there lies the subject matter which I wish to unwind.
            <br>&emsp;As a base, we have according basics. And of these, there are those which, principially, are not quite so, in that of their baseness they are but extended. Of such real basics, lies our common itinerary, namely our post within simple work, the according offer of an equally basic home, and all those orbiting elements of homely and or corporate polity, along with our own remedying and calibratory propiety. Beyond this though, sits what was otherwise blown out, as the depths beneath that common basis were either to heralded, or too uneasy in their attentuated success. By this I mean our cares for nutrition and education. While the outer ring near that common basis is to do with matters that were at one point externally regarded, all while our common basis held to little posture and ease under the shifting depths beneath. And as that ground has settled, and our common basis is not so drug, so do those nearby bounds reflect a complexion of outwardness, in that our regards are merely as such and inacted accordingly, as opposed to being seperate from the bounds at hand. That is, we clean and prepp, speak and consent; and that as these are personal matters which tie the externality to me, since our efforts and regards are engrossing of such matters, that so to as that bound of engrossing reaches further out, that so do such encased matters become equally within our grasp. In the sense that one learns to clean their room, and latter on how to fill out a form for a license, and at that drive a car, that so does one learn how to communciate an interest in working somewhere, and at any rate how to comment on and or reflect upon one's truest cares and interest, and the converse of this amidst people near at hand. As it stands, outside this basis are the matters of relations, profession and contribution. And each perhaps, is somewhat external due to our unfamiliarity; but so too in our grasp on comparable matters, and our sense at that, we identify these foreign matters similarly, and approach them as mysteries that are becomingly less so. By that count, our outwardly nature is merely a mark of extending our capabilities and congeniality to tasks, as to broaden our personal standing. Which, again, is comparable to one who learns to walk, then talk, clean and afford fun; and so to are we bridging the gap between our solidified state and the common pleasures that hold relativley accessible means. That is indeed a development property, and one which can only disclose its steps through relfection. As for now, I can say that our external regards are more related to the views of our passion; as such cares are beyond our current or anticiapted personal matters. Our outward nature though, as said, is merely a steadying segment of our personal stature: as one achieves through learning and expereince. And of that, I can identify specifically, of such a claim, that online dating and similar recreational invovlement, training and or minor itineraries for an advance in flexible provision, and a couresening of our adulthood and final regard through the lanes and time of modernity and the public realm, each hold the bill as those elements whicdh are situating themselves as fruits of our average waking day. "Both in terms of the clarity and its conseuquent excitment, along with the levelness to our ability and regualirity in yeilding the fruits of such elements, and the current pleasne and satiety which such calmness within the braoder world brings."
        </div>
        <div id="plasticpeace">
            The situtaion then, is that our outward glare is substantiating itself, but on one front which is only fertile so much as we are actually acquriing experience, and the other, which is to do with our clarity on the matter, and the driving benefit of our current ease and succession.
            <br>&emsp;Quite faily, I consent to the latter in a reasonable fashion, and expect little from us as our timely approach in fact bring such elements to life. Surely this cannot be done right now or in a day, but is akin to the whithering of a stream, and its continual degrade of the land its part of; only, our case is the opposite, in that of our erosion of the moments ahead, that it is done so with currents that remark our sight of relations and friendship, profession and oppertunity, contribution and purpose. All the while, our periodical regards are such that principle holds are way; and by that, holds some agreement to that which pleases, or abides itself, to our clarity of such sprouting future. This is an awry notion, as we surely do not have to mould ourselves on the immediate basis of familiarizing ourservles with those outward elements now, but reach them merely, and progress. Neither do we though, have such free and or permitted reign to muzzle ourselves based on our prospects. Surely, as that future is far away, that our aim would be best, in its basis at least, if it disposed us to such a future. 
            <br>&emsp;The future we speak of though is simply a situation, of the kind that remarks someone's educational development, whereby they then new how to perform a skill. And of that, our hope, is to be so familiar and kept in the realm of relations, profession and contribution, that we are invovled with such things, and at least experienced enough to be returing to so. Right now, we are but reaching, and at that, are quite preliminary to a certain claim. In contrast, our means to finding work is such, that both our agreement to it and our austere means to acquriing so, is such as to remedy any concern of it happening, and at that faciliate the promise and according pleasure of it breezily happening. "As one would upon a coming pruchase, whereby their cash holdings would open up all certainty and thus excitment of the coming good."
            <br>&emsp;I guess our problem is in the nature of our current happiness, and how it is not so easily accepted as a place in which we freely realize ourselves. Those coming bounds are really comforting, and steadying at that; but they are not like passions, which rile up from our idle stead. We are pleased right now. And at any rate, our communication could be grounded on the basis of what we care for, and are with respect to. For the latter is indeed our steadying bounds, while the former marks our care for memoirs, LOTR and Diablo. That is simply who I want to be. As it stands, our youtube is not so promising or based in as much as it is an occupation, or source of comfort that is in such a equitable way. Nor, does it truly mark our care and interest, as I feel like we are going over old grounds, and at that for the sake of drawing attention and or showing our shine. I wish to go through more definite positions, and at that herald ourselves as we truly are as a man of positions; and at that be seen, and brought to more primary positions. That is our way: and upon it, I would have a child. For now though, we are indeed home; but so is that a mere side of an otherwise level basis, of which our own simple provisions is lined. I've stated my ideas and sight for growth, and am otherwise here and settled. The needs and comfort here are solid, and at worst fine. And of that, we are so crowded with cares and awe, that I have no burrowing need to press on and situate ourselves outwardly. Such bounds are merely there, while our mind is without haste to incorporate them. At any rate, our shifting grounds by virtue of complancency and or inefficeincy, draw me away from caring for what is outside, as the steady satiety we have from our near basis is accordingly unsettled. Again, developmental regards may assign values to certain things as being more primary, and our oringins and thus paces in meeting so; but in the basis I have, which I can only say covers a home and common workings, is such that it is plain and comfortable to a satisfying tee; and so much as we are ineffiecinet in it, or worn  from making our use of it, so is our path without any haze, but acceptence for the strides ahead. Partially so, as I may merely be choosing our common basis over those apparently outward; but so is the place and time for that situated at different points of that common basis. For now, while were here, and generally so much as our position relativley stays -at least in this foreign land- that we are not so keen on extending that basis. And perhaps that reason is because the current basis is our home via the moment, but not an era of time
            <br>&emsp;It may not be fine for us to be here and act as though we are given a home. Perhaps our occupation is in need of a press, and thats fine. But this current basis does not hold such an extent, that of any outward growth which I could achievee, that too little is here which I care for. I would rather maintain the basis, and flourish through that.  We are not neccessarily leaving, but an understanding is something to attest. For we may squaler our time, sincerely and or perceived. But such an understanding is not but an ask, for our dynamics still require me. I do believe that our time now, is heraled as the basis for basis sake, and holds little which is promsied for beyond our remedying the structure of that basis. But in that, I am without much pain. There is some growth to be had, but again, so much as it is for me to reach, I would rather not, as the change is both a loosening of me as to incorporate that, or a obligation which is not fufilling in our current place. Our commincation can facilitate that. And as much as we care for, a tool for our homely basis can be something akin to journalling, whereby we remark on any communicaitive or remedial needs. Complimenting that are viewer interests, and that of games. But otherwise, our outline of study for instance, is a more cared for embellishment of what I already seek to know. To that path, our current needs, and our otherwise truest bend, we follow.
        </div>
        <div id="morethanaview">
            There is a boldness which brings apprehension to my heart; but our clarity is such as to paint an easy way. Simply, we are in what is known as a common basis; which one might describe as an ordinary place. Relativley, matters outside one's self are always external, and  passion is but a far glance of such things. While a view of such things as being near, or forthcoming to be in our bounds, remarks outwardness, in that such things are outside, but regarded as near or at least soon to be within it. There is the matter of primary  aspects though; for a kid, for instance, who is on the edge of his youth, may see the licensing and operation of a vehicle; while he otherwise holds the bounds of chores, schooling and familial dealings. As a man, I say that besides my collegues, that friendship is a dear and pleasing element to my life; and as if were, developments have brought me away from such a crucial standing. But as it were, the bounds of profession and posterity are such as to be less primary than our basic homeliness and self regard. These things in an even sense, hold more principle than those further bounds. Now, the point is not that they are external, for that is a mark of your regards, as their being outward is equally a more settled measure of that. Only, the actually wisdom of prioirity, in that, be it anticipated or not, we can at least say that of our basis, it is well in commonly primary sense. Our home is garnered as is our health and industry. And as it were, flourishing from there is all I really seek. Although time has brought me away from those outward things, in that they are not so familiar to me despite their means to be so, that beyond the dvelopmental reason for this being so, that with them or not, I still just wish to flourish. By that, our growth is such that of something peering its head into our sight, so does the simplicity of friendship and relations lie, along with the broader motions of profession and purpose. For clarities sake, those former elements are not so simple for me due to our development, while the latter elements are not things whose abscence rains on what is otherwise deemed normal. As it were, my current path is such that for each kind of element, that they equally feel outward, and near at that. But, our current place is such, that locally we are not so keen to faciliate an outward change; nor is the transition to that more ample spot one which is angled against our content in simply being there (however then promising). And so of our current cares, they are on the potential change and the simpler incorporations of relations that are there. These being so fundemental seem like priorities comapred to profession. Even though I see them each as accessible, so is one more elicitive to our care.  
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, I am only going to be; nor do I swelter at the promise of some alternate place. For in this and that, we are flourishing; and surely our acquaintence with these outer things will bring much leniance and adaptaion from that. I only see, as a mixture coming out of our developing ways, a care and or possibility for relations to be had amidst our own provisioal state. Which normally presses me to such things. And now perhaps, while we are fine to be there and commonly bent for such promise, or here, with a more explicit angle of interest and stability, paired with a bend towards that coming position, so are we fine in this simpler realm. What is thus said, is that of those matters beyond those of friendship, so are they of  less conern for me, in their solidity at least. And by that, our current post is not angled or bent towards that. Our development can speak to prioritiy and disposition, while otherwise we are fine to see, as the future holds any regard, that of a post which is more promising, or elicative rather of growth, that such a post is near, for our choosing, and withotu contraritety to most of the flourishing we now reach: but, of where our mind is at liberally, so is it the mere advancment to what we see and remedial, and at that in our grasp for the claim of comfort. And of that, friendship seems more fundemental and worth our surrounding care, while professions and contribition sit as marshalling channels, for both our coming era and postumous sake

            When I think of our studies I think of a volume with many different pockets; and when our mind is stiff, or leary, so do those pockets hold more space, and at that room for us to fill in (ie. assumptions and or imagined details). This is not ideal in true sense, nor as comforting, as the presumptions are seldom pleasant. Yet, when we are more circumpsect and personally kept, so do those spaces define themselves more, and at that tear me less as less defined spaces surround. 
            <br>&emsp;My point, is that this is a relfection, or remark rather, as to something I care; and as if a sport or craft, so are we saying that our ability to engage with it, and well enough as to earn our joy of involvment, that such regards are for that purpose placed, as if to see that we are pleased, seeking improvement, or, content with our average expereince; for in that the nature of the activity is given, as, in comparison, a task we had to do, and felt the consequences from not, would see more concerning remarks regarding our inability to do so.
            <br>&emsp;In a word, our indifference is such that of our current scenario we are pleased, as are we to others. Whether we are here or there is one thing; and the elements which set us to either is somewhat dynamic. But whichever I am fine; and so much as we are displeased with our home, or nudged out the door, so am I able to transition, and see the offer from whats new. I think the way I'd describe it, is that a small plate with a heap of the richest food is not something I retreat from. Our life though could afford some width to that platform; and although passion is not much of a reputable force, so is there an edge beyond us which is not but more than what a longer commitment could earn. And, nearer than that, are elements which are more akin to tasks, in that we simply act and engage in common ways. Our development is such that being so open is not always an interest, as the solidity we currently have is precious. But the stake of such solidity is more appropraitley forgiving to the point, where its density need not be so for some infiinte high peak. There is a broader light which we see, and a surrounding complexion which truly resembles the cares I seek. And in this, our base is not precious that it fear exposure or additions. Friendship and relations speak out here; and naturally so, as our past has grown similarly. Work and other things of a civil sort sit outside me in terms of interest, but do hold an inevitbale regard. At least, while before our ultimate regards were based on our brilliance, now they are more with respect to our actual place in the world. And of the cares we once thought would drive our position, so is that position one of a humble and common sort; and our complexion is such as to be glossened by our interests; which have room and care to be so full, for our freedom and ease is strengthed by that forthcoming clarity (of position). Perfection held such far regards, but was based on what our perfection could represent of me personally, and to that what I would be stationed with in being so remarkable. And, indeed, there was both a fear of not reaching so; and even a mild excitment at this eventual thought.
            <br>&emsp;In a word, Ryan is content in a room or home, and as a person they are fine to do so and or consent to an itinerary which affords prospect. And, as the story goes, in being Ryan, there was both a mix of reservation and concession to being alone, as such a place was where being was procurred. Now, such being is present all around, and mere choice and or experience is all that keeps him from the baser comforts. Promise from work is equal in oppertunity as that of fun and friends; only, the latter is like the warmth of a day: a preference. While the former, however possible, is a mere elective, as to align with the itinerate means. As a man, they are but a shining source in their points of support and care. We may shine privatley, and at that expereince the warmth of the world marbled with solidarity. But so in this is there confusion, for the pillars of such being is such as to forsee some coming brilliance. This is an operative element though, for in our being we are without regards; only so when we rest or faulter. But as that draws a gaze as accords our height, so is our wish to have a friend, as perhaps motivated and or glossens that far view, that so can we see with a developed view that our choices can link the nearness of friends and oppertunity: that equally, there lies links to points of actual contribution. And while our previous heights encouraged me to be a certain way as to reach that, so was the expanse between our present and that as such as to pull our disposal to it in such a stretched out way. While our view of being somewhere where the activity is not attratice based on who we are, but is a motion of our giving, that so, as our interests are concerned, do they have a borader and nearer volume to fill, as our regards for such a future elicits. Theres just a more defined and calling route of full being, that the interests which seep life from such concreteness, as if a solid platform to materialize themselves, that so is this view a proper one.

        <div id="mistofourway">
            I don't know what commradery is; as it indeed feels nice to help, or see ourselves on some public path. But I cannot say if this is for some obligate reason, a good feeling, or a mix of the two. 
            <br>&emsp;At that, if I were confused about some circumstance, I would wish to remedy it if the result of it was both a pang of sympathy, along with some radiating threat. In this case, the aim would be best placed in remedying the confusion, as opposed to acting on the subject conceived.
            <br>&emsp;In both cases there is an undoubtable contrast between desire and aversion. Yet, such a state (of one way or the other, by our wish at least) is not so reflective of our truest state. For in that, we are neither confused, and at that free from worry, or at least pursuing a hold of it, and grasping it at that; nor is our whim to public one which has any yearning or restless need. Rather, we are in a sense, controlled, steady, and with a sight that is pitched on all things near; and of such troubles which we see ourselves engaged with, their nature is such as to reflect both a broad and elongated path: the calmn consistency of our steps then precede such stretches via a forthcoming regard, but of a appraching sort rather than a reaching one. And, at that, a receding one, which falls flat and or turns inwards. As well, reproach remarks the common settlings of one, who is not so stiff as to fall flat and stale as they loose their pace; nor are they too far forward (in that reaching sense) as to be pulled away from a milder pace. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, our remarks are such of nature and its sprouting encumbency, and that of apprehension, as perhaps pairs with a steadying environment, whereby the regards one has are awkwardly set with respect to such a steadying way, and that trouble which remains. In modern time's especially, that trouble may brew as the rot of freedom -the pits of excess.
            <br>&emsp;From my experience, putting your hand in cold water upon it being burned is comparable to resolving not to drink anymore following the pain of a hangover. This natural settling, 'as if no pain was our equilibrium, and our place was either in peace or remedy', comes about in ways that are not marshalled, any more than one elects to treat an injury. Behaviour is a tricky thing, as, like our senses, no one is alone in its bodily regard; but still, even if our guidance, relfection or deliberation angles our steps to a remedy, so are they not the driving factor. "As behavior is a given concern, as if added ontop of our baser remarks, so is the heart of that base consequential in ways incorprative as behaviorir is to such base." That is, there sits elements of our baser selves which mingle along, outside our attention. Whereas a hangover is a intense event, so are there lingering events with less concentrated effects. For instance, the quality of our breathing, and the effect it has on the balance of oxygen and CO2. "Mouth breather syndrome as they call it." And the point, is that such motions of our basis are such, that the effects of them are mechanical, and at that neccessary, or better yet exhibitive in a way encumbunant to the parts and their conseuqence: and this coontrasts with subjects of our otherwise regard, whereby we may see something going on, and wish for it, or retreat from it, but all from things which we are not so basely responding to, but focusing on. Such attention, in totality, is surely basic and at that mechanical. But for our own sake, the foregin objects which this side of things regards, is such as to be remark the behavioural element to our basis, and its apprehensive side in particular. For you see, meeting a craving, or averting a threat, are quite similar urges; for each, the wish is a relief from some impulse, 'like the one which strikes you when  your hand is too close to the fire'. Cravings are like this, as are passions, in that they are not so much about the object in question, but the remedy of your restlessness. "As if without such a thing, you couldn't sit still. But such an urge is akin to gasping for air, while in the case for a craving, there is a saturation of a chemical within neural lanes; or in the case for passion, there is some seen scenario or thing which compells action, and at that brings you out of the inactive and or contained state which your passion is staked on." 
            <br>&emsp;What I would say simply, is that the mirror of this seeking position, and its purpose as relief, is within interests: or in other words, the former is reaching, based on some remedying need, while the latter is an approach: which itself, holds a front and back complexion, one being of dispostion (as our remedy reflects a flaw), the other of positivity (as your are forwardly, yet from a place of content, drawn). 
            <br>&emsp;In a word, human, is the topical question for all within that kind. And such a subject, to me, is based on that question of disposition. Which, in explicit terms, I identify as a configuration of our bodied elements. And at that, varies itself across injury, the root of passion, the basis for craving, and the more mysterious, albeit modern intrigue towards things around, and its identity of 'a progress towards something for the basis of what can only be described as interest'. All may be mechanical, but so is their a mightily modern property which contrasts with the pre-modern property of negativity (or an impulse to cease and or relieve). Such positivity, as I often say, is merely a configuration like those which procure a negative relief. Better put, the bodily basis which I am remarking, regardless of form, is about relief, in that each part serves as an input to that which surrounds us, and at that outputs what we could only describe (of things living) as a press, step, will to live. The soul discprency within this account, is of the complexion of such relief, and whether it is of, more or less, reproach, approach or reaching. As well, non living sits as a flatter state beneath reproach; as one merely says that we are moving slower, with tenderness, but no so much as to come to a stop. In fact, the near practical struggle in doing this describes the landscape best, in that, of a state of approach, we are moving quicker than a state of reproach, but not as quick as a hasty reach. While a halt, or idleness, is all too motionless, whereas reproach, or an even milder form called stillness, is merely less motion, but enough to remain moving. "While those who cannot be in such a slow state, hurry forward as to be in movement, or stiffen up, and get pushed by the need to move (restlessness) -from behind, by the coming wall of time."
            <br>&emsp;How things are, such is about that wall of time and its procurment of our true basis. But there is also an auxillary point, whereby this fundemental notion derives the moutain of intricacy which the basis affords. "The aggregates of existence so to speak." And here, we can speak to our effective origins as man, civilization, the concentrated history of our path to modernity, and our now current precipace to that very status. Because, at this point, there is what there is, and to an increasingly deep detail. But so are we, as part of this intricacy, reflecting, or responding rather, and at that, privy to the nature which affords our objective basis. "For such a basis, by these accounts, exhibits itself by its very bodily response to those other bodies around. Which one might describe as a portion of the stream being what it is, as a current, encumbuent to parts around." From this comes the all mighty limit to our modern preface: is my remark about our basis within reality, a exhibiter of something beyond that basis? Or, is my thought merely a reaction within the surrounding arrangments which it is of equal kind? And, at that, is the inquiry as to the pieces which such remarks and their subjects are based on, identifiable from such derived entities? 
            <br>&emsp;Indeed I don't know. To quote Mr Hume though, 'however much you attain the place of a philosopher, do remain a man'. From this, I welcome the quaint yet fair notion of that mechanical thought, and how, despite it being somewhat blurry in its potential yeilds, so ought the given nature of it being mechanical, or at least derived from the mystery which we squinting to see, that we would iron the basis for such lens, and at that sow in suitable paramaters as the instrument respects. 
            <br>&emsp;This in one notion mind you. The rest of my thinking, or attention rather, goes in an admittedly similar plane of inquiry, but without such epistomoligcal regard, but rather sets its investigation on describing the images which my otherwise untroubled mind sees. For may I not just be myself, and in that being, notice what I commonly do. Indeed, what I have is not a complete sentiment, but one who's virtue perhaps indiciates a problem otherwise. And that is such, that of our wish to see, or find the explanation for all, and understand such basis, that in these regards I see a deep apprhension, as if a remedy will be served upon uncovering such mystery. The mystery may be the source of the fear, or it may be something else, be it confused or pedantic curisoity and the conseuqent treat born upon such a fine insight. In a word, these efforts seem like that of an uneven man. As one who is at least angled to be otherwise, I can say, with almost no concession, that the wish to understand 'all', is not what our natural remarks care for. Rather, our ancient development and the culturure procurred around it, merely sprouted a consequent behaviur which was inaccurate in its portrait of the world, and at that, mistaken in the objects which it regarded. And it is such an important point, that we mention the current continuity of this, and how the source of the apprehension we have now, is merely born from those flawed conceptions. "And, in practice, their rooting into the cultural fabric, the faciliation by education and parenting, and the higher auxillary point of where our doubts even began to question. 'Does the earth really bind all the planets in its orbit, or is this perhaps not so?' Such is indeed a good question, but is quite inferior to the question which remarks the reason for the planets orbiting as they actually do -doubts of facts, explaining real ones."
            <br>&emsp;What I have then is a flowing idea, on of which is grafted onto the current continuity of things; and at that, remarks upon the flow of things that have preceeded this current step, and at that the fairly conceived steps forthcoming. "By virtue of what holds predictive strenght, namely reason and its obituary of points already come."
            <br>&emsp;As a quick note, Hume says that nothing can be known but that which we concieve; for even in our supposition of what something else is, so are the terms and notions which we (more or less) use to color it born from our prior experience. "Which itself also brings to question the nature of our paint: a mystery indeed of that which so mysterioulsy colors itself." No matter, my point is supposing how things are on a basic level is, with practical entirety, based on neccesity, musts, assumed reasoning for that which has come to be. Only, that property, of assuming the basis for exlpanation is liable to fallacy in a similar way as Hume concerns us with the mystery of our external regard. 
            <br>&emsp;I could explain, and have written this more plainly and well. But of this final point, I think the figure of it is sufficient. At least, unlike some portions of prose, of Hume's inquiry regarding limits, and my own remark of reason's basis, so could I in fact explain the meaning. And by this private nature, I'll let the clarity already given bear its state of suffice.

        <div id="ledger">
            The obituary of reason is in some sense a ledger, of all points which came and have passed. It would seem then, that such points, at least those in the ledger, hold the current possibility of evidence -from observation. Barring some details, we could say that, for predictions sake, that which has come will, or is at least fair to correlate with, that which will come. 
            <br>&emsp;Where there is some sticky buisness is when we consider the 'reasoning' for something, which is not based on what has already come. As it were, what is not of the ledger, is not of existence, or ingrained to the flow of continuity currently present. Such accounts are of contrivance -not a pejorative. This is indeed a starting argument, for of all points which have come, and of that one, or layer so to speak, which began, so is the contrived basis for that seperate from the continuity it afforded. 
            <br>&emsp;Evidence then is via existence, or things that is: of that which is. And the piecemeal nature of this may be described as an ocean of events; while the aggregate form may be a mere foramility of unison, whereby those piecemeal events associate with others. At that, comes a key parameter for meta-reasoning, which is, of the reasoning which it is the meta for, so ought the subjects of such inquiry be suitably identified. And, namely, there is a solid statement of modern times, which is, that events are the things we are seeking the basis for, and that of such events, there more or less perceived timeliness and the supposed beginning, is in fact not so exlpicitly set to presumably fair notions, but rather, the nature of time and duration as observed, and the otherwise inquisitive regard of such properties -as compares to contunuity within infinite sets- is not obviously congenial to any common notion of beginning. And, at that, as for the question, 'well, of such thing then, how is there origin, however you look at it?'. And here the second principle of modernity comes to play, in that, of the event which you are questioning, so is the basis for the question, about its origin, encumbant within the event in question; and at that, the mystery is one of identity, as opposed to an explanation of something fully defined.
        </div>
        <div id="taskofreproach">
            I am vulnerable to our waivering peculiarities. On one hand, those oddities are fair, in that reason has married herself to our sake, and our troubles are not so far and wide accordingly. And indeed, there is very little discontent which comes from this. But, there remains a need for the basics of living, and at that a remedy of this due to its impact on our interests. And such interests have become our heart and way; perhaps, in part, because our mending of the nearest troubles, opens our sight to things equally close. "while those subject to the pangs of foreign command, seek things of an equally far sort."
            <br>&emsp;As it were, receding from our wants, on both the backs of suitability in what we are right to earn, and otherwise levelling of our actual self regard, as not to be as ill tuned in that, makes such a state welcome. For indeed, our wishes come from a mix of deep and or whimsical passion, but passion no less. Our calmness and content reaches for little though, and at that pursues all but what draws our eye, and through steps which merely approach, as if the cue was a positive one truly.
            <br>&emsp;But we come to this issue when our dimmness seeps in, in part due to the develoment of our self regard and our proclivity to ignore it as the aims which it has procurred become both disposed by us and accepted by others. "like we are now on the path we seek, and can celebrate, like most other's do." And in fact this is fine, for our need for something outside our selves does not push us to deserve it by being perfect, and we even ourselves out otherwise with the actual interests which guide our care. "As opposed to letting our wobbling ways ingrain the wishes that come from them." What I see then, is that the world seems both far and wide, and full of noise and tumult. Our generous and tender gait takes little of this in, and at that more lightly responds, as if it were the wind. But as we stiffen, however locally fine, so do the cries and pedantry of various sources around hit me with more gratuity and luggingness. Due souly from the fact that our reception of anything is according to the stiffness of our selves as recpient. This is indeed a wearisome state. For the troubles of the world are in fact continous with all of things, and together at that. And from this, our fullest cares extend not but more than the frailness of future care and ordinance. Which, as if a grip on the matter, we've truly settled into our personal way, and seen the substance of oru future (as such a concern is drawn) within actual positions of provision and care. This is not some reasurance but an identity within  our moments of a looser sight, where our place farther ahead is gleemed -and of the shapes they seem contributory, rather than what our brilliance receives. 
            <br>&emsp;By this, I am merely remarking upon the real world, and at least how its progress and extent squash these pedantic remarks. Yet, besides the grim and rancourous states which these kind of apprhensions can be, so is our more fair and common state (of this sort) more incidted and weighed upon by the choices of others around me. Indeed, there is little which sparks such a concern on the street, at work; nor is there any real regard for much at home. But, people are subsrcruved to news outlets in a comparable manner as those who are part of a church. Its their source, their inlet for some worldly remark. And the issue it seems, is in our relation to the ones watching, rather than what is being expressed. For indeed, I care not about someone who's house is on fire; nor do I care about some fibre on the parchment of democracy -as I tend to hold the flattess regard as remarks the equal flatness of the whole garb. But when my folks, or their folks, or someone on a zoom call, or even a co-worker who says, 'ya, apparently that's whats going on', I truly panick, as if I am to agree, tell them that their inquiry is off, or I pass their prescence and attend to the truth I otherwise see, and all the trouble which comes from such commissery. And indeed, it is hard to hear this. For I relate to these sort of notions in that, of their identity, the color is off; and as for what it means, so is there an abscence of all regards beyond the position at hand. And such a lack of continuity marks the weakness of the actual strand, and its place amongst others. 
            <br>&emsp;With so little to see then, it is usually our own ignorance which fails. For sensibility, be it of how things are, or reproaching from the thin expression, is a balancing act with no cease. Like our personal ways, one of the reasons that our indolence is so poor is that our relations to others around feels obscure. Simply, our wishes reveal themselves as faulty, or at least unpromising as our confidence wains. And otherwise, if we obstain from the contrieties to our actual way, so are their excrements of seperation; at least, in our less than ripe state, so do others viamence, nievety, rose tinted suggestions and otherwise opinion that remarks a hole in the realm, ware against me. In some way, the view from others that acts without respect to the pastures of our near life, sparks trouble when such grasses are not trimmed, and we in some way feel unable to inhabit this ignored state. For being obscure is a matter of reception, in that if we are steady and vital, so may we firmly yet regally share our views and cares, as to feel good in offering our actual intent, and the solidarity this brings, and otherwise inputing others suggestions with a repsonse of about our interest elsehwere; and this removes any sense of defense or frustration.
            <br>&emsp;When we are not so steady or light though, people's given remarks feel presumptuous, as if our cares otherwise are taboo or off. For we are left with a muddy disposition, which cares not for what is being offered, but cannot speak for what it does. And in some comparable way, others worldy views seem presumptuous, and at that, oblivious to the fact that we don't see things that way. Perhaps, this is why those who are close cause such a struggle, as strangers ask little from you, and are owed little at that. While our friends and family deserve much more, and require it at that. This is why wishing for something from them beckons under our twist of communication. For the repor is more or less off. At that though, there comes this auxillary point of needing to communicate with your parents; and being on good and clear terms is one aspect which remarks a healthiness to our relationship's complexion. In that, one of the things that one must learn to do, particularly when the difference of age is such that our personal efforts and level headed view of the world don't give a strict alignment, that we would be able to communicate what we really seek, how to describe our doubts, or at least suggest that there are details which govern some fair reservation or concern. And, where I'll end, beyond our ability to politely and honestly say no, and all considerations alike, so would it be fair and fruitfull to be able to understand where their coming from, and at that, input a fair expression of their actual place. For when I see them watching the news, I see a group, a company, a meeting; one of which their privy to. But thats all it is. Their merely attending a meeting. Their part of a team. And considering how much they actually say of the matter, it brings a breezy cheer to us, in that the value of a team and its impact beyond the buisness it conducts, is such as not to warrant much fear or resentment, especially when are folk are but almost no responsive to it. Their hearts may be corrupt, and their opinions may be angled. But so is this a matter of communication. Indeed, the trouble of hearing the news or scrolling through twitter is that the thinness and vaguery of the medium depicts the world in a fragmented and chaotic way. And by that, we feel like we are witnessing something terrible, and are uninvovled at that. "Like were hiding from a threat which everyone else is stairing at." This indeed gives us a seperation feeling. And it would seem, that if we simply saw this as something our parents were privy to, and accepted that, then what they were watching would not hold this commanding force, and bear us reptence from igrnoring it. And, at the very least, softening this awkward edge, would let us focus on how our partnets actually are and feel. And surely, they say little. And of what they really think, it really comes to fruition in their own reservations and advice. But so are we then tasked wtih the delicay of reproach and consideration. Which is a position, compared to humouring the teleprompter, that I'd prefer being in. "Let the world be as it is, and all those who are defined otherwise, let their acts be a subject to you, rather than us having to ignore and or repudiate the source. Let the world be vast as it is, and remain flat despite these eratic depictions. For I believe that our place amidst such point where repudation is the care, is such that we are not able to settle back while others here something which our actions don't respect. For in that, our communication is garnered on us being able to reason as such. But let us do so; and to those who we deal with, their views can be as they are, along with those who initially express. For the problem thus, is neither theirs or the recpients concern, as the world flattens their at most idealistic aims away, and remains progressive in a normal way. What we are left with, is not fear of pedantry and opinionative impact, but in speaking to those who feel such way. For in my view, the world is levelled, and remains fairly constant. And at that, of those who handle some measure of fibre, so is the brevity of that nearly minor -considering how many of the 300 million americans care. Effectively that is, for all who in fact do, or have some passing care, their actual impact in its fullest marshal is but a twink of the quilts fibre; and otherwise, beneath this full marshal, they are subject merely to those opinionated around, and at that, fall forward into their own opinions, or are apprhensive about others. Such a state of relations though, is quite an aggregate amidst other groups, who surely vary in their ideal proclivites. And so if we are part of that, or at least the gorup were part of has some tang of such proclivity, than our task is not to say that their wrong; for our sense that it is is not governed or built by such forcefull and sure actions. But rather, at least it would seem, that we let fools be fools, while we remain their friends, and hold no illseated wish from them, nor frustration in dealing with them normally. For we need only the clarity, composure and understanding to offer the cares, concerns and regards, for the interests, needs and pursuits which, to us, actually matter."

            The issue with modern discourse is that it is quite poor in sticthing the topics of converstation with the many strands of the world around. 
            <br>&emsp;Now, if their is discussion about some specific matter, or some generic view of something broader, is the actual topic not of important? Even if it is represented poorly, and through a poor medium at that, ougth we ignore? 
            <br>&emsp;This is indeed our struggle. For the problems which are, and the way the world really is, in some ways warrants a view which is vast, delicate, continous and reputable as that. But, when we are drunk so to speak, or complacent, so do we have little views. And at that, those who  have the crumbiest of views, still rise above me. And at that, our regard for them, comes from a sort of lazy repudation, as if to say theeres no issue, let me sleep. Only, there is an issue; its simply far away. 
            <br>&emsp;And this is where family and fortune come in. 
            <br>&emsp;What do we do then? Place their expression and our folks reception of it fairly.  But see, however fair or eradict the sentiment is, that it is entirely near term, and quite irrelevant to the far off changes that come from the continuity of things. Were talking about a single step. 
            <br>&emsp;So do we relax, level our view of this as to be agreeable and considerate, and otherwise let the near term be guided by pundants and idealists? Worrying about how little the moment even impacts the millions of strands seems unimportant, for the change of those takes decades, if not centuries. And, weirdly, as our composed stance bears remarks to that, so does our drunken state even, or tipsy one rather, still keep up with that.

            So I am surely not a scientist, or a mathmetician, nor a good thinker to any solid degree. I merely ask nice questions, and remain aloft while doing so as to add further suspciion and detail. Indeed, as these do come about, I often find them reptuable; and at that, I tend to give myself some credit as to the strenght of our inquriy. But like all thinks, it pays more to know what you don't know, for that which you do is in some ways dealt with. And, as one who's aim is merely to expand themselves, and perhaps the range of things, so is my survey and brick laying in need of more than pure producitivty and craft, but sensibility and fair regard. In other words, if I am putting on a show, then my blemishes may simply be hidden by our outward shine. But, if I am to remain ordinary, and merely mark the scenery as it is not yet known, then so am I suitably limited by how well I contain myself in such an umbridled approach. For in common pursuits, the response of other's is the limiting factor. And indeed, or self assurance comes from the credit I give myself upon my inquiries; and, our meager hope for other's to respond to this well leaves me tinkering over the product in question. But when the charter of our efforts is set in a more dear and scholarly way, then we are but a man with curiosity, and delight at his fielding discovery. These sorts of developments may be large, but their strenght and character is pleasing only for a man. While the inventor of the toilet saw great praise by virtue of the utility he offered, our regards are akin to a painting, whereby the lenght of our care is such as only to be seen when the mass of it finally stands up tall. "As if we were painting it all this time on the ground." And by that, someone else may see: but so will our eye be past that line, and into somewhere farther. By that, we are  leaving a wonder, an insight to mystery; and is if guided by some constant care for receptivity, be it of validation of our satisfaction, or the remedy of the enclosure which such a awry life can bring, so do we stain our posterity with fidelity. If, perhaps, only to further guide us in some way: for the pursuit forward as drive by our interest, holds much of its plan and care within the respects of what has already been given. And be it honor, that lingering hope to be received, or the support which these established norms can bring, as we pursue a path which is otherwise entire, but unclear. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, our core reproach away from unfair certainty is in the descriptivie suitability, of how we would seemingly best describe things, and otherwise not take for granted that such arrangments are not simply guided by mechanics, but that of their actual base and origin, that such neccessity is contemporaily off. And the example I give to portray this is a real clever one, but is quite effective in laying out the difference. You see, an interaction between things remarks a sort of law, at least on the premise that such interactions apprea consistent. And by that, there seems a line of cause and effect, as if the outputs of such laws can be traced, and at that derive the function which they (the actions) are representative of (or marshalled by). This, frankly, is the root of science, and its depth of moving complexitiy. But you come to this awkward question, as to what procurred either A) the laws, or B) the initation of them and that material which is subject to them; and at that, as C) if the laws are in some sense material, then how are they seperate from the matter which we see subject to them, and at that, what is that matter truly, or basically rather, composed of? And this indeed is the meager question of ontology, which in many ways summarizes itelfs in the tradtional notion of 'ex nihol', meaning 'something from nothing'. And of this, there is much which can be otherwise explained, by virtue at least of the primary rule of modernity, namely that of the objects we conceive, that regarding them as events is souly suitable; and that of such events, the mystery of their origin is so as to be part of their nature, and at remarks a faintness in the questioning of their nature as if such nature was properly known; meaning, in otherwise, the origin of an event, whose origin in fact is encumbent within the event, and at that is a false question, seeing as the subject in question is not identified without the actual property being sought, and at that, fails to be an actual subject which can be questioned. "Where is the red in this red apple?" Its simply an oddity. And, on top of that, is that of the events which we seek, and incopletely identify, that our notion of origin and duration, which we suppose within its identity, or more basically try and define, that of such notions, contemporaily at least, so are such remarks fairly antiquated, in a way that compares to the questioning of continuity within either space and time; and as those questions were dealt with in the late 1800s by Peano and Cantor through developing set theory, so has the reality which the pieces of nature appear to be reminiscent of, hold no features or place that warrants a notion of 'beginning, or duration': at  least as is commonly or tradtionally supposed. "For time is measurable of the bodies which we are asking the origins for. But as each property seems comparably, in the tick tockiness at least, so is the character of it in the actual subject, not as such as to color the character of the property in which the common question often supposes."
            <br>&emsp;This indeed is all to remove neccessity, for such wish to find such is really an appeal to finality, and the absolute. Which seems quite arrogant and immature, as if being inquistive is falsely favorable. And I am not sure where I put this, but a notion of contrivance comes to be, in that, of the explanations for how things, be of this or that matter, came to be. For indeed the 'beginning' question may be poorly placed, but so is the basis of nature a mystery then. And whichever proprties are used to properly define, so are such insights currently unknown. But, one of the oldest tools in the books, is in saying that, of that which is, it is so for it must be. And that, of the current motions of things, they are not such as born from basic web of things which has been continously proprogating. No. Instead, the beginning of things, and introduction of substance at that, was introduced, on the basis that of such beings, in time or body, could not, as is supposed, come from nothing. And of this ancient point, I say that in some ways the suggestion is fair; for the mystery of origins is hazy otherwise. And, at that, the arbitrariness of existence would then be a clear insight, for the product of it would simply be a result of those contrived laws. Perhaps, our discovery of gravity was all there was, and was indeed the source of the substance which we were a forcefull arrangment of. And having both the gravity and material introduced would be quite assuring, for the roots more or less would be in check, and our only task would be to describe its output. 
            <br>&emsp;But, I have this pure example, and at that a mark of weakness for such suggestion. Simply, as things are, they generally remark development. And, of this, there is the modern notion of aggregates, and how in fact, the bodies we see are but binding sets of baser pieces; and like a spider web which forms concentraed strings and hollows when put in a box, so is the large scale clustering of the universe (and its branches) a mere result of that. As such, the objects in question are that, which upon slight anisotropic differences, produced complex aggregation. And indeed that layer of fabric and its strands are what we see. But where I find meta-reasoning, or neccessity, weak, is that at all points of depth, and points of progress within the development of material, there is not one position where an argument of contrivance would be less fitting than the other. Firstly, there is almost entirely no strenght in suggesting that our contemporary view of evidence and its drawn reasoning is a true threshold which the most basic of neccessities is fit for. Not only are their facts which we have a figure for, but dont inwardly know, so is their an objective line of supposition, which beyond the flatter curve of acquiring new facts, that even beyond, and curved about (by virtue of the waivering nature of predictions), that we would make new discoveries and insights, or at least understood more from what we already knew, as to more reasonably anwser those ontological questions. Which, in other words, means that our view of the lighter portions of the world may expand, and indeed their are evident mysteries; but too, of the depths, may we further discover, or at least reasonably suppose. While those pawning neccessity seem to sit in such depths, and offer a neccessary basis for the lighter levels above. Beyond the mechanicsm by which they do so, and how within the realm of light we deeply suppose, there is this question of contrivance, and whether it is indeed the explanation of nature? And by my account, the contrivance which the respectable state of modernity has drawn, is such as to be equally merritable as slotting in the contrivance at any prior point of development. For all contrivance says, is that of the substance and motions which are, their state so to speak, was introduced. And like a ball which may in fact be rolling because it was let down the hill, so would the placement of the ball half way down the hill and with the motion that it would otherwise reaosnably have, produce the same subsequent steps. Surely, we have evidence for their being a higher point on the hill; and consequently, we've lit the depths beneat the point which once seemed a threshold of mystery, and at that a level for contrivance. Modernity perhaps has merrited itself as being so deep, that its evident depths may seem to go no further; and at that, contrivance has what is factually a root level; and at that, a threshold whereby contrivance can then settle in. "For surely, discrete particles and their promulgation into complex structures was merely introduced." 
            <br>&emsp;I could say then, that the nearness of real modernity is such, that the magnitude of its grandeur is such that little may be seen further than by those who are curious; as their is indeed so much observed complexity and physcality, that of such a reputable basis, which is to say a deeper level in which contrivance can then afford, that seeing any level below is difficult. But this is a fairly pathetic attempt on contrivances part; as it almost is too comfortable in the barren realm in which it has been pushed to exist it: 'as if, finally, no more, I can finally settle here. I miss the heavens though'. But time will go on, and the existence which contrivance is meant to afford will become further complicated, and less needing of contrivance. Moreso, especially, will the beliefs of the past, which held confirmation based on the shallow levels of reasoning which their contrivance then mightily implored, will further be reduced, to points where not even the idea of contrivance holds any sway, and at that any acceptibility to the contrartieties that a rational view of nature deplores. In other words, the character of theology continously looses its garb, and becomes nothing more than a minor fact; as if a pinnacle fact, which did nothing more than push to dominoes, whose falling lead to a complexity which is entirely and, with scales for acceptiblity, known. Poor miracles and superstition: how art thou to be when all that is contrary is surely known. Where can we be now that our own being is deemed antiquated, nor favorable? For modernity gives eternal rest, by its deepest base.

            So Hume remarks about a man ontop of a moutain, who, in such heights is demonstrating their virtue and prowess. As he says, 'the turblenet waters below don't scathe his tranquilitiy'. But here, there is the notion of compassion, and how such a person, pleased and untainted, notices the taint of others, and at that finds relief through compassion: as if an ointment to their sympathy. To me, this reflects a line, where the plainess of reality is seen and you are fine to personally be; while the shifting of such line causes you to become burdened with the images and or foresight of other people's suffering. 
            <br>&emsp;In a way, the news, and media in general, provokes a large amount of compassion; that, or it invokes poltiical concerns. On the one side, I am fine to let them swoon over the struggle of someone misfortuned in a fire. While we are otherwise at peace with their expereince, for I see it comparably to how we deal with expereince: which is indeed not so dramatic or perilous. How many times does someone, upon misfortune, say things are ok, or 'were strong and will get through this'. The news ignores the actual meaning behind this, in common things at least. They shower the situation with compassion, and this is great, and hardly something for me to feel awry about; in that, seeing the scenario for what it is, a mere misfortune and its progress from people, I am ok for others to be overly compassionate. Where things get muddy is when the scenario is less specific, and more broad, and at that, there is a call for change -as if a product of compassion. This is quite obscure, for the attention of those who hear things of the sort, is impactfull in imaginativ ways, and hard to dispell as something less strict.
            <br>&emsp;All I can say, is that when Austin Bats comes on, its like were on the wave of life and time, and at that at one with the world as we see. And indeed such a world is massive, and at that unsaturated with any putrid severity. But when we rest, so is that pace hard to retain; nor is our complacency something which ushers imaginative impressions away. Triggers of imagination are as merritable as you'd expect, and consequentail at that. Yet we may be trapped in it. And part of me says that the path moving forward is one where we are privy to the whole world, and upright enough to see it forwardly, nor to brazen in our rest as not to retain congruency to it when our pace slows (and the mass of it all is felt). That, and the imagination of what others see, and how our own sympathy gets derailed when we are not privy to the real world, seems a point of closure, as if our ignorance of certain things leaves holes for imagination to sit in. Its not a final sentiment, as our adaptive ways bring us further to see fully, and at that more stabily rest. But, as we respond to things by virute of our forward cares, so can those things which our instbailities bring, be tempered themselves. "For our shortcomings bring much horror; yet, as those horrors become clearly ficitious, as the size of register becomes huge, then so is the illusory nature of them easier to change: for their brevity holds no strenght." In that, as in all things, I merely be, honestly; and perhaps by gain in being so, further remove the trggers which unsettle such commisery. As we did with our aims of philosophy, so is our perpetuity of practice in need of its remedies: which is, for one, tailoring of the ill practiced wishes and whims, as to move forward withtou fear of what you wont recieve; and secondly, but noticing the hostility and or apprhesnions which comes when our practice is ill placed (and at that mistake).
            <br>&emsp;Indeed this is a strange notion, whose source is not entirely known. If we are well practiced, then our delusion will not settle in; even though there is falsity and a juvenile disposition which springs at any slip. As it were, we always slip, and at that, humour the edges of such proclivity as our composure is less then secure. So we know their there. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps its the reason for tending to these things which is awkard. For they don't contribute to your pleasure, directly at least. "As the ultimate friction that they bring so much as your are imperfect, and prone to mistep at that, means that your path will become wobbled and diffuclt to reoirent. So theres reaosn in that sense." But, perhaps these hidden fears and apprhensions are a significant matter for how your commonly be, in that, of your wish to be generous, and social, so is a falsity in the framework of that libale to murky your actions in that: equal to how a falsity regarding the structure of yourself murkies your efforts there.
            <br>&emsp;Ultimnaely, there may be a private connection in all of this; in the sense that of our generosity, that it is somewhat done as concerns us. But at that, there seems more room to expand and consider, these layers as are prevalent in us. For the attention of things seemingly personal, may be things like these which have to do with others: and at that, the relation to ourselves may indeed be whats present, but wortwhile surely then.

            So, my theory of existence is balanced by several tenants. Foremost is the rule of discourse, and that because we are coming from a point prior to what is becoming known, and are likely incomplete in a final sense, so do we need the ability to give regards to entirety, but without any apprehension about the limits of our regards. Here, the notion of auxillary points come in. For instance, if two people are discussing what someone says, they likely are not considering the basis of language in their discussion. Even then, the rules of speech are not likely given regard either, but rather circumstantial information, and perhaps some common rules of converse. At that, beneath the relevant facts and conduct of the social realm, the auxillary point is what divides our remarks between the basis of that, and the fundementals of the elements in question. In a similar way, one may conclude that the formation of the universe and its structure is soley due to slight anistorpies in particle fields; and that of substance, there is merely the latter; while the auxillary point of this, is in regards to any baser mechanics and formation of the definite material, along with its ontological basis. In other words, auxillary points, albeit misplaced perhaps in the word, but in definition is fine, are to remove the common 'what abouts' within primary matters. For I do not know the basis of everything; yet, of the point right above such edge, I can say that the regards, for instance, of man's origin, is far derived from such primary layer, as is the case for most of the higher structuers we see.
            <br>&emsp;Besides that, we come to the core issue of material, and the distinction between aggregates and the real piece meal nature. Simply, nature, in a primary sense regarding material, is made of particles; and via baser laws, or the effects of other particles, so do certain accumulations occur. In this, we refer to the basis as the ultimate root of origins and constituency, while, placing an auxillary point of such quesiton, and refering to the piece meal view of the material as we effectively see, that of such material on that smaller basis, we say that our regards are of a finer sort; while those of aggregates are of something akin to a higher sort, in that of those finer elements, so are their aggregates merely concentrations of those. And at that we say that, ostenstively, they are derived. For although the basics of the laws are unknown, it is more or less understood that a soul particle will exhibit effects that are merely aggregated in the case of several particles. And to some extent, beyond magnifying the laws by some exponential factor, it is a fairly suitbale part of one's regard with respect to nature's complexion, to see that, akin to a fish in a sholl, that each fish is indeed acting, and exhibiting at that, as its own entity; and that only due to the clumping effects of the finer pieces, do larger, and perhaps more complicated effects occur: but souly as clumps of each particle's effect. Binding this, again with an auxillary point of the ontologiucal sort, but equally too of the baser laws which we'd think uself for our descriptions, is the well understood point that of the finest matter and its social origins, that the members of such clique were unevenly distribubted due to the slight differences of dark matter and radiation. Simply, as the substance of matter formed, so did the attachment of baryons with dark matter release some radiation; and, consequently, produced what is know as oscillations; and from these ripples came, as you'd imagine the space between two mountain peaks, pockets, where the solidfying matter would settle; and the distribution of these pockets was such, that where they were, and by whichever distirbutive degree, that so would matter accumulate as proprtionatley as the pockets secured. The auxillary point of origins, be it ontological in the purest sense, baser in the physical sense, or objective in the evident sense of the big bang, that so, in these pockets, was there an anistropic, or uniformly uneven dsitribution, whereby the accumulatio nof matter was slightly higher in certain spots, and at that held further accumulation -through gravity. This is the origins of galaxies, and at that the realms for stars, planets and all things they house.
            <br>&emsp;The final point builds on this process of structure, and simply remarks how such process is continuous, and at that consequent for any subsequent forms. Again, the origins of this process and the ingredients its composed of is unknown, and at that set for further discovery and inquiry: but our auxillary point stands: for if such source is contrived or reasonable, so is the existence which it procurred a continous one. Even if such existence was introduced in such a state, that of our trace back to it we concured that it did indeed go further, that even the we would still be right to ascertain the continuity from that introductory point: and at that the continuity of things moving forward. By my account this is the troubling tenant, for the proof of it is quite uncertain so long as our absolute basis of things is unknown. But indeed, I find that even the querkiest of theories don't contradict any evidence of constance. For evdience is indeed a reputable pivot to swing around, however incomplete its conclusions are. I just don't think theres any effect on the evidence beyond the depth of its understanding. At least, my grasp on the evidence, as nieve and lay it is, is only doubtfull of the lenght in which such evidence could reach back to, in the sense of origins. There is not but a glimpse of recognition in my mind, as to the possibility that nature, as it inscrutibaly appears, is in fact disspraportion in its otherwise seeming comparabilities; and at that, is not in unison, regarldess of the contrived or reasonable basis. I would like to say that things are continous, for much, if not all is explained, or accepted at least by the notion. But I cannot say for sure in a positive sense. And indeed that is fine, for I dont need to conclude the simplicity by which our humanity came to be. But I admittedly sense a sign of intelectual gratuity, in that, of such simplicity and its source from continuity, that of others who see the subject for explanation as different, besides the reasoning for it, so in that I see a inappropraite retreat from continuity; as such a tenant almost surely warrants and, albeit generally, explains the formation of the structures we now see: and at that validates what the structures are. Which is the tricky notion. For, in regards to our minds for instance, the shortcomings of this is such that our confusion about how the natural mind came to be is such as to permitt doubts of what the mind is. There is almost no good reasoning for what the mind is deemed otherwise; but our lack of understanding as to how the evident mind has become, gives way to antiquated views of the subject in question; and, admittedly, so merrit of the reasoning for that alternately described entity. 
        </div>
        <div id="contrived">
            When we think of the continuity of things, we see a process which offers predictive strenght, based on the events already procured. And, as we understand such events, we can further trace their origins. As if, 'hey, this is how this is working, and, hey! look at that over, it must be the cause'. Such insights bring our understanding into a state of harmony.
            <br>&emsp;But as we mentioned, there is this contrived possibility for things, in the sense that of a ball rolling down the hill, that so is it presumed to have come from a certain spot, and moved via the slope and gravity, accelerating at that; and at least from the point observed and its motion'd state, so can such a state be traced back; and recedingly to, as the point prior may be shown to have been the cause of the current, and so forth to the second priod point, which procurred the first prior; and, in some sense, has a lower origin, or baser one rather, of the higher moment. But, despite these events and or motions being consequences of prior causes, so is it possible that such causes were arbitrarily placed. And, from this, there is no real reason for such contrivance to be in one spot or the other; only, that in this sense, the introduction brought the object into a state of motion already. And of this contrived notion, there is a clearly faintness too it, for it offers little in terms of an explanation, as there is no discrimnate placement of the contrivance; and better yet, there is no proof of a contrivance, only a plausibility. Yet such plausibility works in any number of ways. As the point really, is that of the moment we now see, its state is reminiscent of a prior process; yet determining the existence of such line is plausibly arbitray, as by virtue of the contrived notion, any point of that line could have begun with that state of motion present; and at that progressed as what we now see.
            <br>&emsp;This may all seem quirky and strange; but without any definite reason as to why there cannot be such contrivance, its plausibility remains. Beyond this though, as regards continuity, we tend to think of our flow of things as congenial with all others, and at that, communal in the entirey of all things -forming a total realm. But, as if a snapshot of a coral reef and all its moving parts, that besides seeing the state of such a situation as derived from plausibly contrived points, that so may each point be differently contrived. How things come together is an immediate concern, but indeed, it could be that something was introduced with a brisk pace, sped up, slowed down, and at any rate retured to a level state of the process which led to our seemingly normal moment. In many ways the laws of physics are hard to exclaim, for their basis is not on anything but the faith in reason (or evidence). But how would one know, even if they understood the mechanics of light, that such a input from a source seemingly far away (by virtue of light's speed), that there was not some trick being played, and that the rules, or orderliness and natural fortuity, was awkwardly non linear and loopy: and at that, not so mechanistic in a progressive sense, but rather contrived and arbitrary. Or in other words, how do we know that our observations are not in fact but moments who suggest what, in a linear sense, would cause them, but in fact are due to but nearby moments of linearity, but otherwise loopily based in the prior, if not earliest stretches. Who has the reason to otherwise claim consistency? Is it perhaps the breadht of our register, or tally of evidence rather? Is it maybe the compatibility with all the current insights? For even if our understanding is wrong, and things are in fact loopy and contrived, can our current moment not be taken as if it were normal and natural? And at that, when we bring all the objects of this moment into one mingling observation, and we see that they are all inline with the process which we presume, does this not at least, for one, warrant a union of things within a state, however previoulsy contrived? And indeed, science may perhaps be what limits us from even doubting the constancy of our observations; for in our insight of the things which we are reckoning, so are our limits there not so permitting for awkward doubts; moreover, by further defininf what things are in a true identitive sense, so may the cause of our questioning be discerned, and at that cuurative of our otherwise baser doubts. But, indeed, the fairest reason, is a combination of the two, in that, of our identities, so may we not fully doubt less we know what the subject is which were doubting; and concurently, if we then knew enough to fairly doubt, or question at least, that part of the identity of the subject may inherently describe the mystery in question. And indeed, this sort of fullness to our inquiry marks a point where the leary doubts that otherwise hold their arbitrary head, loose their lustre and appeal, and at that begin to wilt like baked lettuce.

            Just as a steady heart makes threats and trouble deed like as compared to burdens, so is any expected harm or mistreatment of people equally so, that in a reasonable and levelled out way, is akin to the former and not so much the latter. As we like to say, severity is a scaling cause, and at that, prevalent in varying scenarios. But so are such events but a selection of many; and at that, home to their according consequences, be it peace or severity. And at any rate, regardless of the prevalance for these kind of events, and the outcome within them, that such results are akin to the pangs of deeds, and not those of burdens. This, is awkwardly diffiuclt, for our ease in seeing how things are, is so as only to be disgruntled and prone to certainty, if only to allievate the plausibility of 'a burdened mindset' and the gratuity which it assumes, and at that from our ignorance which permitts such thinness.
            <br>&emsp;I say this for our mind is such as to be free and set locally, and personally at that. For I make no claim that we are merely fine because our life is particualarly great, but rather because of all scenarios, so are set on a fair view of it. Which, indeed, is something easier to understand in unsevere situations: but the levellness is entire. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps the problem is that the leaks in our own life are not such as to require so much attention, that we in fact forgo other regards: as if our concerns are so clear and evident. Instead, we are in many ways tigthening loose knots, of screws which lie deeper than what is rightly apparent. This brings in some unease, as the far reaches of our life take on a precedent, beyond those of folk around, and their own surface level lives. Our motions are such as not to procurre a finer pace, and at that a flow of things which is beyond those minute self interests, and at that can be one with the pace of the broader world. Most worries and predictions fall beyond this, and become heated and apprhensive based on their forward bend. Which is not something I care for. Nor do I believe that most people act on these in any genuine way. But, in our overly reproached way, so does our ignorance of hwo the world is make way for those 'showy' views to seem more effective and actual then our fairer senses would suppose. Here is the source of our restless clarity, as if to remove the plausibility for our ignorant inflammations to take on any form.
            <br>&emsp;Within this broader outline, sits a relatively personal complex, one of which holds a good mixture of comfort and peace near its primary bounds. At that though, we seek to reconcile the reality in which were placed in. I think that occupation is such as to iron out our personal looseness, and at that bring us away from the overly tense and or scrupulous regards for the further space around us. This is better spent in curoisity, rather than relief. But our practical remarks are such, as to be, upon relfection, limited by our lack of friends, and effort at that. Since our amends find themselves bent on the prudent roots of our prior era, and the goods which such ways procure, so do we see our path forward as a dull one in a basic sense, but lush through the broader strokes of time. Indeed this can be weary, barren, and at that tense, as we feel the weight of our seperation. But here lies our wish to attend things; as our finer ability is quite attuned to notice what is actually relevant to our case, and at that the various degrees by which our minor ways produces apprehesnion.
            <br>&emsp;For starters, there is no anticipation by us to be rich or well received. And any concern of this not being so, is remedied by there being no need to prove ourselves; and our acceptence, personally and by family and friends, of our live progressing ordinalrily, and shining by our dearest regard, is rounding this out, as to remove any fear or apprhension of not being validated in such personal ways, nor our own reservations at removing anically struggles to such sincerity: for the limit of such, in many ways, is the diversion and tear that comes from seperate if not modifying efforts for the sake of validation. Our personal pace and its complexion becomes more varied, intricate, lush and colorfull; and at that, finds more ease in incorpoating the baser elements which our wish for praise and brillaince is staked on.
            <br>&emsp;Ultimately thoguh there is this leary point, and that has to do with our embrace of noramility, and the succession from our ideals, and the according world which we thought our valor would aid. This leaves us with a frettfull view of things; as if we saw chaos, but have lost the brevity to treat it, or our confidence and destiny at least. Painstakinlgy, we then try and describe the world accuratley, as to mend the lefover realm of our retreat. But the foot is before the shoe here, as our contrition is really  constricting our views, however fair they've become.

            It seems that our prior wish to see a brilliant end, is equal to our current sight of relations and public interest. One, however, is baked on a relinquish from self validation and glory. But I still wonder what draws us to have such a sight. Perhaps, in the way that school used to be, and work generally is, that the forthcoming of it is overhwelmingly evident, and unable to be ignored. While now, we are merely regarding a plausible, albeit likely, scenario, where we would then have something to attend.
            <br>&emsp;I think otherwise how our comforts are such, that of their worth we recede from; one reason being our permission to do so, the other of the good it will bring. A fair remark though, is that right now, for instance, I may simply be looking to relax, and at that enjoy something. Our time clearly is spent, and our position to be as we are somewhat trying to preserve, is not for the moment actionable. But this is different that regressing, where you nievly conform to seperate values; which via our disposion, never takes, or is of favor to me. 
            <br>&emsp;Theres just a mix you see. For our future is there, and with little which I'd describe solemly. But the prescence of it is neither demanding  or prominent. ANd for the most part this is fine, for we are not dissapointend with our lack of fantasy. But the flow of our day may seem inconstant. For, one side of it is in one of comfort, or a looser liberty that is. And, generally, this is accpetbale, in both our funds and leisure: as our studies come and go as they please, and for the most part require more patience than prudence. Durability is important, but polish is but a sparkle of our principle; and at that, our scenario is such as not to be in a consatnt shine. 
            <br>&emsp;There lies the problem though. And one which I cannot quite deinfe. It lies in our agreeability, and harmony, within comfort and its looser pace paired with the natural rise of our principles and interests; and at that, our finer peace in our normal surroundings, and that which we merrily see through the route ahead. This contentment is not so much of gratuity but amiability; for our pleasures in this case are mixed nicely with curisoity, leisure and self regard; but none of these wairs down the other; nor do they ask others to take a step back for the others sake. Yet, in this acceptence, there is this lingering state of the world and our place in it. And generally, this isnt a remorse of glory, nor a inflammatory guilt as to some imaginary worry, but rather a pang of seperation, and the illusory sparks this brings. The source though is that disconcernment, which  I can only say extends from the strands of us which are not so iroend out. There is no fear of no glory on my part; nor do I see our curisoity as being destined for or judged against recognition or scrutiny. It is merely our own, and a remark of our complexion as an ordinary man; whose actions are choosen as remarks his stature as being one, the invovlement of which merely shows such complexion by his mere prescence. 
            <br>&emsp;The heart of my thinking then, is so much as that route of me, and its fair and pastural pace amongst the million fibres and strands of the world, is such that so much as it is unrooted, hazily set, and in some sense confused, then its otherwise unobliged or unbravose intent will see it seperate from the world. Which is a reproach best described as idle, but due to a dragging from our ill clairty -as what remarks our appropraition to a finer ground of peace, calmness, steadyness, cheer and stability. "Why is this fine, by me and for me? As much as this is not known, so will we feel pinched between the irratbility of comforts aversion, and our non desire to hastily proceed. And why being is fair and pleasing shows our base pursuit."

        <div id="aggregatemarks">
            So our notion of positive response, is one of flavor, rather than a genuine distcintion of kind. The base of it is, that our sense are such, that foul odors are repellent, as are suspicoously colored fruits and flowers. But as the latter is honed on color, so is there a brilliance which can otherwise be seen; and at that, curry awe and grandeur. The source of this is a ancient one, and at that, seems somewhat unclear. As we can fairly attest to the systems which keep us alert from threats, and bring us to satiety; but why we first looked up at the stars is a real mystery.
            <br>&emsp;We can say though, that for whichever reason, we are still, in our freedoms, drawn. For I feel no threat of starvation or predator; yet am still awry when we aren't doing something. Tradtion may hold our bow here, as she keeps us in check for whats important. But for me, this influence his never been thoughtfull, and of a disciplinary sort. For none of it is banked on what we need, but rather what we are contempable, or ill oppertune, not to get. In many ways wisdom is the retreat from such givens, and otherwise a dissolving into the evident worries and needs; as if one could tell me my hand was hurt when it felt not. And, via or curisoity, as a comparison to the religious impulse, and our general means of removing worry and fortifying our strenght (as a brace and a promise from clarity), we discrimiate and inquire, as not only to live more freely and without concern due to an abscence of evident threat, but more deliberatley explore and define how things are beyond that. Indeed, this may remark finer motions within us, and at that the interarctions we have with folks close to us and the general culture around, but so in that, merritable or not, we find a more reputable truth; as our actions are not only reproached from presumption, but approaching something solid instead.
            <br>&emsp;In a way, this is merely a religous impulse moulder by self regard, rather than tradtion. And indeed, there is little superstition or neccessity which colors our according way. Yet, as all  religions, there source seems to be an awkward remedy of our isolation. For, indeed, tradtion may bolster the efforts of surrounding men, and thus the flow of our own possible motions; and similarly, this flow may be garnered by a lack of self regard and curiosity in men who may not even be so staked in tradtion, but are rather lifeless instead. I find this circumstance the strangest of all; for its profits are such, that being so open to the breadht of nature, so is there a merritable scope to the consquent inquires, and at that a source for brevity and confidence. For indeed, this impulse to secure a truth is in many ways a wish to settle your solitude: which we simply say is the grounds for non-tradition and inquiry. But in our natural strenght which comes from this, so does it tend to lean to far, and become in oppistion to the antiquated notions prevalent. 
            <br>&emsp;But this, as I truly believe, is a result of continuity, and the developments that the constance time brings. For none who have ever inquired, did so outside the common realm; and at that were made somewhat seperate by virute of their non-conformity, and espcially so as the seperation was not merely of aversion, but cultivation -and its favored placed of a working environemnt. And weirdly there are hopes from all in this sort to bring others on board, as the world seems so heavy on their shoulders. Nor, does their lack of cohersion with the common norm make such norms seem foreign and dissarayed; which, like Montainge, breathes much rancour. 
            <br>&emsp;I say we are nearly modern, for the querries of science have still not yeilded us a resolvable truth, as all prior speculative attemmpts have. This current era of inquiry is a vast and discriminate one, but holds no binding beyond its rural ontology. There is still a seclusion to its merrits, and at that lacks much description and practical cohersion. That, and the eshecatology and or meaning behind it all, is such, that warranted in the question, or at least insightfull to what those ancient questions were sourced from, so has our current state offered little solidity.
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps, this is the ease by which we consider the strenght of things, and our ability to wonder and postulate, sourced from our liberty to inquire. And such a line, as it continues itself and solidifes, almost becomes inseperable from the world which we are otherwise inquiring against. As if, all were in a cave, and we instead stood outside, truly seeing. As our sights have gone from suggestion, to form, to reason, and passed even the unruling strenghts of that cavish pedantty, so do walls and aridity of the cavern become inseperable from the world as we truly see. It is not some vista which our place on the ledge is privy to, but rather a proper assimilation of the geogpraphy and reason of which all are part of. This is not even a bold claim by the purest of reason. 
            <br>&emsp;Normally, we would see things differently, and being so drawn, we'd wish to marshal such a portrayal against others: as if it were some argument. One of the rules though of inquiry, is that beyond the validity of explaining the means by which we know, that of what we knew, broadly speaking at least, is soul, set, invariable; and that, indeed, it is the distincction of the recieving instrument which may correspond to different impressions, or responses at that; but from objects which are not, in truth different. Better said, that nature has a way, and is as such in one soul sense. In a scholarly sense, and by the breifest of defintions, pluarlity and monisn accordingly contradict. What we are regarding may render these terms obsolete; but so, even then, of what we regarding and in which sense, so is there a soul entity to the thing in question. 
            <br>&emsp;As we've stated, regarding atoms for instance as entities is all too hollow, as it is merely a bundle of real entities, and as such is not some entity itself. In other words, our identity of thing, may be nominal or of things derived, but is indeed absolute without regards for the latter. And by this, our sense of regard is baked with speculative ingrediants that suitably exhibit the grooves of our question. Namely, describing galaxies for instance and their formation of planets, is not a base question, but a configured one; as such motions are merely aggreates of finer elements. At that, our remarks of such basics is accordinly such, as are our aggregate regards. But so, in our understanding of the principle of things, can we see, how in unison and commradery, that their aggregacy formed the complexes we derivately see. And by that, such distcintion as aggregates and basics would be somewhat unneccassry; for the limits of the latter would not require a proprortionate approach for aggregates; in the sense that as the basics are unknown, then so is the core of the aggregates also; yet in those we still wish to attend; and as we are inquiring to the basics, so may we inquire to the aggregates, but with the sense that our remarks are not principially certain. But when those basics are known, then we need no leniant regards for aggregates, but rather a means of describing how the known basics aggregate. "At that point, such aggregates are, in origin and consitnecy, known on the level of those basics; and, to reiterate, require less presumption in their own effective discourse." 
            <br>&emsp;My point, is that perhaps our inquiry has led to a deeper truth, and at that affords me a leary mix of prospect, obligation, and admittedly confusion

        <div id="beyondreluctance">
            So I know with a fair degree of precision, why I became so self attended. Only now, I am not, nor have I ever really been, so sure as to what such an attunement means. For, commonly, two aspects come to play, namely that of changing the world as to remedy your solitude, or validating yourself be prooving the reason for simplicity, or finding prospects to it, as to more peacefully, and cohabitatively, exist in such a personal way.
            <br>&emsp;In many ways, our abscence from the core of duty, saw little incorparation with the common good around it. And even as our adjustment into our self saw much aversion into working in any common way, so did our ultimate assimilation to it not conjure with it the goods which normally come with it. There were indeed wishes of the normal sort, be it of relations or aspiration. But so, in the everdyay swings of comfort and fun, so were were either averse of unintrigued.
            <br>&emsp;At that, our core of self regard is strange, and indeed is till working itself out. But as to remedy this inclosuvie state, ought we give some regards as to the priotrity of it in the first place. For, my life was such, that our unengagment with any of the traditions placed upon me, saw a relativley high recourse into ourself. Rather than one who was involved, but looked inwards as to find some fufillment, I had none the former, and thus fell fully into the latter. And by this, the merrits of being so self regarded, saw the goods of it root themselves in as our backbone of wishes and respect. And at that, so did any lingering needs of duty acclimizatie themselves with respect to the evdident needs that our core life required. And at that, such a life became the pasture for all coming harvests; no matter the postion or place amdist the common affairs, this never pulled me away, nor swindled me into looking past their ill-fitting for our true interests.
            <br>&emsp;At that, our life has come to be. But indeed the course of it seems off, for we are in most ways shedding the last layer of reluctant ambition and desire, and accordingly settling into our life as it really is, and forging it as to remain as such, and with a growth that can only be described as local and natural. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps there is a simple strangeness to our time, in that the forced amends which our limits drug out from us, hold no more sway. But accordingly we have no amends. And our time is such, that the plainer commitments which we could ripefull seek, are not but a future prospect. And this crevace of simplicity and future activity has me lingering. 
            <br>&emsp;I would say though, that our retreat from over-ambition and expected glory, is too early as to remove you from seeing the future equally. The form of it is different, but are regards for there being a future there still remains; and we simply fill it with fairer elements, as opposed to those which are adolescent. But the future still remains, and at that, so much as such future is deemed, seems but forthcoming, and currently unactiomable. At least prior our ambition was growing, however prior to any defininte position. What I would say, is that the pressure to be so future oriented, left with it a sort of impression and remark when such future regards  left. At least, as the force of our future regards left their grander sort, and our amends were merely of a more simple and public kind, so did the frame of the world which contorted around that broader future view, stay as a sort of implant, when the substance which inflated it left. At that, our milder future remarks seem tense, as the substance, however fair, is not near enough for the prior frame to seem full. And the point is not that our current substance needs inflattion, but rather that it would be close, as there to be substance at all. Indeed, our worldview as remarked our inflated sense of purpose and place, is fine to deflate a little and relax. But the nature of it is such, that of its size it was according to the inflated regard for the future; and as that has brought a substance which equates to a lesser view of the future, so does that leftover sense have little to settle on. At any rate, the pressure is of a balanced sort, whereby the current substance seeks more brevity, or wishes to be met sooner, as to increase its relevance, and anticipatory effect. 
            <br>&emsp;What I am thinking, is that rest is what we need, as to settle into our newer form, whereby the world is seen as it is with respect to our unbravose and far minded way. The future we do see is in most ways closer, but far in a dense sort -by virtue of the immediacy which our less stretched life brings. From this, I would say, that your health marks the vector for constancy, and resituating at that. Of this, regression is the main problem. Principle may change, as can moments cause a decrease in magnitude. But our course remains forward and accordingly bent.

        <div id="ofnature">
            It is quite easy to outline a basis for nature. Except, when we then wish to describe the structure of it, or arrangments rather, we realize that our theory is wrong, or premature at that. 
            <br>&emsp;By virtue of our inquiry, and the encumbant approach from not knowing, the identity of things which we'd deem as outputs of nature comes short, as much as that basis of nature is wrong. For indeed, there is no true planet or rock, but the clumpnig of particles; which are themselves the ebbings of basic fields. And in that, our own ignornace of facts and observation make our inquiry somewhat limited. And at that I would be best to refine. But I can say, for the moment, that our notion of nature's basis is such, as to balance the proportions of what we presume it would be, in a conceptual sense, and that of which it is the basis for. As such products in many ways indicate the finer workings which bore them, and at that offer an insight to their source. But so musn't we confuse, or presume, that a certain layer of material is the basis; at least, such material ought to explain the parameters which remark our basic inquiry. "How did such matter come to be, and however substantial, how did it begin to interact, or move at that and procure the aggregates present." In other words, how has a figure, or form rather, of nature and its complexion changed, but of a mere configuration of those baser pieces: what brought them to this point, and are the means to it rational, in that they are understandable, or are they contrived, in that the conduct of such material is ingrained to the core of its principality. In many ways, I believe that this latter notion is pure. Yet, it remains a doubtfull position so long as we are unable to fully make it. Simply, of the events, or evidence, which we deem a product of that mysterious source, that if such subjects are not in fact complete, enduring, or anything but a weaving of some baser assortment, whose conduct is such that it reflects a ontology which can only be describe as 'whithering', then so does the question become one, still, of its means of anisotropy, as to create non-uniform complexity; and, secondly, and foremost, that of the nature which our evidence appears, but is in fact as nature'd as the elements its composed of, how can such fundementals be in such a way, as not to correspond with the apparent conduct of the arrangments which we are privy too? 
            <br>&emsp;For starters, we must remove the nievity of our senses, and the presumption that our observations are anything but higher orders of complexity; and at that, reflective themselves of the objects which they see: but in that, equally unrefined in their principality. Language is a mere remark of signs, and the basis for sounds and perception are not much more than a developing course of nerves and preperation. Beyond our actual anthropic mixture, so are we inquiring, and at that, free to overstep what is otherwise universal and total. Our apprhension reflects a grander mystery, akin to someone struggling to open a coconut; which, as an act, is not much more than a complicate form of chemical reaction. "Like a plant being drawn up towards the sun." 
            <br>&emsp;The point, is that our regard for existence is not so seperate from our state of thinking. And at that, so is such a state, as was once thought, some special form of existence: like a earthly comparions of divine sight. This is folly, and in many ways comes from an inappropriate character within the act of total inquiry. For such an act is best when it is without prejudice to our actual concnern; which is to say, that our ignornace of things less clear then the operation of opening a coconut is overhwlmig, and at that, a source for our heuristic superstitions and nievety. Our fear of not being special, or seperate from the rocks we stand on, is but a momentary relief, as the currents of nature press on. And, as a rock's nature is unclear so much as nature's basis is too, so is our means of inquiring a mere arrangment of that nature, like the rock; and the confusion of us being special is no more than us missatributing our speculation, and such complexiry, for what is really just language; which is, itself, millions of years of progression from the mere chirps of a Capuchin -or the howling of, well. Such acts are not so unique, as are plants not much more, clearly, than the offspring of a different lane of chemisty. But chemical no less. 
            <br>&emsp;And in many ways our troubles come from a lack of inquiry. Which is to say, a proper conduct in our speculative approach, in that we don't fail to ask questions by virtue of their contrariety to observation, nor do we forbid questioning based on prior speculation. The current of nature is all we seek to know, for what will happen, and conseuqnetly our place in it, is contained within that. But nature is indeed constant, at least the complexion of it which we inspect, is of a forward motion: hence the flow, and our wish to know our place on it. But so must our regards respect this fact; as, special or not, we are trying to describe something which appears only to be moving; and at that, our maturity to this state, brings our own inquiry as a kind of relfection, or mirror if you will, of that flow, whereby we are merely a responding strand. If only by language and our according response, we wished to seize the current, and remedy our anxious response. 
            <br>&emsp;Accepting otherwise, that our nature is such as to be part of nature as you have only a the fair right to believe, is such as to remove you from superstition and accompanying conlcisions, and otherwise settle into the simplcity of the mortal issue which spurrs you to be otherwise pernicous. And in such acceptence, we are akin to a prisoner who has foound peace in their place, but still wishes to understand the walls around them. Indeed, this is the trickiest of notions, for our liberty to see and explore is but a propsed state of character upon the banishment of fear. But the merrit of not being afraid is not complete, and at that our ease in being unafraid seems hazy. But I would say, overall, that if we remove the presumptions which come from false conclusions, and at that recede from the motives which were at their core bare, we may actually be in this more lively and vital state, and therefore further our understanding to a profitable degree, or at least be at peace while our mere place in nature is present, until we dissolve into the later ebbs of its current. 
            <br>&emsp;The source of this fact is purely developmental. And, not be exact, but consider if all were told a lie, and disposed themselves to the concliusions according to that; at some point or the ohter, which is the part I cannot say, if someone saw otherwise, as perhpas the truth in things eventuall overhwlems you with its prescence -by virtue of its complexion being actuall lso- then someone being privy to that would only take them to unexplored realms, as nonoe have so far seen it. This is the path to modernity surely, and has been a communal sort of a literary sort, as the true insights of folk was insightfull to those in times far to come. 
            <br>&emsp;My point, is that the questioning of nature is such, that holding things sacred, and namely of ancient gains, is such as not to remark much truth; as, indeed, whatever the truth is, it is drawn from the currents of nature, and her soul complexion. And past knowledge is, fairly, a verification of that; but is surely not anything but. For my impression now, however sifted, is of nature and her soul way; and beyond guidance and direction, so can I see the truth as anyone ever saw it. "While errors and fallacy are nearly unbounded in their complexions." In some sense my points are such as remark the known apprhensions, and the beliefs which have followed. But, besides arguging for that, I merely inquire; relatebly, as our body is fated for an end as all others have passed, and like those who will nearby. But I only say then, that what is relevant to me, is such that it comes from nature's appearence, and how that complexion appears. This then, is the point of specifics, and the adolescent approach of mixing our insight with prior inquiry. But it is a soul one, as remarks the soul nature were attending. And as all projects avail, so are the properties, or techniques of merrit, apparent by their progress: and harmony with the soul of nature seems the right metric.
        </div>
        <div id="domainofman">
            Our permitt of inquiry comes from a strenght whose origins I have but little explored. I can say, fairly, that it is but a process of time amidst the rest of things, and at that, marks how our inquiries have led to definite views. And ultimatley, there appears no reason why our minds are anything but a part of nature, as rocks; and that, peculiarly, their conduct is such, that their motions are responsaive like a tree is to light; or the mere neurology which causes an averse reaction from an animalas hand to a flame. All else is but a process of that arrangment, and the mecha of language which has led to modernity. But so is there not a mind, so to speak, any more than there is a heartbeat, or adrenaline.This, not seeming so special, are but the weavings of finer matter. And the point, is that if that finer matter is such, in a existent way, then so is everything else equally so; and our repute as to the complexion of our minds, and its enduring composition, fails via the mistaken stance on our mind; and at that, without such a stubborn appeal, the true nature of our suspicion of objects being equal to the existent pieces which form them, becomes clear. For our senses, are much higher then the basic pieces which, in their existence, be accordingly, but in ways that objects apprear to our senses. Namely, that they are seperate from one another, filled out [the error of opaqueness] and, foremost, that they are present, and at that continuous. But this indeed is a false remark, and primitive at that, of how things really are. And perhaps, as in most cases, development ins our liberal key; for none truly despire what things are, only their mysteries; and, at that, the conviction of what appears conlcusive: for it not being otherwise means a mystery which is so difficult to hold. "Let me know, give me wisdom, so my thinking and reproach may be done." For, in the continuity of nature,  so lies the incorporation of fallacy, and its eventural break. The reformation, for instance, is a example of this, and so much more similarly to come. And from this I see the complexion of real insight, that of our senses and their conceptions, that such impressions are fairly false, in the way that our behaviour has led to superstistion. But as such falsity is but a temporary state, as the truth in nature holds the finest rays, so does real insight occur, and progress accordingly. 
            <br>&emsp;And it is my view that our idea of entities are such, as not to remark what they are, but a higher order basis, via our senses. For instance, our sight is not so continous, as it is both, in the image, a compositition of granular inputs, and at that creates an equally granular image. And, effectively as this speckled view seems composite, or together, so are the impressions we get of all other things equally unreal. And, indeed, it is a mixture of science and its insights of the finer fabrics of nature -ie. the speckled truth in things- and our inquiry as to identify and describe the proportions and basis for such things, mixes together as to form an understanding of things, which is complete enough as to soothe our ultimate suspense, but not so absolute, as to be but temporily so, but in fact be vain, as our certainty was full of flaws and nievity. 
            <br>&emsp;And, indeed, here lies the harshest of things. For much imagery has been mistaken as truth, and our resolutions accordingly. But of what really matters, namely our own existence, so does the truth in that and the extent of knowledge required to be sure, is more than not simpler and prior to anything along absolute minds. "For indeed the neccessity of such an understanding being so, is in apprhensions which come from false identities and bare inquiries: and such is the reason why modernity is the coming hope: for the past, is not but a tense and stubborn storm: for nature need not be so migthily held, but rather submitted to." And to what, is her given hand: and to which end? one which is good, so long as your dance with her, is steady, pure and complete. And indeed, the marker then for what is true as pertains us, is when such qualities are present; for our steps must surely be best. And at that, so ought we merely dance, and measure ourselves by our disposal to that: and sin is indeed all that which causes a stiff hand, or a weight to toes.
            <br>&emsp;My point, is that the way nature is and how our impressions seem, is not aligned; and that of the latter, their holds no merrit; escpially when the remedying insight of science and precise inquiry show us that such  reality is in fact no as our sense seem. Of these accuracte insights, so ought they be learned to a full degree; for our aim then, is to question the basis for such things, while avoiding contrivance: for such proposals are like cushions to existence. Moreover, our mind is not a privilaged thing, but a limited lens by which nature is seen, and at that affords little sanctity. In fact, dealing with what is sacred can be done by offering the mere statement: of nature, in that she is whole and entire, so to that ought we invesitage reputably, and upon insight amend. Who is not doing this anyway. It only seems that such integrity to the truth brings contrary notions to what others believed otherwise. But remaining devout to such insights is quite stubborn, and admitts of no progress; which, in fact, marks a lack of care for the credibility of the basis for belief; as, those which once were held merrit only as much as their basis was credible: and surely a development from that basis affords an update of beliefs? Besides this stubborness, there is often an appeal to earlier reasoning; which in many ways says that the current proposals are wrong, as that which was suggested prior is more merritbale. Yet, this appeal is usually baked in loose impressions and concepts that run beyond the level of evidence; and at that appeal to the grandeur and brevity of miracles and revelation. What do these offer if not evidence? And if evidence is deemed unneccaaty, as the intervention of signs and offerings require no judgement but honor. Evidence is not treated so differently, for in that, so are we recieving signs, and submitting to them. The question then, as to the register in which certain signs are admitted as being clear for submission, is to the credibility of such signs, and whether they in fact are as they are attributed. Judgement and amends is one thing; by in terms of our assessment of the subjects for judgement, or facts namely, so is the perrenial split between supernatural and natural the real divide of our regards. For all things being of the latter really amount to a more complex and united picture. While the elements of the former seem somewhat true in a personal, if not local sense. For a man in China sees the natural complexion of the stars as a man does in Texas. Yet, a tribe in fiji sees the divine in different ways than those in Mumbai. Nor, in the supernatural case, so much as we are talking about particular signs within it, and at that ignoring the plausibility for intervention to begin, that of such superntural signs, that they must be amidst natural ones. If an auger spots a bird, and sees a pattern to his flight worth admitting, does he still not see the sun, the sky, the clouds; and is he still not privy to the natural scents and sounds around him. That is why they call it supernatural, because it is something amidst other things which are natural. It would not be so super otherwise. and the point, is that in this complex of super and fully natural signs, so is their a host of weakness and contrarity when it comes to those former. And of the latter, there is a eveness and vastness to all things invovled; moreover, do they loose nothing if those supernatural remarks are ignored. And, at that,  the basis for such supernaturl remarks, when verified, seem somewhat illusory and false: at least, their plausibility within existnece, so much as our natural extent implores, is unwelcomed, unable, and at that, unevident based on the abscence of any effects of that sort. "For nature has a mingling way, whereby her hues and flow mix together; and like light, bounce off eachother: and indeed, the likely cause of an intorduced strand or stroke, is such, as to be ceratin way and accordingly exhibit its effect on all the other common stripes: and there is no evidence of that." And, at any rate, it would seem that our reservation in accepting this natural state, and ignoring the falsities prescribed, is in so much as it feels important to us. Which indeed seems insincere when it comes to the nature of things: for your acceptence of that is almost strictly an appeal to preference, rather than truth. But, the real issue, as I see, lies in the roots of what has us averse to being unsure. And all the flawed attempts, at least as much as their findings were sacredly held, are such as to be like a child who has not learned his lesson, and is feeling the effects of his ineffectivness. The world has not changed, nor our place amongst it. But we were merely gunked up from the primitive stretch of our human flow. But modernity is coming, nearly. As Socrates died easily, like the Barbarians spilled threw, how the renaiisance could not be stopped, and enlightenment at that, so is our time leaving its primitive state. But the issue for man moving forward is not so much that he has now won: for indeed the delusion that he had prior, was almost souly in the fact that he felt he had, rather than the quality of his attempt. For the core speck of wisdom which always prevails, is surrender, submitt. For nature will then clearly be seen, and increasingly so, in its complexion, and your respectfull amends. I, saw not but air as a boy, and at that, anwsered only to what I was asked; and indeed, propiety and our limit glowed quite clearly: but so, our path lies, on  route filled with  cheer, to such agreed upon end.

            It seems that our reservations lie in the information age were part of, in that every person is at liberty to view a moutain of products and scenery, and at that, has a more or less personal view of things.
            <br>&emsp;Normally, the worry is that such variety of impressions will yeild to weakness and delusion. But our own idea of how they are so impressed is quite limited, and at that, worth reproaching from. All that seems to matter then, is formats of expression which remark upon this modern fact: and do so to an inflammatory and worrying degree, as they take the variety of impressions at face value, and think others so thinnly subject to them. A strong technique to overcome this apprhension, is in the mystery of other people who see that such people are making concerned expressions; and at that, from our point of view, do such people who see others worried, really impact them. In some sense, the core of our reproach is in the likely eveness by which the mountain of impressions come into folk, but ultiamtely holds no effect beyond that which integrates with the more significant and relevant stpes of their actual lives. And, equally, that of T.V and its edge of futility, so does such impression from others, be it in what they learn, or how they fear others are learning, so is such an intake as impactfull as it is relevant to their actual lives. For even my grandparents, who have contemporay convictions and attitudes regarding politics, more or less hold their tongue, less it comes up in discussion; and even then, it is indeed a discoure of frustration, in that the outcome and affiars of the subject are not either attended to or so whoelsomely concnerned, but how other people view things. But this indeed is a frantic characteristic, as the course of everyones days and lives are such that most of it is not bent by the information they recive: especially that which is potentially, or ultimtaley even, hollow. There is this venere on tevlesion which makes it seem more impressionable; and this is why theres not much of a fear of folk reading twitter, for its minutia is not seemingly overhwleming: and so much as it is, it is moreso of the drain on the user. Which is indeed the point, that of these things, our lives remain, and only that which is usefull is integrated. And those who become grogged down, or get spazic, are somewhat like ordinary folk with a sickness: and who ever made much of a difference with that?
            <br>&emsp;I would say, overall, that the breadht of the world is more or less flattened out by the noramility in things, and that akin to junk food, so is our choice in attnetion and effort the mitigating factor for our life's quality. And by that, all this abundacne of inofrmation is not much more than pollen floating in the air: and, as a compliment to the fruitfull grooves which feed our lives, abundantly. 
            <br>&emsp;From this, I can only say, that our curiosity and its effective complexion, is all that really concerns me; and indeed, a normal life is all anyone really seeks, and but of a colored or passioned kind as the wairs of the present reflect. But I only  mean then, that of such tears, that our life otherwise is quite ordinary, and, most importantly, subject to the baser laws which govern the good in our life. The impetus for knoweldge it seems is not so much in alleviating our personl worries, as an abandoment of tradition and non-inquiry does not leave one with any principal threat. Of our life though, in how it is good, so does the abandonment of others feel promeint, and at that, a heightened sense of their turmoil. I'd say, develomentally, that our attaintment of the good life has come from a seperation from other's common flow of things; and at that, we lack much insight to how others really are, to the effect that our own sympathies can rest, in a humble way. For everyone's life is the same, and be it a circumstantial moment of crimenad villany, or the mere degradation of living in less quality home or state, so are these, as much as we are a person amidst our own known brehteren, issues and cares beyond our heartfelt reach: and the pangs which seathe otherwise are more akin to inflammations of a cluttered mind.

        <div id="thebestliving">
            The basis for health, in aim, is to procure the good life, its base at  least; while the actual mean of it, or conduct, is in all things, with respect to proportion, for consistency sake. Since we have an aim, the faciliation of it, so much as health is concerned, is a fairly explicity measure of how well, in terms of health in this case, it is doing to faciliate that. And in other words, the propiety of our efforts which, with respect to health, bring out the according basis for good living, is so, as much as the proportions which bring out such end, do so with regularity, simplicity and ease: and our own self regard, or personal assessment, is so, as much as our strict and or complimentary efforts (to health) are effective, or fruitfull at least, to the propoprtions which our aim (so much as helahtp procures it) requires. And, at that, of the constancy which our aim needs the complexion of our health to be, then so will our efforts which procure such mean, be judged equally of their merrits, so much as they produce the constancy of health and, accordingly, the good life which such development brings.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the good life is composed of many things. But, generally, the heart of it lies in action. For, indeed, whether we are aspiring to something, maintaing something, or enjoying something, so are we involved with action. And at any rate, it seems less relevant that our remarks as to what we have, bear any significance beyond the actual living which is done; and, generally, regarding things outside such possive remarks, seems much closer to the heart of the matter, being activity. As such, this life which we deem good is so, because it has good elements. But, the good that we have, is of our life, and at that the commplexion of such life; which, for consistency sake, is always moving, is subject to injury and oblige, and holds a neccessary limit at that. This is why indulgence and glory and futile goods, as their worth holds little weight in the actual course of our life, but in made up ones instead;  at least, if our composure is of an uneven sort, then we may be prone to passion, gratuity and over expression; but these indeed, with their according goods, remark an expereince whose strucutre is inflammed and weary, or overly tuned in awkward ways. Such is not our life and how, within our natural complexion, it is. By this token, the good we seek is from that genuine place of living. "while the good of someone who is encaged or enraged, is so as to remark an expereince born of an uneven life: while our goods are such as to reflect the fullest conmplexion of life."
            <br>&emsp;For whichever reason, this fairer view of living, is such as to be composed entirely of action, and at that, our goods come from procurring action of the greatest sort; in the sense that irritable action is with less favor than peacefull ones; and the funnest expereince is worth less as a moment, than a semester of wholesome study. 
            <br>&emsp;My feeling then, is that if such good life is found in actual living, or action so to speak, then the means by which we bring such living will be approrpiately such, that their output is of actions which truly are good, and not of a lesser sort. For we are always acting, in labor, peace, freedom and lust. But procurring the richest complex of these expereinces is such, that of their composition, so are they the richest when their arrangment is fit to the strucutre of life (in its fairest way); and accordingly, so our means are judged against. For, I need no motivation to look up and see the stars, to enjoy writing or the taste of sugar. Each of these though, come to us by different means; and although our expereince may be encumbant, and at that is limited merely by the scenario provided, so does our wisdom lay in what we actual provide. For our wish for food is innate, and a driving facotr for our search of food. But whereas the satiety of that is met when food is obtained, it is not too clear how the felicity of writing is acquired; and, at that, how it balances its requirment with proportions of other actions. For sugar is good indeed, as its taste brings us comfort and ease. But upon doing so, our mind is a little lazy, as is our heart and bones a little soft and unengaged. Writing surely doesn't come along from this; at least, as much as it does, so is the proportion of it less so, and of a fainter sort. This indeed is the inquiry of good living; for an abundance of one expereince restrticcts another, or it may be a compliment. And it is one thing to say what effects certain things have, and another to say what outcome is most desired. For the former comes through pure reflection, and deliberation at that upon the findings. While a mixture of simple reasoning, perrenial wisdom and basic truths (through inquiry), lay out the ground in which our nature stands, and by that, seeing who we are, and whereabouts, what composition would remark the greatest expereince: or compliments of actions which brought us the qualities reminsicent of such an expereince. And although one may be ingrained with relfection, like Montainge, or inbided with baser insights, like Plutarch and Epitetus. But there is none who can tell you, so frankly and adept, what marks the color and hue of the best expereince, the complexion and haze of truly good living. For these are indeed maxims, and given at that. But as for what they afford, so is it an operation to the mightiest degree. And the mark of a man, surely, is in being so indebted to the excellence born upon this, that their assumptions are held up by the virtue of inquiry, and its undemanding posture. Who could ever fault a man who thought that kindness and prudence were the mark of his entirety? What assumptions that this complexion bore from, was worth any scrutiny? The frontiers of this are perhaps unknown, and at warzone for those stuck in the sanctity of the paast, and the pedantry oeven of those so contempiraily learned, but unexpereinced with any kind of real living. "INquiry then is not a claim, but our deepest reflex away from the fires of our expereinced non-good living." And who can tell me the basis for all, in God or quanta: and at that, the truth in our actual reflex away from a flame: "for is that action not contained within all, and at that a mystery utlaimtely, so much as the basis for it is unknown? Yet our hand still moveth, and bears credible reference at that. To which I equally inquire regarding the heat and posterity of our everyday living."

            As in all things, defining the goal is ultimate, for all things are but a mean. And by that, our life is such, that of its best, so is it so as per the quality of our time, or experience. In that, we have both the strucutre of our life and its core truths, and the color so to speak, which we use, are are reminiscent of, in how such a figure is saturated. 
            <br>&emsp;This latter is the crucial strand, as the former is but a general construct of an undeniable sort, varying only in the degree to which you angle such a form -ie. our core nature and that of life. But so much as our complexion remarks, so is this best, in a flavorfull sense, when the tambre, so to speak, is not too firm, nor to soft, has a width which is encompassing, ample and broad, but not overly extended, nor too condensed and rigged. In a word, there ought be a richness which inebriates our heart and bones, and of that well placed and spaced sort. And at that, we would want this felicity as often as possible, and to the point where the bulk of the expereince was of the plumpest sort. Indeed rest will come, as will duty take our attnetions elsehwere: but so for this goal, in terms of a quality which best describes any good in our expereince, and one which becomes familiar to us in an innate and deeper way.
            <br>&emsp;As the core of our knot, so may be wind, and at that specify certain dynamics. For one, thinking of sex or literal sweetness, we have concentrated goods, in that their richness is in their density, not duration. This compares to the evening glow that one's mature sight can take hold of, and lastingly munch on; or, as a personal favorite, the very prominence of the moon, and our pleasure in seeing it accompany us through the day (as it goes through its own set and rise). 
            <br>&emsp;In a word, total, marks the strictess hue of our expereince, in that sex, for instance, is of the deepest reds, but holds relatively little volume; indeed it is more volumous than something like a donut, whose pleasure extends 5 minutes, but so is such an orgasm less extensive than a day at the beach for instance. The scale is there obvious. But so must we remark lingering effects, in both drowning and pleasing ways. For sex, albeit of a moment or so, or something akin to a t.v show, is quite composing through the rest of the time following; be it the feeling of accomplishment, or the pure physical ease, so is there a lingering radiance of satiety. Which is something tthat food expereinces reguarly, in that being full is a lingering compactness; and, at that, of a varying slate of solidity, in that a donut, for example, may leave a lingering dullness and indolence, while a salad seeps you comfortably into your composure, and holds you their with tender hold. 
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, anticipation is a sort of precusor, and a lingering approach at at that: as the hues of the forseen experience are but beginning to drip, but have not yet swashes over you. And indeed sex has this seeping potential, nor is the delight of a coming meal something uncommon. But, I ask you, how much value do we assign these lingering effects? For, comparably, is there more worth in a explicit moment of joy, which is both approached and followed by an eveness of  comfort, or a long duration of ebbing fortuity, whereby you rest with both brimmness and cheer, and, with frequency and grace, periodiclaly peak into moments of prominence and acuity, and expreince a sort of regular swiftness and fecundity? How do these genuinely reflect one another, and is the concentrated peak of one more desirable than volume of the other? It is hard to say admittedly, for the comparioson is very much in a vaccum. And, at least for me, the latter is indeed my preference, as the former instance is literally a momenatry slice of purity, no matter the lingering, while the latter layout is one of extended richness of a wholesome kind. 
            <br>&emsp;I would say that these qualities are but factors which we deem prinicipal, and at that the basis for our calibrarory regard. And, in being so, the complexity and v  ariation which most things are reminsicent of, holds some standard, if not basic strands which to act pecilalry from. As indeed, in the case of food, a great dinner may only be so for the tastiness it affords, but exhibit not but a luggard density to the pleasure and peace through the rest of the day. And when we compare this to a fresher meal, who is perhaps more timely and deliberate, that despite the more evened out remains of the day, that so is there the ineveitbale need for sleep and breach into the morning to come; and at that, beyond the actual impact to the period your in, so is the degrading of a subseuqent one genuinely dim. As beyond the perils of friction and its nagging effects on momentum, so are you literally achieving a flatter stretch of time beyond the one which followed the meal at hand. For we all sleep, and the hours before hold no irrelevance in how its impacted. And so, beyond the quality of your night, so is the root of the coming day connected, and at that a primary concern. For if we actually extend our thinking into the basic effects of momentum, so will the time leading up to the next days meal be impacted by the quality of your morning and afternoon. Just considering exerrvise and your other eating choices, how are those encouraged or pulled against by the grudgeries of the previous night: and at that, what angling effect do they have on next days dinner, where it is more open for you to further engage in begruderry, nor as smooth and effective in your prudent choice. 
            <br>&emsp;Indeed the complexion of things demands secondary principles, for the basisc of consistency and richness are not enough in their principal sense; especially when we bring in multiple factors whose judgment requires more than isolated assessment. All is brought together in our regard, as all things generally weave in with eachother. And the remarks we need are so as to ordain the greatest tapestry, and the fabric and stitching techniques which are essential in procurring so: and at that, hold the pivot point by which contraiety is judged by: for the means to our good, however limiting, are such as, insomuch as they are true, to neccessitate the exlusion of things which run in contrast to them: at least, in as much as the good which they procure is sought. For our efforts then are such as to only be according to our care to actually succeed: while our course to doing so is something entirely seperate, in that its formation comes from discriminate inquiry: and our interest in selecting this way, and amending to it in whichever outputing manner, is up to me.

        <div id="modesofthought">
            So empiricists acquaint themselves with the world, and derive inductions, or likelihoods, based on the expereince they have; while rationalists, work from first principles in order to derive what is neccessary, and by that deduce. Of the former, folks are fair to presume, or suppose rather, as much as their induction grants; but they are indeed stepping beyond certainty, and taking for gratned what may or may not happen by the likely nature which their reasoning is based on: but we can say, fairly, that as strong the induction is, so are they fair in their presumption. While rationalists, and those in realm of possibility, indeed have more certainty to their claims; but the actual soundness, or suitability to their claims, holds no guarentee prior to the judgement of their premise' grounds. For one may say that things are to be a certain way, and by that hold a certain conclusion; but who is to say what things are, and at that, how they are, as our expereince would rightfully show. And the point isn't so much that observation is the soul insight to the subjects which we base our principles on, only, that of such identities, so does their place as the effective basis for such principle reasoning, require some sort of clearence as to the soundness in which such subjects are used. For instance, one may say, that all things need a beginning; yet, of all things which are, so much as we call them events, so is the notion of beginning quite irrelevant, and in some cases innappropriate. 
            <br>&emsp;This is indeed a struggle of proportion, for the lack of one side brings much trouble to the other, in that, as much as each side supposes, so do they each rely on such bases. For, an absolute truth of things is needed for our observations to make sense, for things seem confusingly distinct yet together; yet, as we better identify them in such an investigaive way, we end up moudling them with proprties which the rationalists are concerned with, that being their origin, constiuency and such. And at that, the claims of the rationalists are so, as to be only strong as the elements which they use have any real basis; for their buisness truly is in whats possible, but as remarks what is, as if, of such possibility, is actual, so ought the reasoning for that align. And at that, so is our understanding of what is actual a limit to what we think the conduct of possibility is: for withtou the former, we cannot truly speak to the latter, in that, of what were saying, is what it is with respect to what and how it affords. And the evidence which correlates to that, as if proof to the reasoning, is somewhat representative of the strenght of such reasoning, in that it rightfully accounts for what it is proporting. 
            <br>&emsp;As in all things, the issue comes to identity; for in this lies the issue of origins, as a thing which has one will be, as a thing, invovled with such; and at that, include such aspect in our usage of them as a subject, and in some sense render the question mute. The Gurlbeshit as the German's say, 'why is this, this?'. And at any rate, the details of our inquiry may be, however complex, situated around this identity. And unfortunately, a procees appropriate to our place as inquiries, is required: for the place of such a technique is ultaitmely, and evidently seemingly, squeezed out over the time following our sure conclusions:  whereby the basic weakesses of our claims make leave for furthering questions as to enligthen a farther truth. This process is my approach, and at that stems from our view of inquiry. Which indeed, balances the favors and reality of principles and observation; but so to, of the complexions of each, do we, as the inquirer grow, and at that learn more about what we are trying to ask: to which we can give more promsing thoughts. And an anwser truly exists: at least I grant the proper belief in this. But our proces holds no place in being anything but militantly endless: for who, in their right mind, when the basis of things is sought after, rightly sees that, from our current spot, when, where, or if even, to any probale degree, the end of such inquiry?

        <div id="mindandwit">
            So perception is a sort of stream of inputs, whereby the expression of things impart themselves upon you, yeilding percepts. Conception, is the identification of these things, in an intellectual sense: the yeild being a concept.
            <br>&emsp;Now, looking at the redness of a red apple, one may perceive this, in a flowing sense, but then define it more deliberately: at least the property of red. Similarly, we can draw a shape, such as a circle, and at that derive concepts from it. The shape itself, being more abstract than the apple, is indeed a multitue of points whose relations are, in most ways, presupposed, or upon learning them at least; and at that, the general 'circularness' of the shape is perceived -as it is shown- but so may we, akin to the various proofs surrounding the Pythagoream theorem, concieve further relations regarding the shape, and at understand more.
            <br>&emsp;When we come to the notion of God though, or a perfect being, or that of infinity, nothingness and other truly abstract notions, you can see how, albeit abstract, that the concepts of the circle are born through the perception of a more existent thing. Our belief in those former notions is one thing, but the actual perception of them is quite bare. And at that, our concenptions born from them seem built on the defintion we have of the object in question: and indeed such  an object, or thing of precept, is not so existence, or real in any fair sense.
            <br>&emsp;This, to me, is the problem of philosophy. For some, in their wiless wit, see the conception of those completely abstract objects as supreme; as if our intellect is forming ideas and (concepts) of the purest things. 
            <br>&emsp;I think this is false in many ways, or without much grounds in reality. But still, one may still personally conceive and expereince the purity at that. But I am not entirely sure this is whats going on. The diffiuclty of describing this process along the lines of basic laws, language and behaviour is tricky. But, I can say, that so much as we are clear on what, in reality, there is, then I believe that these 'pure conceptions' are nothing more than the physical processes of language and behaviour conceiving: and the latter notion is a mere detail of this process, but a surface level element at that. This presumes, or works from the basis that cognition is physical, indeed. But I can say, that beyond this murky notion, that the actual expereince by which we concieve, holds a continuity of increasing preference, or sweentess that is. The prior notion is that concieving the deepest of objects remarks the richest expereince; yet, concepts are mere marks of what we see, and our attempt to fully conceive them through identity. Pragmatic this may be, but I see the pondering of absolute objects as a sort of overly bent inquiry, whereupon the muddled knowledge that we have colors the potential clarity as something both afar, and perfect -as compared to the imperfection were privy to now. But this is not so virtuous by my account, at least as inquiry is invovled. For one, the grounds by which these absolute ponderings conduct themselves, is not truly special, in that they are, either A) different as inquiriers do to the material their inquiring to, and B) seperate from any other sort of inquiriers, with a mere difference in the variety of things one inquires to. But, regarding the nature of inquiry as part of our behaviour, and at that a misappropraite of it as something privy to, or an indicator for the pure objects they see.
            <br>&emsp;What I see otherwise, is that concepts are like marks, in that they hold more defined and deliberate detail; and from here, what you further see will contain those definitions. As if the sun browned the sky, and through inquiry you termed the gradient by which its further points differed than the flat horizon; and upon annother sunset, so may you see the gradient within it, and at that, your view of the sunset has changed. 
            <br>&emsp;The question then, is of such concept, that if it is of an addition to what you otherwise percieved, then what are we really initally privg to with respect to pure objects, and our then subsequent conceptulaization. Perhaps additions are not what their trying to make, and they do, in some way, merely wish to percieve. Yet, the obvious refuation of, 'well so are we conceiving then as to be aware of these objects; by virtue of their unexistence, so must we conceive them, as an origin to their mark upon us, or an addition at least as to give the purity more body and deifintion: as to be more amply seen -which some reflect as the greatest privilage, to see such purity.' 
            <br>&emsp;In these regards I am troubled to make the distinction of merriting any findings of such pure coneption, whereby we honor the actual plasure and joy of doing so, but recognize no genuine findings; that, compared to the real conceptions of things, and how we to our benefit and pleasure, further those. And indeed, much is to be said about the former, while the latter is a mark of privilage and character: the balance at least. "As wise men in poor times fair more than the richest of fools."

        <div id="windandbreeze">
            Concepts feel strange. For on one side, you have notions such as, 'my income is such, and clearly, considering our literal income, we have this much leftover when we balance our outgoing spending'. This acts as a sort of breadth to our otherwise financial sensibiliity; which might, via past experience, act on the sense of our ability to spend, freely, or with restraint; but so in more natural and sensible ways. For instance, none really rely on concepts to know that they can't purchase a sports car: they almost intuitively know, and can see such a thing without defining it clearly, and measuring it agaisnt other knowledge. While a new shirt is equal, but flipped, in that we hardly go through the books to do so, and more merrily act as our sense permitts. "And in some ways, be it a mark of health of bit by bit spending, so do we buy a cup of coffee everyday, simply because it is what we do -and such habit comes from the meagerness of each incident, and how our admission to so without much thought creates a frequent prescence." 
            <br>&emsp;I do not do much mathematics, but I do play a fair bit of games; and although the meaning of concepts is not seemingly bent on such local matters, but I can only drill it down to our actions otherwise being of more immedaite and unsifted responses, while a more deliberate approach includes the detailing and use of concepts, as if to better see the eleemnts in question, address them not only via their clarity, but also in ways that are fuller themselves. This indeed is what I would ascribe the term 'mark', in that, of what we expereince, so do we learn and or describe things, as to see them better. And, generally, much of what we expereince is overlooked if not for its relevance to us, be it for pleasure or duty. And because such things seem important, we concieve further details as to further our subsequrent relation with such things. A stranger for instance who catches your interest, may remain so, and at that hold much awkwardness as you unfamilialry speak with them; but learning their name, and upon the next conversation, you address them as such, and thus engage with them according to this new view you have. Personally, this process translates into a positive expereince, whereby the eleemnts of the world which enter my liberated mind (via modernity and character) urge me to identify them more deeply, so that I may further see them later on, and remark upon them at that. "For man has grown up with most of his regards set on negative things, and the aversion to that. Food in contrast, is something that civil folk have been privialged over the recent millenias, and at that, conjured more ways to refer to and act upon such interests: as such details allow us to further invovle ourselves with such common and frequent elements."
            <br>&emsp;Something which comes to mind then are symbols, and the concretness which they reflect. For the basis of language is tough, and our according behaviour, but we can generally say that such things remark, in the ways they are active, things which are relevant and or existent to our lives. This is why we all know words for hot, sweet, danger, while few have any understanding of a circle's true proportions. And at that, I see that we can learn what such a shape is, and other things of a mathemtaical sort. But there is this threshold of reality, more or less, where the superficial notion of maximum and minium, extent and barrenness, perfection and the detail of being lie; and, in there, lies to an extent these mathematical principles. And alebit an exception I'd say to the more or less strict abstractness of those prior elements, so is this so, or permitted rather, in that, of real things, so do they exhibit the relations which, be it sourced from or presupposed, such abstracts have. Only, were talking numbers here, not figurative concepts. Those, at least, hold no evidence beyond their abstract conception. At that, numbers, configured in a certain way, will show relations to one another which can be described. 4 steps up, 3 steps left perpinduclar to that and at the base of the former, and the distance between the ends of each will be, if you took that many steps for each and added that many, that many times (squared), added the value together, then rooted the value; which is to say that, by whichever equation, you found the amount of steps, if taken and added to by that amount steps, that many times, to reach that prior value. Which indeed is 5. This relation, so much as the numbers which procure it noramally are in place, will reveal this form regularly. But is this real? I do not know in the abstract sense; for I give some permitt to see it so based on a humility to all things, but specifically to the resemblence which even its most abstract circusmtance finds in reality. But I think ultiamtley, that as such relations, or resemblences to the abstract, as found in reality, are the only real thing; and that it is more of a mistake of language and cognition to see our concepts of these of an intellectual sort as something beyond reality, and mental. This is indeed is the hazy division between abstract and real thinking, and the actions of the latter. And I would say, regarding mathematics, that their place as real things is more in line, to the extent that they are real, as they reflect but our recognition of something in the real world; and as one may say that, in terms of light, that something is bright, shaded, red, spotted, jagged etc., that so may one say that something is circular, in that it holds a uniform distance from some center point to its edge. These are indeed concepts, as an tree which has fallen slightly compared to one which has fallen greatly, does show a smaller angle in the latter, and at that our regards may develop identive notions of these; as are numbers and syllables a more conjurable way to speak about everything. But so are symbols such, in that they represent things; and that, as microbes are but earlier parts of the continuity which the heat of mammals is a point of, and the dexterity of a capuchin opening a nut, and the basics of man making suttle sounds and indications of things, increasingly, to our more complex language and the register of concepts which we have (as we can, and have developed tools, to represent more thing), so are we in truth more privy to things of that register, but so little modern as much as we 'make things' from those represnetations.
            <br>&emsp;And that is in some sense the difference. From the base of it,  concepts are details which we use to identify things, or at least broaden our ability to do so. "as their may be little which our lack of a concept would have ever slightly shown; but, as if we had learned elsewhere, we may see some descriptive term, that upon embracing, would let us see things with respect to that." And, besides this representationl model, where true langauge and behaviour lie, so are their concepts which concieve of things not so existent, or representationl beyond the illusions of our experience. Which, indeed, is a fair source of such high conceptiosn, as dreams, imagery, the looseness of imagery, and all the mistaken testimonies and experince that foolishly impress us with something to be subject of our conception, may in fact be the source for us detailing such subjects with further concepts; but, from a soucre which is not wholly founded. "Its as if someone told you they say bigfoot, and based on your real notion of gorillas, you applied your regards of those to this knowledge of bigfoot (as the person shared). But then, seeing as you don't know enough besides the basis form and the details you've added, you come up with new notions which can be added to that, as was likely done with the early impressions of gorillas. As for instance, the fact that they were fury was something not so unobvious, but the distnction between gorrilas with respect to their furyness, gave merrit to defining a term for the kind of furyiness. And so to this baser form, and the details we already had, do wo concieve of new ones, as if to give it a name, a history and reason for its being." The strange thing, is that this process is hardly singular in its soucre, as one person tells a story there and we concieve it as we can, and another person does the same, and so forth we conceive. These two subjects though become a source for eachothers conception, as the insight of one, derives sentiments which are applied to the latter; and over time, as the body of these subjects grows into the thousands, and the fruitfullness from each extends to those around, so does a innerwoven fabric of whats real and the according conceptions come to be. But, these are all based on those earlier stories, whose missapprhensions magnify over time. Moreover, the diffiuclty of representing things around this developed body of knowledge, beomces somewhat judged on the way it fits within such body. "Ding Ding Gallileo."
            <br>&emsp;<br>&emsp;Out of the Past
            <br>&emsp;I say, quite comfortably, that modernity is coming, and that, merrily, it assumes only a fair and common grasp on the details of things. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the mystery which we pre-modernly presumed, is not there; and at that, our overly bent and brooding conduct to learn the truth in all, is not so warranted or of need. And, in fact, though this is only for beliefs, is whether such truth, so forcefully, and at that erroneously, conceived, is actually a matter which can be so, and at that is, in being true, so; and at that, our we every so privy this in ability, and neccessity at that. 
            <br>&emsp;The theory of truth is one thing. But I care little for a forced conception of what it is, or ought to be, on empty basis'. Motivation isnt a reason for disregard, but, in our inquiry otherwise to how things are, so do I respect the motivations which others are encouraged by as to see such truth; as they do it so forecfully, and at that contrive much of its structure, and at that neglect the reality which we are privy to in the simplest of ways. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, our conceptual framework is more of a response, and at that a binding of such responses, as to more abily speak in generality. But the buisness of man is not in erecting these bindings to some plausible peak, or dreamt one. Again, belief is one thing, and aspiration holds no quarrel. But pretending like this is relatable to the world at hand is a mistake, and in increasing ways, holds less resemblence to it -as we understood the real world. 
            <br>&emsp;What I can say, fully, is that the need for this belief, or hunch, to be met, is in the depths of inquiry, and its awkward shortcomings; in that, of reality, or pure conception, we struggle to fully, or, respectively, fairly say, what basis for our concepts are: and at that, what the truth should be, and thus our course to it. For the bounds of this depiction are such, that the world has become somewhat substantial, while the conceptual world has been pushed out, or squeezed rather to its most abstract edge. Case in point, gravity, thermodynamics, wave theory and quark dynamics have filled out the conceptual holes which even our early modern theories speculated upon -or thought their abstract ideas as being fit for that, as a limit perhaps of what we could know otherwise. And of this portrayal, I can say, as a man, that the outline of this all appears in contridictroy ways to the foliage of ideas and expereince which have grown from ancient times to this nearly modern day. And at that, the mystery which such roots were levelled upon, is no longer an issue; at least, the genuine concern being our death, holds not but a natural pleasure, in the rest it in reality brings. I am not afraid or in any ways averse to lettting reality squeeze out the contemporay schematics of old, and let our modern expereince settle in as a true model of natural respect, and at that our place as a member subject to its ways. For in that, the truth I see is defintiively preferable, and at that worth respecting more than those who work to scheme away from this seemingly natural truth, but are to nieve to see its benefits: and in some sense, beyond their repsectble attempt, insincere in their wish for some other end than the readily apparent truth. The annals of progress are such, that the map of progress is blended, in that those who, by todays accounts seem foolish, were in fact pioneers; but their relative progress does not warrant the fruits of their labors being seen as true an eternity later. As the person who invented the wheel was indeed the einstein of locomotion; but ought combuistion, and the cars using it, respect anything more than the current state of progress which that ingenuity springed? Or should we honor its findings based on the time, as if there was some deeper truth that the relative granduer of the success revealed. 
            <br>&emsp;I don't know, and in fact I am simply rambling, and have no actual point to say.

        <div id="chainofpropiety">
            My life is not lacking in liberty. And not souly due to our modern privalage, but character too. None of the folk who my sensibilities are in thanks to, lived in any time which was not comparaatively unprivaleged, yet still flourished due to their virtue and self regard. And, however well off they were in their respective times, so are we, in our worst, still on par -so much as we are poor within modernity that is. And, as regards the ebbs of life which strike at us all, so is class and fortune a mere garnish to that, and besides the point then.
            <br>&emsp;What I can say despite all this, is that our occupation is awry, if only due to our frugality in treating the point of it -and then living as though we were free.
            <br>&emsp;Morals on the other hand are a sort of confusion, and at that, bear their pressing head so much as our idea of occupation is out of line with those around me, and the culture at large. 
            <br>&emsp;For it is hard to tell someone that your needs and wishes are simple, and that our liberal steps are warranted by virtue of our sufficient success. There is a complex development, generally through the whole of society, and specifically, through your particular lineage, which brings you to see the world a certain way; and, at that, how those around you and most impactfull have views similarly. I don't lack this reason, as the worth of things has always been clear; and, so much as we were't involed with the common goods around, that our intensity in being so avert was partially do to the fake elements which were evident reasons for such norms. And the reason that such fakeness seemed clear is in part due to our dad, who is not a fake person. And so, besides the history of our choices, and our predilections which drove us, I can say that such outputs, as our current moment, is in fact a detail of that continuity. We can trust at least that there is a reason for our choices by that sentiment, and the specifics are but a detailing of such account.
            <br>&emsp;For I am in a place where all which makes me happy, is not so unclear or hard to attempt. Only, the ability to do so is not yet integrated within the norms which would make us otherwise happy; and at that, our reserved approach to living rightly, comes at the expense of those thing which make us happy, or call out to us at least. In many ways, this has caused a distortion of things, as our wish to be amidst the norms of people, but in a truer way, has me seeing our truth as a sort of leverage point (by virtue of its novelty) which is best aimed at acquiring a place in those norms. The ways of our true self are all we have, and thus the soul pick for anything we'd do, and, our time in such place, however procurred, is more clearly kept for you to be in such a true way, if the procurement and maintence of such place is through such truth.
            <br>&emsp;But all this is a remark of us being unhappy, or outside the common goods. Which is fine normally, as most men of the past have known. Only, when we are not so good in our truer way, so do those common goods seem more appealling and absent, which itself ties back into our motivation to reach said goods through the truth we have, and at that, begs us to return to a state of goodness, as if the motivation to do so (by virtue of its procurment of those common goods) was more desired.

        <div id="giftofkin">
            So, it is standard, as much as the scenario is expected, that for my children we wish well. But what this means is quite different depending on your concerns for them. And at any rate, rather than divulge what you'd want, we may simply speak to the two distinct approaches which one may take to preparing for and managing their childs life.
            <br>&emsp;One, is to do with fortune, such as a home, a nest egg etc., while the other is of proficiency, or the promience of one's ability to be sufficeint in their life. This latter is such, as to call on all people to meet their needs through effort and duty, with proficiency being an extension of that. For one may be a minimum wage worker, and feed themselves doing that; or they may be a plumber, or harness some other form of craft, to earn more -and through a more elegant and flavorfull occupation at that. This compares with fortune, in that its goal is to provide freedom from effort; as one's interest in investing into a home, or a fund, is so that it becomes an asset which pays you later on. 
            <br>&emsp;But in regards to our cares for a child, it equates to what I, in my highest dreams would seek. And that this would simply be the best of living: which our time is the soul factor, and limited by our employment of it: and this holds little cares for all but sufficient funds. And at that, if we simply say that our aim is to spend our time well, then we see, that despite the freeom fortunes afford, that their accumulation and preservation is done so through much ardor and committment. Consequently, two drawbacks occur, namely the allocation of our time during the investing period, in both the dedication to contributing (to your investment) and, in the case of a home, the riggidness that such an asset brings; and secondly, upon the actual taste of the invesment all that time later on, that of the actual benefit it offered, in the open lane for good living, that such goodness within living, in terms of one's aptitude and their interest, had not yet been cultivated. And indeed, being ignorant of this is an error along all paths; but, in the case of nurturing our fortune, so do its committments keep our culvitaion within the actual needs and love of living at a compramised level.
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, our care for our children is present so much as we have a sight on such a situation; and I would say, with an even head and tempered heart, that our interest in reaching such a scenario is complimentary, if not, at its core, entirely derired from our more evident pleasures of friends and family, people in general. And at that we can say, as a preface, that the wish for chidlren, or sight of them forthcoming, is likely due to its natural extension of our already human interest. There is no genuine need for it, but our hearts tend to want otherwise; and, with some relfection, it is fair to consider the composure of our selves and mind, and how any uneveness there may bend our interests to something besides children; or, as it is sometimes known (or depicted), that such idea of children, coming into us by the lens of our true selves, may be overly glarring and undesirable. But that is for such person to decide: while we note their reasons otherwise.

        <div id="seaofexpression">
            I'd say that what we mean by intelligence, is the ability to point to things, mark them, bear regard, and advance this by detailing beyond the mere subjects in question, but their properties, relations etc.
            <br>&emsp;At that, akin to agriculture permitting new occupation, that so is langugae facilaited by freer circustances, where more is seen and attended to. This indeed is something which takes ages, while the former takes but a segment (ie. antiquity).
            <br>&emsp;Relevant to this is broader means of communciation, such as books, letters and, as of recent, radio. This seem to offer two kinds of interaction, namely converse, be it social or administravitelvy, or that of engagement, such as a novel, a song, a play. 
            <br>&emsp;When the breadth of communciation expanded, namely in letters, accounts, and the propogation of information via books, so did the world expand for the better. But there was no such thing as a film, or the radio, or a webpage. The content was there, but in analog form, as you would have to perform the music, or be there to here it perfomed; and euqally for a play or a speech. Whereas now, these are all packaged effectively into letters, whereby you can recieve the expereince on your own terf. 
            <br>&emsp;Similar to special goods in the past that became mass produced and accordingly accessibly, that now we are inundated with a mix of elected and or expressed products. And to be quite frank, I find none of it that compelling. Or, at least, compared to the true goods one has, and those of a consumer sort, so do I see the roots of converse and culture as something seperate, in value at least, or nourishment, when it comes to that which is so pieced out and conveyed. And our choices seem somewhat consurmable when we look for these things, and otherwise subject to when billboards are there while passing by.
            <br>&emsp;A reassuring thought is that most of this is not to do with authority, as that is till settled by letters and true reference. These other matters seem like a leisurely sort, or an enthusiast sort. 
            <br>&emsp;The trouble though, is that people do learn from this outputs. And the concern of someone like me is in whether or not their impressionss lead them to jump to conclusions. Parts of the world seem so dissolute, as the culture which comes from these modern communcations amount to a fair, where the content is swirled around in areas that are created with respect to such content; while the normal lanes and swaths of the world remain mroe or less common with respect to how they are derived from what is accordingly communicable. 
            <br>&emsp;I'd remind you that the creation of a country is quite a moment, and in the case of the US, done through a seperation from the motherland. This is not relevant to us now; and a new constitution seems wtihtou means or motive. Then, concerning the amanicpation act, that the pains to get this through, in a legalsative sense, is such that even of an issue so deep and prevalanent, that a war had to be fought over it. In our current case, it seems more like Hollywood and message platforms are responding to apprehensions of folk, centered around bullying and representation. But these outlets are not a country, as we hold no onlige to them, nor they any authority over us. And it is indeed looking at things from their side of things out, to say that those invovled are influential in the public realm, and thus worth our concern as much as such an enviroment is conducted. Only, such an environment is like an arena, or hunting grounds within the broader empire. And the empire is not subject to it, but the other way around. Google does not marshal its policies with any force of law; but, as a public institutuoin, its conduct is obliged under the laws of the country it is housed by; in the same way that the judicial system is the carrier for an inccurence within a resteraunt: the latter is but a veseel for the judicious heart it is housed upon. And even then, if Google could penalize folk, it would be within the platform, of which we are with no oblige to take part in; or it would go through the due process of the public courts, and at that deal with the perpetrator as they are with respect to such realm, of which google is equally a member. 
            <br>&emsp;A very narrow minded view still needs depth, or lenght at least. For the effect of online discourse is such, as one can only say, the outcome of a presidency; which is itself a primary node in the nation's fabric. But the stitching of it stays, and at that remains aloft and cloth like. The proporations of modern communcations effects are in need of stating, but the actual concern which they may cause is not much more than a change of captain. The boat remains, as does the proper conduct of navigation. And at that, most who man such a position are some sort of captain. Our discourse though is stuck on the far side of things though. For I mean only to describe the situation, or times. And indeed, the hardest thing to do, is to say that people's invovlemtn with a dissolute source, and their concerns accordingly, are without cause. We are best otherwise to explain the world, from principle and evidence, and more rightly see the subject of consumer media. Effective communcations marshal the processes of the world; and, indeed, are not to be blamed as accomplaices with respect to their use in poor scenarios. That is a culutral issue, not the furnishings. But the consumption of indirec sources, be a preacher, a play, a film, or the radio, are simply dropped upon us, be it elected by taste, or through the complexion of the source. 
            <br>&emsp;It is so important to note that this carnival of consumer media is entered and exited to and from the world. Its lands and granduer are in the smallest ways described by miles and decades; and in its largest, countries and centuries. Your impressions from film, radio, tv, magazines and prompters is like converse at a dinner table. It is brought upon you like a resterautn serves: and they have no say or impact on the nature of or standard of food. There is merely a propietor, and of the property which you engage on. And the consumerates of media are akin to woodstock or a wild band of hippies living in Arizone, in that they create their own grounds. But I live on the grounds of the West, and that of the world and time. And the goods I see are the ones native to those.

        <div id="trek">
            So, comparing Star Trek and New trek, the common distinction is one of virtue. Each presents something, and indeed the entertainment is determined by how they present it. But as an old tale of a sort is not comaprable to a modern drama, so is the message in the former still accessible, and meaningdull at that. 
            <br>&emsp;In this wsy, Star Trek is about a future where intelligence, dignity, and humanity are revered and employed. While New Trek, is like modern TV: very grim in its views, full of criticism and contempt. And in this, all the people depicted are vicious and selfish, irepputable. And acroos the board it seems, rather than a particular individual. 
            <br>&emsp;To me, this is a very young adult theme, where the dystopian view of the future comes from a negative outlook on things; not a pessimistic, as the one to some extent is by their bases regard for our suns collapse; but a negatvie one, where peoplre are shown to be irreputable and of vice. A sort of misanhtropy if you will.
            <br>&emsp;Star Trek seems more for adults, as, per you state of being one, so are you subject to the world and its domain. And perhaps the most basic rule, as you'd share with chidlren, is that it is not the worlds fault that you error, but your own. By that, we color this notion with responsability, as no one else is going to do it for you. And what it seems, is that, per the YA novels of the recent decade, or the stark contrast to raunchy comedies in the grimmness to drama, is this unacquainted point of view from the real world, but that of youth, or adolescence. In one, there is a peak confidence, as the sheltered location is overcome, and one becomes a sort of ace teenager. There is not much negativity here. But as one becomes dutied withi nthe world, so is there ability spent tasks, as their needs motivate. And at that, so much as this dynamic is not overcome, as most adults eventually do, so is one adoslcscent; in that they are actionable in the right ways, but burdened by it somewhat, or enclosed. While a confident teenager is merely thriving in a small safe world, so is a young one who is not, merely without confidence, by their age we'll say; while someone who is odler, and at least has become acquaited with the needs of the world, so is their employment there on which is outside of that safe world, but equally unthriving -(or overcome). And the confident teen is one who merely goes from there small completness into a large incompletion; while the shy and nervous teen is merely brought into the world, and incoplete in equal ways.
            <br>&emsp;And I believe there is this negativity and unadmirable perecption of the world from these sort of people. Subject matter is one thing, but an older, grown up view, would not hold such contemptable views: as if the world were wrong. No one, as I have read, and expereinced, who has virtue, finds much vice in the world, except that of negligence of cultivation. For our steadyness sees nothing wrong with the world; in fact there are many blessings, but a failure to meet them; with a consquent proness to falling, and missing out on the goods available. Theres just not this attitude from those who are not endowed with virtue, or flourishing. "As rich folk complain less, but hold no less complaints regarding their likely losses (by their possession) as much as their character is absent as those who are poor."
            <br>&emsp;In many ways, our view of the world is one thing, and others their own. But it is this awry feeling that each is different. And by my accounts, the tension comes from a lack of description in how others feel. For if we did, we'd see that their apprehnesion was more of a personl struggle, rather than a social consequence. And, that as much as it was, so was it pitched opposiute of the core civil matters. "For in this world, the world burns, or judges are appealled to."

            A discriminate life, on the whole, is a natural one, as per our species, we learn and inquire, and at that fail to ever reach a threshold where our enlightnemnet is finished. 
            <br>&emsp;Across broad periods of time, there may be a general sentiment of fullness; but so does something new which catches one's eye, lead to further discovery and definition.
            <br>&emsp;I would say, currently, that there is a fairly concentrated transition in our culture, both in a recent sense regarding the current and past century; but also that of a macro sense, where we are on route to nearly being modern; which in many ways, is akin to being civilized, but of a completed kind.
            <br>&emsp;Because of this, there is a lack of certainty; if only because our pleasure and content through communication is befuddled, and thus there is a good amount of apprhension. Clarity though is reflected upon, at least a lack of one draws the other. And by doing this, we describe things, patch things up; which is indeed the vector of any sort of progress.
            <br>&emsp;On one hand, you have the broader elements of our time, which one may more feesibly ponder and sharpen; but all through an inquisitive lens, or positive one rather. But then there are those elements of old, or at least ones which are in the same way dragging. This is the antinquity of the time, the glossiness, the dissproportion; and at that, the struggle to communciate this, and not feel seperate otherwise, or in turn accept the norms at hand.
            <br>&emsp;And what I'd say, is that because we are in a curious state, that so do things which, in a more clarified time, would pass us by, call on us to question them. The reason is not for curiosities sake, as if all is promising; but rather, our basis is undirected and set, and as new information comes in, we make sure to not let false concepts in. And, as I confess, the poorness of certain impressions has me alert to their arrival; as if our sensitivty to things by being curious, also has us in a less accepting state of those things seemingly dissproprition: all due to our discretionate state.
            <br>&emsp;By that, I see negativity which comes from a lack of description of the world, for there is not enough for you to settle on, and let falsity wobble along. And indeed, the extent of our need to clarify the world comes from our solitude; which can only be explained by our personal discretion, and the ways it holds accordingly -in interest, reservation, or mere affibility.

            The roots of our apprehension are accessible, and by that deemed real. But our current trouble with such an affliction can only be described as 'revealing'. As the wears around you which rub up against said ways, only offer an insight into how that line of development has faultered: as our view of other things appears unchecked, as our more primary concenrs, upon their abscence, draw in shortcomings of other attentions.
            <br>&emsp;But, as I sit here, remisnicing as to why were so astray, I realize that the friction within this is to do with our pursuit of having such cares; and at that, a past which is respectable for its current process, and a future which is promising via what said line will bring, and at that our calrified amends and peacefull foresight as a conseuqnece of being so devout to such line (and its evident offer). 
            <br>&emsp;And what I feel, is that others around, be it our mother or dad, a friend, or colleuges even, the world as a whole, these are but surroundings which our approach to things melds with, or does not. And I see, that what I seek, is the freedom to pursue at our pleasure. And the inability to do so, or friction rather, is from disharmony with those sources.
            <br>&emsp;For me, the wonder of curiosity is always present; and conclusions which are, as it were, final, seem more bullheaded and constrained: for who could not further ask or inquire. And at that, as I breathe, and upon airs abscence grasp, so do I see things around, and accordingly respond. And positively so as my senses are not occupied with neccessary matters, but things which catch our wandering sight. 
            <br>&emsp;And indeed, there is this hue of reservation and apprhension; and an according appeal to proportion. But, this is best set in our suitable clarities, rather than clearing oppression. For the certainty and muddlesness of the world is but a lingering force, which penetrates our less than vital mind. And in that, pierces us, holds us, digs itself in; whereby our ingenuity becomes therefore placed, as if to defeat this confining enemy.
            <br>&emsp;And thereby, I accordingly seek; which is not to defeat that which drags at my mind, but to ultimately remain skeptical, forward, limbre.

        <div id="boltedclaim">
            I see our development as a polishing key. For all apprehensions and mistaken views come from a detour from the natural alignment which such proccess' amounted to.
            <br>&emsp;By that, I can say, that all which is amuck, is so, because it seems different then what were used to; meaning that during our successfull points of development, we expereinced the proper form of life; and at that situated ourselves in a dispositional sense, whereby things which were contrary seemed ill founded, if only because there basis was born from a conduct than that which we already found true.
            <br>&emsp;But these maligned expereinces leave holes, or knots at least; and, as much as we are acting well, so is the levity of such experience, and initation at that, weighed down, or rather tugged against. Indeed this is but a friction, but so are there loose threads which become so, as the rising side from our success, has stiffer points which fail to equally extend. In a way, passion results, as what you see ahead, or imagine at least, as the place where that restrcited point would reach, is so as to be as it were, foreseen, while you were dragged behind. 
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, this uneven levity leaves scarrs in our otherwise fine expereince; and at that creates splotches and reserve. This does not remove the worth of the lines which are properly drawn; but indeed, it is as if one part of you is expereincing pleasure, while another less so. As I have found, the sum of this brings with it a sort of acceptence of any shortcoming, as the less there are, the easier it is for any impurites to be looked past. Yet, being somewhere in the middle, whereby your shine is but a mere average, and albeit up and glowing, is still too dull to counterbalance the dragging weight below. Or in other words, because you are somewhat forward, the drag from below becomes all to apparent. If you were otherwise flat, then you may not notice, and then divulge into a sort of empty depression, or gluttony.
            <br>&emsp;But the expereince of drag is an interesting one. For, in the case of defense, so are our senses alerted for preservation; and at that, our responses to things are to diminish, by vifrtue of the nnegative suggestion. While postivie ones (of suggestion that is), curry your further interest, and at that invite you to offer a generous amount -with no wished for, or clear even, cease. But in that, lies the contratiety of being both drawn and generous. For, disposition in some sense, colors our interests, as one does when their affection for someone becomes more than present, but ingrained; yet, in a future moment, they may be unable to treat them as their heart desires. 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, I lack no dispostion when it comes to provisions, the fair means of such developments, our interests, nor their fullest embrace. Yet, this latter troubles itself with our core errors, wherein we muddy the deepest threads. And, more or less, our sight of things becomes equally stained; and despite remaining in convictin, so does our direction feel flat, as if our cares are idle. 
            <br>&emsp;But so ought a man learn what it means to be so. For not only does his wish to proceed unintruded demand the dearest claim, in that it was not desirous or reserved, but that the nature of things which his success grants such freedoms is properly accounted for; which we might say invovles a fair assessment of nature, and the suitable conduct. For in many ways, an unveness to this basic regard, will make choices which are relevant to our excess prone to impurity. 
            <br>&emsp;Yet, in these remarks I see a struggle. For sobriety seems the requisite for liberty, as not doing so blackens her sight. But prioiritizing such, while clarity fondly sees, is not so easy when the wears of the world are amuck: at least the dynamics of that, of which we, as people, are privy to in social ways, becomes as such relevant. As, primairly, the association of people becomes troublesome when sobriety is sought for anything but divine [absolute] reasons; nor, is our own infamy and civil struggle a practical or admittable state of content, whereby our focus on sobriety can be amply treated.
        </div>
        <div id="tobetterbe">
            I indeed wish to see the real dynamics of the world, its ebbs at least. But, the friction around actually seeing problems, comes from the dissproprtionate views of others. I would like to see that taxes were changed to an extnet, or some regulation removed; but when the environment is so angsty about this, and poses as if these changes are some indubitable threat, then I lean on ignornance. 
            <br>&emsp;Which indeed is a source of seperation from the rest of the world; as our impact from any of lifes changes are ours to deal with essentially. Yet, the notion that others lives change to, is a little discomforting, when the squabbling of elders and pundants makes me cower away from the broader world. Perhaps I know to little not to be overcome by their regards, and find no interest in critiquing their basis. Nor do I find much warrant in it, for the fair effects of the things actually changed, don't leave much stress on how others deal with it. The real issue is people's distress at there being a change at all; like it represents something, and forboding at that; yet, the actuall adjustment is but a minnor degree, and more or less genial to all, no matter if its preferable.
            <br>&emsp;And I am generally convinced, on my own end, that these squabblings bring apprhension because of our aim in life, which is to live it well and truly. The greatest source of this care, is the discretion of life being varied in its ways; and at that, how all things produce slight if not whole effects to such ends. And from this, comes what Plato dealt with, namely a discouragment of leisure, purrid comforts and gratuity. And at that, comes a sort of educated apprehension, and the sight of so many people living in apparently vicious ways. To which the world seems consquently doomed.
            <br>&emsp;But I am not so convinced people do in fact live in such ways, at least with a complex whose proprotions are negativie to themselves, and to others -as you'd exepct at least. And of our view, it really comes down to us as a viewer. For as passion clenches are interests for the time ahead, so does our reservation to others become stiffened by our equal impurity. And, in this sense, our cares for true living, is such as to congregate (in our actions) with respect to meeting what is positive, and avoiding what is negative. And from my expereince, the states which are unfaciliative to whats positive, bring with it an exposure to negative attitudes and states; whereby the words and actions of others appear hostile, forboding, ill discretionate and farced. In many ways, our aversion to this is two sided coin, in that our positivity feels encouraged to remain so, while being stuck with such scrutinous regards, strickens me away, from myself to some extent; which does not in itself faciliate positivity, but a rigid escape from negativity. But this is akin to a childs response to their parent's abrasive behaviour, whereby they, in there ability to be active, deny such teachings, scold it, and hate the sender. 
            <br>&emsp;In many ways life is such, that our growth and development comes from mere honesty; and although the aim of things, in their clearest state, seems wortwhile and simple to make, that so are we amidst natural and or social misfortunes. For indeed, our place in life is but a part in the stream of things, and as if a product of the times, so has modernity, or liberty and curisoity rather, brought much felicity to such flow. "As if our strides are more accurate to natures current, and at that more able to keep up, fully, boldly, and richly." But so does this point of development in our lives require some form of recognition, of which the baser tenants of nature must be addressed, and that of our common lives. For the tendering of our heart and soul, albeit softenig of nature's basic fairs, and fruitfull to her brightess sides, does not remove any aspects of nature. Meaning that, of others bone headedness and or complaints, to your felicitious deeds, or means rather, and the primary end, of which the path equates, so do these remain.
            <br>&emsp;And the object of modern man is to merely describe this, so he may better be. "Know thyself, for the world will be equal in its ways, by which a centered spot of concern will be met, and true success fashioned. And through the breadth which our industry provides, so will our dormant faculties breath life into the offered extent: to which you fully meet the lane of nature, and earn her entirely." And, to otherwise say, that such is the gift for taking her hand; of which, your place as the wanderer, and the heed which your apprehension is towards, in total, marks the form which requires conception, for you then truly know the whole, and are pushed to the limits of its edge, whereby you blossom as a member of such whole, a man. As a flower is not the world, but fills out as it falls in line. And so will our inquiry and interest compare, to which liberty is our seat: and the base of proportion regarding our success, and confidence to where (and what is and is not contrary) lies forth.
        </div>
        <div id="nowfree">
            So, are we waiting to live? In some sense yes, as our cares of provision are but dangling there till a more suitable scenario arises. 
            <br>&emsp;This seems fine, but moreose seems an issue. For what are you doing now, if not literally living? Well, the truth lies in what we actually seek, which is not so much of our occupation, but our life. Indeed there are things which I see ahead but am not working towards now. But the flow of our life is such, that those objects are not the entirety of me; but mere regards for selection, like a task or addition to your life. I am simply not making the task of doing it now.
            <br>&emsp;Our life holds apprehension though. Nor is our timely understanding an anwser, as if alignment is what we seek, and souly care for. No. This amounts to congruency, but not living. For you see, living, is done with an open mind, a steady eye. And as drunkenss removes this, and sobriety is its contrast, so is your ovearll fitting to life a remark of your state; and by that, woven so based on your understanding, or clarity rather, of the world (including you). And from that, it is more like a continous point on a wave, with a peak which is flat, and a base which is gloopy. Our arrangment is best when were solid, taught, clear and tender. And from this, as if a mark of your vision and its sharpness, you see, mightily, on the path your own. Which indeed marks the care for constancy, as your ability to fully see yeilds results according to your progression; which is a conceptual notion, or matter of marks, as upon one bit of sight, so is the subject then further seen, if only because what your seeing is better knonw, and familiar; and from there, more about it, 'it' being now expanded, can grow: which is a continuing process. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps our movements are such as to be ill defined, in terms of our constant state within clear vision, or a rich pace through the lane of living. I can't say, for there seems a need of purpose, or understanding with mentioned paramaters. I think, maybe, that as much as these regards are to do with our humanity, and not so much knowledge, in a whole sense, that our basis for action and concern would source itself from our humanity; and at that, discern and in effect shape the observer, by our human expereince, and what it means for me, and who I am thus, through that integral constance.
            <br>&emsp;In some way, knowledge is entire, as it is bound to what we can no further contend:  namely that which is entire. But I would say, that the scheme for inauguration to a firm and tender pace of living, is so as to perhaps be but bolder, in amplitude maybe, for the purposes of that knowledge; while, holding the form, but scaled appropraitely, so does our humanity lay. And perhaps the greatest philospohy of all, is in holding such timeless insight in order to be so small, but thereby reach further. "Man ought to be bold enough to be himself, and not get sucked into reaching ahead; whereby the ends become cemented, despite life moving on: a strain for one still in fact living."
        </div>
        <div id="rungsofprogeny">
            Right and wrong seem an awkward thing; for the basis of things can never be sure enough, as to offer a platform for such truths to sprout from.
            <br>&emsp;Yet, as a man, of humanity, and a member in associtation, I see how we are in the ways relevant to our portion of that basis; at least the part of it which has sprouted into our neck of the woods. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, I can speak only to what is sufficient, and what proficeincy would treat. But, as remarks the truth in the matter, so is it our concern to harmonize our mind with that of reality, as to be fully part of it, and flow. This is truly the concern of our lives. And by the tenants of language and behaviour, and the mere attempt to solve a riddle or problem, so are these elements of sufficeincy but more complex issues; and at that, pitched on the basis of thngs, or truths which our sufficinecy can apply from. As the former remarks a principle, of man at least; while the latter, garners a structure which such prniciples can enliven. And per our discourse, so does the layout of this all require a sensibility to one, and an understanding of the latter.
            <br>&emsp;The strict basics are not in this case important, for their belief in continuity is but a fair and accepted status of things, by which our detailed regards can particularly apply. 
            <br>&emsp;But as remarks sufficeincy, our understanding is sweltered by our own experience and its ambigious care for real living; to which proficeincy, or further provisional effort, is not so clearly staked upon. In other words, one side sees more which can be earned, to which provision becomes a higher concner; while the measure of living, and its more or less disregard for provision, makes sufficeincy truly so, and frugal at that.
            <br>&emsp;This is fair, and easy for me to say. Yet, if I were to subject this to someone other, I could not entirely explain. For one, the aim of living is unclear, as referring it as living is not so definite. Provisions are not either, but the purpose of such is at least more precise in the particulares. Good living does not lack this, but it not so happily stated, as the point of it is not as clear as in the case of desire or possession, but experience and activity. Which indeed has particularity, but not to any strict degree. It moreso relfects a life which is satisfied, secure, and accordingly open to things which the consquent state sees. This we call liberty, in that we life as if we are free; and pursue, engage and contriubte, with no concern of a return, but our invovlement. Hence the notion of living, as you are, within such steps, alive. While concerning yourself with what you get, means your waiting. "When, and if so what, would be good in and of itself, for you not to be concerned about what you'd lose or fail to receive. What thing tastes good enough to be fufilling by simply being tasted." 
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, the candid point is whether or not a point of liberty is suitable, in that one may be unbecoming in their point of security. This is indeed hard to say. But I can say, from the ground up, that not much is really of need beyond nourishment and shelter. Everything else is more or less uncommon, or accessible through the environemt as it stands. At least in terms of safety, the bulk of it is not so insurable by money, but your civil fortune. And when it comes to specifics, they fairly build ontop of this principled model, and not the other way around. For in this sense, we assume the notion of liberty, and the complexion of our response being but of a more postivie and generous kind (coompared to the baser ones of retreat and or removal). 
            <br>&emsp;And the point, is that if someone is at peace, then they will be more open; naturally by their calmness, and to things which are by this state seen. Such sights are considered liberal goods, as they come from secure living. In contrast to this is passion, which is a sort of drag, or that of relief, whereby work is softened through impurity. There is also a sort of discipline which one embraces if their view of sufficeincy is farther off; or, if for whatever reason, proficeincy is more needily sought, for luxury and novel occasion.
            <br>&emsp;Beyond this dynamic though, lies the possible contrition as to whether someone is being nieve or ignorant in their peacefull state. Are they forgetting something? Is their steadyiness likely to be vain, or evidently futile? This is odd, for if it was not, then the principal needs were met. 
            <br>&emsp;I can say, that principle is based on primacy, in that, deeper truths hold core relations to shallower ones. These can be added surely; but in doing, become somewhat ingrained to the principal. For instance, our needs as a man is for food and shelter, and equally for a partner. By all accounts, the need of another person would simply add 50% from our total needs into this three person account. In terms of sufficency, if one person is to be fully provided for, then the extent of our suffieincy must incorporate that amount. Duly, if my portion satisifes me, and my partner their own, then the extra whole which we must account for can be fairly met by increasing each of our sufficeincys by 50%: from 1+1 to 1.5+1.5. By this statement, the specifics may vary for either of the members and that of our obligate. I may need less, .9 per say, while my partner may inherently require 1.4, and our child 1.7. As partners, we would need a total of 2.3, totalling 4 with the child. By that, our average contribution to the whole would be 2; and the increase from your own accordingly varies. 
            <br>&emsp;What must be recalled though, is that however these accounts are determined, they are, ideally, done so primarily with sufficeincy in mind. At least with the aim to establish such point. From there, proficeincy can be garnered, and determined. For we may be fine at 2.3, but require an extra .2 for a car. Or if our aim is to invest in home, then our portions each go up, and so forth. Again, right and wrong determine the neccessity of the specifics; while the accounting for such terms curries us a sufficeint threshold, and that of proficiency. 
            <br>&emsp;Values seem a unclear addition to this, as with all clarity, they would more than likely be a sort of need. Namely, education is a primary facet of children's lives. But what if the proces, common at least, is overly formal, slow, drawn out, flat in industry, uninspired, dissociated from decency and self regard, what then? Better yet, to add to that last point, what if the matters of character, grieving, strenght and purity, are beyond past traditions, and such matters are but abscent; as the past routes are no longer prevalent, and reasonably so, while this account of education does not include these things. Together, a lack of what religious gathering and service once gave, paired with the excess of wooden futility in schools, makes for a unappealing scenario. As it is by my accounts a diservice to withold a childs association with others; just as it would be not to give them a direction, command, insight and station for fitness, speaking, reading and arithmatic. In our time there is something called 'montessori', which gives more control to the student in what they wish to learn; though the details remain a blurr, as I am not sure what teaching is done. 
            <br>&emsp;And beyond that, as we've said, right and wrong may bear qualities and a suitable direction as regards the course and placement of the child; and at that, options of education, in that they are the prevalent occupation of the childs early times, become judged against such regards. 
        </div>
        <div id="bookended">
            So, be it designed and or willed, or merely brought to be, or some other way, so is life, or the world rather, continuous. And however our senses are, so are they subject to that world in its own matter; but our ways and conduct, including language and behaviour, are but details of that. So if the basis for things is contrived, goverened, ordered, or somewhat ill-set, so is our place within that situated with respect to all the things around us, in how they are situated; and, as it were, beyond the basis, that our responsive nature is fair and fine to deem the world as it is, momentarily, and naturally, as our observations become prolonged.
            <br>&emsp;Because of this, there seems to be a continuity, which gives no purpose to prayer. And at that, beyond the mystery of origins, that of our portion of things, so is the majority of it without must ambiguity as being a detail of that; and accordingly, an arrangment within the broader assembly; to which the process of things, in our mortal ways, carries on in newly configured ways; as our sight, smell, hearing, memory, predilections, 'and all things meat and bone' are but part of the weaves of lifes flowing time; and so as it moves on, do we unwind, passing what we have while our sediment dissolves into the forward current. "As is the circle of things; and without much remorse; as all living beings go this way, from breathing upright, then settling into the ground for more to spring anew."
            <br>&emsp;By this, beyond the apprehension of superstition and falsity, so lies the common strides of the world. And our remarks upon it, sit, fairly to the extent that we are in fact natural, with such regards as to be so clear and fair as to the appearence of such nature. For language is an odd thing, as it indeed allows us to delay our response, ponder, and at that solve problems beyond immediate threats. And increasingly, as this goes on, that our baser concerns do not simply become stabile, but new issues arise, such as our place in time, the basis for such assembly (knowledge), and at that the conduct of the broader world. "Its as if the cease of worry regarding tigers gave rise to concerns regarding the weather, if only because we could see more of it, and that in it, more was going on." And indeed, the process of any moment in time, invovles remakrs about strides past; but so for sensibility, as the truth in things is quite constant, and at that, but appreciative for things once discovered, in that their merrits lie now evident, or run contary. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, modernity is a sort of complexion to this process, whereby the strenght of it is beyond the advents of our primitive outgrowth. The absolutes which came from that have merely been regressed from, all the while though we keep our heads turned towards it, and not what is coming in front. For here lies the world; and indeed our attention elsewhere really amounts to situating the validity of such a worlds appearence, and whether or not its evident experession is as it truly seems. As things are natural though, so are they consisent, and born from reasons that, albeit unknown, lie but deeper into the birth of the stream. And at that, place in the assmebly gives merrit to our own ways and their place amongs the evident world. For neither seem but a binding of what is timely and of matter: each of which is formed and carried with consistence. 
            <br>&emsp;The principle of life then, as respects us, is quite relevant through most of our time, and at that usefull to learn of beyond our current period. But of such period lies the roster of querries, or points of neccessary, promisig or possible application. I might say, at the base of it, lies neccessity, which can be best summized as security and affliction. One who is fed and housed, or shield from the weather at least, holds the bulk of the former, while one who is privaleged, by the times, or fortuned enough, as to extract what little there is, remarks the latter, in that ailments are suitably addressed. Beyond this, lies oppertunity, guided by ends which warrant the means to it. And indeed this dynamic is not conclusive, but if the flow of those neccessities are met, then so will oppertunity remark what truly interests you, rather than what relieves your instabilities. And although one may in fact have hold such neccesities, so may their grip be uneven, and coarse. Which brings the notion of excess, as to how we suround our sufficiency; with objects of passion, relief, or interest. Of those three, the first two remark instabilities of sufficiency, in that your worn down by them and desire relief, or are unfulfulled by the, bringing on passions, or dreams rather or riper times. But then, to that third, in interest, lies what can only be described as steady excess; whereby your eveness and strenght within sufficiency lightens your mind and senses, who then accomadte inputs which would not elsehwere be seen. Indeed this is the overall character of man, in that he sees more upon securing his prior insights. And in a word, those prior two elements remark negative responses, as their source is an unweildly irksomenessness or fatigue; while the matter of interest is a positive response, as your purpose is purely forward, in that you are not spurred by an inner wish, but an outer draw; one being a sort of parchedness, which has you reaching for things, unsteadily; while interests are about approach, in that the gleam of another merely compells you, and you are naturally drawn to it, with no hurry or haste. Passions see you still, wishing to be somewhere, and rushing to get there; but the moment is merely about one spot, with the tension being the seperation from the present and the dream. While interests are about harmony, in that you are already steady enough to give, and contribute from a point already fine. This is liberty.
            <br>&emsp;In terms of specifics, you have things like dentistry, which in a basic sense seem complimentary, as it is literaly your teeth which were talking about. Vitamin A deficeincy would be an actually issue, compared to the hygene of your teeth. Which, indeed, has modern troubles, as our food perhaps warrants more flossing. But still, the importance of cleaning is such as to permitt your care in doing it as best you can on your own. And at that, we can fairly say that a diet and fitness regime which is good in itself, supports good teeth as it is. And beyond that, are the impraactical details, of smell, and grunge. But one does clean, even if they lived rurarally, as some folk do with Bamboo. And at any rate, the facts which determine the sufficiency in this case, hold a significant solution in our own personal care. And, the promise of real dental work may be there, but so is the enormous expense of it worth being frugal about; be it in how important your teeth cleaning is, what you can do on your own, and what dental actually offers beyond that. Indeed, the subject of work benefits comes to question, in that such modern amenities are given, or made accessible. But in terms of optical, physio and dental, I cannot entirely say that their neccessity holds any respect in determining the nature of our work. For eye health, like teeth, is something that, before modernity, was but natural; and, sensibly, the shortcomings of that were mainly due to nutrition. Better yet, our modern lifestyles, in our bodily composure and use of screens, wears upon our eyes and teeth. And because our living conduct is essential regardless of such concerns, then so will the strenghts of that blossom into the minor worries of teeth. And eye health is really a matter of glasses or not. And by my accounts, your health carries most of the determination for that. Nor are glasses the harshest purchase, amounting to a couple hundred bucks. While dental varies from orthodontics to cleanings; and to whichever extent our choice of work may lessen the cost, so is the indulgene of such expense worth only the amount to which it is neccessary. As, again, the heart of the concern really is covered by our otherwise neccessary fitness. We can be resourcefull though.
            <br>&emsp;Clothing is not expensive, as the actual kinds of pieces you need are not what give any common rise in price, but brands rather. I won't even admitt a concern of purchasing such things. As, like toasters, blenders and other fixed objects, so are they high value, one time purcahses. Expenses are generally measured by anuity, in terms of rent and food namely -or perhaps medical. And my sense, is that predicting the price of yours and your childs life, is best done so through principal, reasonable application, and a more or less averaging of what may happen or change. As you do not know your fortune, or privalage at that; for dental may become inconsequential in pricing, besides its actual purpose. And from that, basic things like a toaster or a t-shirt are but the givens of life which, unlike a car or a home, are minor enough -in our simple nature at least- to be taken for granted. "One does not need concern the pricing of plates when opening a resteraunt, but the ovens, the staff, and their ability to cook."
            <br>&emsp;At the end of the day, my place in life is bookended by the sprout of a child; and so to, in our regards for that rearing, would be include all matters which we would provide them with, in their own bookend. That is the whole of it, you see. My fortune is not a concern of mine, nor of my childs. And even if I have it, so is it simply so, a fortune, as opposed to neccessity. At that, our basis is covered by all that which meets our sufficiency; and by pure principles, and their roots from us being a man, so will our child being human, and raised sensible, grant them such means for sufficeincy. And in terms of proficiency, so is this a natural occurence, in coming, by our richer developments -compared to our own at the end of youth, compared to our childs from the beginning. And so at that, the niceities and sweets of the world may come along, in access. But so is their place one of novelty, or pleasure. And in terms of resolve, one may acquire the cheeriest of living through liberal interests, or they may apply themselves beyond neccessity in order to meet their dreams and desires. But ill founded or not, so is such a route, or regards rather in our principle, but to do with proficeincy, meaning all that which affords you beyond sufficiency. And as your sufficeincy is by some means met, so will your profieiency hold an extent of things (of the novel kind) which you can afford. "A man will always provide, and none an really fail at being one. But so is a plumber proficient, relatively speaking; and any can become one, as can any parent support their child in being one. The actuall pracrice, of the long lasting position of 'a craft', is at its heart developed in motion; and at that requires no credit, but invovlement (which is itself lucrative)." And so beyond what we simply provide, so is there an ample means to earning more. And riches beyond that seem but passingly eventfull.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the riches of life come from the goods of reason, and at that liberty. Little is required but the peace and solidity of being a man. And so, my child will be raised: in order to acquire such goods. But our remarks here are such as to fairly place such a reward under pure inspection; as we would not want our child raised to live well, but be insufficient in their ability to be well off. Which, in short, is why I am happy to be so pleased with the active means for sufficeincy and proficeincy. As our family will be fairly set, and theirs later on. In that, we are not forgetting. And, at that, I need not make a promise of our childs superior means, being oppertune for an otherwise required fortune. "They may live their life by their own pace, for its own sake; and earn more as time comes along: but surley for more living to come. [as remarks the princples of value and contribution -who does not, in being there the greatest, mostly receive]."
        </div>
        <div id="baseforneeds">
            So, as regards sufficeincy, the means to it is proportionate to its size. And by that, principal, in a frugal sense, lowers said limit. And at that, our resourcefullness can acommdate the route to proper means, of whichever extent. And, with good sensibility, the effort required will feel just; as, by such accounts, natures demand on you will seem fair; and, at that, lovely upon success. 
            <br>&emsp;It is an interesting note as regards the prominence of our working means. As, the aim for neccessity is such, that in all honesty, the extent is moderate at best. But so may we accomodate ends beyond such neccessity. This is not to be confused, so much, with determining such ends, as if to extend the edge of what you seek, but rather to modify your means, as to be more prominent. This may come circumsntaiialy, as the times may simply offer more per unit of effort; or you may receive family fortune, or some oppertune luck. And, at any rate, the positions we apply ourselves be more fruitfull in and of themselves. The important remark is not to let our wishes wander to far, as to require we find such richer pursuits. But rather, we would be steady enough as to apply ourselves towards more lucrative means; which, in addition, may be more interesting to do. In this sense, our profiecincies may come as benefits from being so sufficient; as our steadyness may allow for riper forms of committment; and at that offer us more beyond our needs, and through means which we naturally acquired. 
            <br>&emsp;So long as we keep sufficiency in mind, and level out its natural need, then so may sweeter things beyond such neccessities blossom. In many ways this is the entire sentiment of liberty. Only, when it comes to interests purely, the purpose there is of an activity and our contribution to it; which is not something related to profiency. That is more to do with goods beyond neccessity, but still in the same realm. Or in other words, our situation in life, in the fashion of it all, may be sufficient quite easily, but may also blossom itself. The creamy outskirts of this hold the whims of passion and remedy, while the lands between hold things of a more common sort, regarding pleasure and desire. And, at the very least, the pitch of time favors all, in that you learn and output more; to which your natural pace will bring you, if not to those comfier and novel desires, but to one's more frugal, as if a layer above neccessity. 
            <br>&emsp;I would describe this in terms of ccupation, in that you are in need of one in order to reach sufficeincy. But, by the times and your ready resolve, you may, in all purity, extent your ends beyond neccessity; and, all the likely as matches the natural development of your occupation, as perhaps comes with age, aptitude and its calm application. For indeed, our life is not simply bettered and realized as we extend this furnished edge, but that of our living. Which indeed, as grounds for liberty in the simplest sense, also furnsihes it by further arrangments. We ought only to remember that the worth of our circumstance loosses itself the further we go beyond sufficiency. And considering the resolutions required for the real goods of liberty, and practical effort at that, so may a mere sufficiency be welcomed, as all time beyond is purely spent on liberty. I only mean that, naturally, and by fair resolve even, we may occupy ourselves differently, and acquire a more common reward of the desiours sort. But, perhaps, this is best said as an addition to sufficeincy, as opposed to a compramise of between further desires and not. So much as living is our claim, and our furnishings are but the sturcutre this is placed on, then so much as this is our care will be increasinagly disregard the extent of such strucutre; as, per these accounts, the worth of it becomes less so the more their is. "For the color of the sky, trees and ground are there who are even ill-sufficient; stability merely steadies one, who fairly in such shortcoming ways, seeks and means to remedy such; but, in consquence, for the peace which the goods of such freedom feed on. For that is the vector for living; while the wishes of passion and credulity merely hold a better platform: but man must not believe that what is to be held there, will come from any less effort. Hence the addage of 'enough', where worth can then be fully embellished.

            So the Aztec were known to conduct live sacrifices, and for superstitous reasons. The former reflects the quality of the procedure, the latter the motivation. By that, a indian tribe who executes their prisoner exhaustively, can be described as savage and ritualistic. As the motivation is not real malice, envy or greed, but the consquence of their beliefs. The spirit of it at least is drawn by a sanctitious attitude, and enacted in a savage way -meaning crudeness, wildness, barbarity.
            <br>&emsp;I only mean to say, that this sort of thing happens in certain way, in a certain time and in a certain place. And from that, the nature or progress, from earth to bone, is but a distributive process which has brought things of all sort into their according place. And at some point, the different in time, place, and proportionate details of conduct, remove my worry or fear, as such things are beyond me. I rest easily though, knowing, that of the misgivings of some supposed action, that it was done so as consquence of the behaviour at hand. And by that, savagery seems less cruel, as it is simply those privy to such, being such. Which only relieves me by not extending my view of the situation, and assuming more than what I literally know. As, being cruel in someones execution, is but a remark of the literal crudeness of the process; and not much of the time, place, or culturat attitudes can be otherwise said. "For man is always rational, in spiritidenss or civility. He conducts himself with a sort of proceducre, no matter of kind; and those invovled, delivering, viewing, or subject, partake in it as such process."

            If I met myself, at 40, what would I wish to hear? Better yet, what would I expect to hear? Concerning advice, I am sure some sensibility regarding work, the course for women and friends, and place to contribute and so forth would bring some proper insight. Which, upon thinking of it, brings those interests into a fuller light, as their worth seems the more evident; and despite their definition, yet current lack of substance, so does their future hold a certain promise; at least so much as we see them, and try.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, what I would ask is proper sentiments and portions regarding violence and terror, the effects of peoples thinking and attitude, the more specific insights regarding climate warming, and that of MAD; along with some sensible findings regarding AI, new devices, use of interent etc. And, in generall, I would ask for a lesson in media use, as to avoid the permisucity which our leisure stains on our ignorance. 
            <br>&emsp;This is from the moment. And to be honest, I, in our current place, seem like a good figure to offer encouragment for our youger selves, who perhaps had less to look for -as we had seen less. Whereas now, I have all the cares in the world, and could die happy presently. But, in that, I only see more of our shortcomings, like bad weather which dampen our means to play. And, at that, our current barrier to peace, lies the conceptions of those shortcomings, and the wear they place on our freer time. As, in moments of impurity, we are not only kept from otherwise goods, nor do we simply amend such mistakes and return to a point of frutifull action. Rather, upon the mistep, our new disposition sees the world from such a lens, and at that develops knowledge. "Hence somebody who, in their unsteadyness, gets impressed by the same situation than someone who is composed." And the point, is that impression, or besides that, passion, become part of our inclinations and reproach: as if, in this impure state, our expereince acts like all expereince, in that we learn something, adjust, prepare and defend. Practically speaking, the density of these insights may be low, and get washed away by their starvation (considering our irreularity of being in how they are made, and at that tenured); that, or contrasting insights push them. Which, oddly, is like filling out a volume with one substance, but pushing out a solid object, as opposed to simply whitherhing the object down. As that being said, the common response is one of repute, where we say why an insenesibilitties are ill founded and wrong. Which is fair upon relfection, as we notice that part of our wishes or fear is off. Yet, what I find, is that this then calls for a truth, or at least a compliment to the refutation, 'as if we said that so and so is wrong, and because, or at least to mention, it is not like that.' And an understanding of 'that' is difficult produce. As at the back of our impressive whims, lies dissproprionate views on violence, government, people; at least, namely, things of a broader and (prone to be) dramatic sort. As such topics are the most unknown, in a truly obvious way, but hold the most believed sway; and fairly so. But their massiveness, timeliness and detail, get lost in our furried minds. And considering their nature as powerful forces, the error in believing them to be as they in fact are not, holds an according stress and misery.
            <br>&emsp;As for why we wish to tend to such misgivings, or poor assumptions, we must ocnsider how we got them in the first place: namely, our prudent mistakes. For, in being prudent, we are, in means as to bear prudence, and, for the effect of clearness and solidity, open yet evened out in our expression and impressions of the world. Nothing gets jumbled around, nor overly portioned. At that, odd things may come in, mingle around and find their place amidst what we already know. And we may then think, form, and at that assemble with more substance and exubrency. Moreocver, if awry or cheap impressions come in, from rumors or advertisment, the poorness of it does not cause a course defense, as if some poison is getting in. By our common stires, we simpyl pass by; or, like all things, it simply settles, finds its place as it is deemed fit, and otherwise gets blown out. But with steadyness and grace, rather then denial, fear or nievety.
            <br>&emsp;Maybe, overall, the reason I care so much about how I see, feel and think, as that our actions and values are traditionally off. And by our expected interests of association, and fear of being critizcies, or at least feeling embarrased or unsure how to say how I am, so do I solidify how I really see. For a man may live norammly and peacefully; but upon association, tighten up that common view; if only because it situates itself outside the futility and ignorance of common norns; notably, superstition and equity. And at that, I hold no common fears, which are themselves born of cheap impressions and dry judgement.  As it were though, the times are such that tradition still holds its sway. For even though the complexion of things is changing, so is it all along the same line. Different ways to make money, alternative ways that equally overlook the point of our healht. And so, as a boy, in these times, I over-corrected, forming my views and understanding as not only to simply be, but defend it; and, admittedly, by our own ignorance and satiety, acquire. "Which itself borough much confrontation and dissent, by trying to make our ways seem beyond acceptable, but worthy, as to earn and recieve." At any rate, our over-correction saw a blossoming of our values and understanding, and at that produced something beyond content, but a flourishing. And, indeed, this appraoch did not come from soul purity, but a mismatch of juvenile wishes, paired with an dissmisal of common fears and practice. As a man though, I can say, perhaps with a final comment, that my struggle is in really being one. For I am in fact left with a tapestry of peace and well being, shouldered mind you by acceptence and mere grace. But is that what I want, is such suffiecinecy really where I want to be? I suspect that I am afraid not to reach what my less than mature self once wished for, and at that grew to expect. The thing is, that the neccessity of doing so, as if to show your worth is gone. It is merely a matter of you, and the fact which remakrs your interest.

        <div id="jedi">
            So the Jedi have a council, and at that act as the oracles of the republic. Their fear though, is that the senate holds to much auhority over the conduct of things; and this, against their wisdom, troubles them. 
            <br>&emsp;Anakin is having premonitions about his wife, as he did his mother. And indeed, this proclivity of his for attachment and fear of loss, was noticed by Yoda when he was first brought to Coruscant; and, by the common remarks of his age being to old to train, this reason thus begins to exhibit. 
            <br>&emsp;The thing is, that upon letting Yoda know of these premonitions, the advice he is given is to learn to let go, and not fear to lose. Yet the Jedi are doing the exact same thing. In fact, the moment right after Anakin and Yoda converse, he meets with Obi-Won, who says that the Chancellors hold over the senate is to be feared. Then, in part due to Palpatines toying, the Jedi ask Anakin to spy on the Chancellor. Which Anakin finds troubling indeed. As his scenario is such, that he must hide his love for his wife, along with being afraid of how that will go through; and he is in conflict due to this allegiance to the Jedi and their ways; which he indded has shown by prior heroic acts. 
            <br>&emsp;But what happens when an alternate path is offered to him, and the dedication he had elsewhere seems both unlaudible or of interest. For the trouble Anakin has comes from his attachments and the friction this brings agasint being a Jedi. But if the Jedi are not to be respected, then a path elsewhere which reflects your wishes, seesm preferable. For the trouble will remain so long as your commitments conflict with your desire. But if those commitments wain, then so can you go where you desires are treated. 
            <br>&emsp;Unfortunately, the tragedy, is that the path offered to treat such desires was not one truly producitve for them. As it were, without said desires, the Jedi's contradictions may invoke a change of direction. But the Jedi's flaws were never so much that their directoin was off, but their overly reserved ways. Which indeed houses the contradiction, when in fact, as regards their fear of control, they were not reserved. The moral is that they should have been more understanding, and aware at least of their contraiety as to not do so in one way but do so in the other. As, such weakness of credulity, brought someone to an alterantive path with the pure motive to succeed in ways which their prior path forbid. But this new path was not a preferable one ultimately; for the love he had at least. The Jedi ought to have fostered that love, and nourished some sensibility and temperence as to keep it moderate and in check. But the strenuous reproach led Anakin to take another hand, if only because there was nowhere else to go. "Hence the susceptibility of those afraid in turning to the dark side."
            <br>&emsp;<br>&emsp;So, the committment to the Jedi is a strong one, as the purpose of it seems preferable. As Anakin says, 'the Sith draw on passion to treat their selfish desires, while the Jedi are compassionate in their selflessness'. And indeed, the latter is preferable. Only, what if the Jedi are questionable as to thir selflissness? Maybe their lack of being so isnt a warrant to become selifish. Only, what if the thing preventing you from doing so is a dedication to being selfless, as if its a responsability -in this case pulling against your desire. 
            <br>&emsp;The sith corrupt those who are keen to join them, promising great bounty, when in fact there is only pain. At least their rewards have a cost. The mistake of the Jedi is in their flaws, and how the greedy nature of the sith merely exposes that, saying, in effect, that one ought not worry about being selfish, when all in fact are.
            <br>&emsp;That is the trouble you see, when your principles are inherited and strict. Any contraiety to that breaks the credulity, and theres no natural temperence to remain. That is what Anakin should have been offered, some sensibility. But the strictness of the Jedi forbode it; and indeed, his emotions were primed from the start, and thus he was in conflict between his obligations and desire. He could not manage one, and as the fear of the other grew, so do his concerns of the the former whither; and at that, comes the great tragedy, that he was drawn into an alternative. The Jedi should have protected him from this. But they could not even admitt the knowledge of the sith, as per their words, 'we would see it'. They didn't even know Anakin was being influenced. And indeed, Anakins doubt in the council could simply lead him to leave and go his merry way; but his fears, hidden mind you amidst his post as a Jedi, bubbled up to a point where temptation took him. Perhaps if the Jedi were more natural in their temper, as opposed to being severely orthodox, Anakin could address his feelings and learn to better deal with them. But trouble was all that lay, in his hiding; and being so confused and alone, a fatal offer was taken.
            <br>&emsp;The moral of Star Wars is that light always wins, for the dark is always seeking, and at that ultiamtely subject to things greater then themselves. Light is natural, as it simply mirors the common flow of things; which even over the might and strenght of the darkest user, still gets blown away. But when the light wishes for control, out of fear even, then so does the practice of the light loose to the meaner spirit of the dark. The source of the apprhension of the light, and their consquent position to be so aganist a dark user, comes from being too orthodox; as one never grows outside the instilled norms, and at that, most become idle and stiff to changing ways. Their too protectice as not to be bad, but in being overly reproached, they hold no prescence, and at that allow more forward users to step in. And then, when their natural fear of anothers complete power steps in, so do they become more forward. Yet, they are blind to the fact that they are even going against themselves. As, the story goes that the strenght of their practices instills a sort of credulity and respect; but lingers over time on pure credulity and homage, as opposed to the fruits of growth and change. And so when time moves on and new challenges come in, all they have are their long lasting customs. And as they are then asked to change, their credulity is shaken, nor are they so fit to be so offensive. 
            <br>&emsp;To which, the moral of life, is be there with things as they flow. For, in doing so, you never are infront, nor behind. 
            <br>&emsp;<br>&emsp;Anakin's turn to the dark side is more of an agreement, whereby his allegiance to the Jedi as no more, and he becomes a sith. He does this because of the promise recieved by palpatine, and the removal of care for the Jedis reservations of that. As Palpatine says, 'turn me in yes, but you are not so sure of the Jedi's intent, what they will do'. And Anakin says he will learn the truth. And when Mace Windu forbids him to come, he pleas, but agrees; as, suspectedely, he doubts their treatment of palpatine, likeky considering the chances that they will kill him. And, by my accounts, Revenge of Sith as a film sets up this conflict well, souly on the basis of the premonitions scene, whereby the decides to heed Palpatines offer. The question, is why 'the no matter the cost' attitude comes into play; as upon his kneel, he abides Palpatines wish to kill the rest of the Jedi. Well, for starters, his arrival at the senate house was not to kill  Mace Windu, but to insure that Palpatine lived. He demands that he should stand trial, and to do otherwise is not the Jedi way. And as Mace Windu acts against which Anakin believed once so neccessary -and as he regrets upon killing Count Dooku- he cries 'I need him', and at that prevents Mace from unfairly taking what he wants. 
            <br>&emsp;Some of the dialogue which follows is important, as Anakin's convergence with Palpatines plans is moreso abuot an acceptence that the Jedi are A) wrong (however exaggerated this is), and that B) they are now enemies, if only because they will be against the sith. The remark as to their intent to take over the senate is unclear, as the suspicion that they will is not so consquent of Mace's actions of killing Palpatine. That was out of character, but not so suggestive of their authoritive plan. 
            <br>&emsp;I guess, in attitude and passion, Anakin burrows into the Sith's side, and at that comes to terms with the opposition which he is now part of: Sith, and their evident place as part of the republic, by virtue of Palpatines current place in office, and that of the Jedi, who are against the Sith, and thus their wishes, and at that, however pilliared, against the Republic -by some concieved notion that they seek power.

        <div id="presumedregard">
            So woke up, opened the outdoor cuboard, and saw a rat in a cage. I don't know how long it had been in there, nor am I clear on his experience. It would seem fair to suppose it was not swell, but I can not exactly say. For I do not know if it was bored, anxious, worried about some meeting the next morning; or if it was merely hungry, thirsty or cold. At any rate, I would not suppose it is claustrophobic, at least by any sense I would be.
            <br>&emsp;But interestingly, as I take myself out of its shoes, and hold no presumed regard, I see how the unclear world of others around closes in on it; as if I must be present in order to shield any notion of avarice or vice. For its eyes are not truly puppydog, nor is its squeels that distinct from others. Oh cute we say, or awwwh, but I don't know why. And as I seperate myself from that, but also don't pretend to know the motions, time or assembly of its expereince, I see that our surrounding views close in. Which, at any rate, brings the value of properly seeing the world; for I have seen that man does not genuinely wish to harm another, and, as of late, nor for animals. And at that, the simplicity of animals is something I don't fully respect, and at that I am reproached into thinking that they are stumbling fools like people; that, or that their expereince is somewhat destined for failure, if only by our ambiguity.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, I made a mistake, in that I did not check the trap till the morning after it was set. It is only likely that the rat was in their for many hours. So, we have reset them as we expect other rats, and my attention will go into checking more often. Shortly after this, during the day, after dinner and before I go to bed. "It is not for the rat's sake, as I have no conception as to whether or not it is fine: but neglecting that it is there is wrong on all counts: and drags me away from our righteous indifference."
            <br>&emsp;<br>&emsp;II
            <br>&emsp;<br>&emsp;So I was negligent the other day, to an effect whereby a simple soul was harmed. A rat was on the loose, and we set some harmless traps. But instead of checking them I forgot, and I woke up the following morning to see one in the cage. The cage was in this cupboard; sizable admitteldy, but more or less fully dark. It was in there for a day. And this upset me, not because of its expereince, by our negligence. For I do  not know if it got bored, was in any understandble way scared; and of the dark at that. But I do know, that if I left it there, that its expereince would be unneccesarily discomforting, no matter the manner.
            <br>&emsp;And I see our views on things as such, that, of a bad theory, it is not excusable for one less sure. We ought solve problems, learn and explore. But fitting holes with assumptions is a false claim. And by that, with the entirety of time, motion and assembly as our backdrop, I say little within our claim. But, so do we fear all but all, as we know so little: nor are others equally ill-found views worth any more. 
            <br>&emsp;At that, wisdom points and tempers us, to which I see what is really of genuine worth. And by that, I see that life holds proportions, of which our observations and understanding cannot elicit. Time can bear us one, but so will our sense always be but that; and all whims beyond hold nothing but an excessive certainty.
        </div>
        <div id="theneedtoassume">
            So there sits a line, which we'll say marks the flow of life, and at that the proper signal of response. Only, behaviour gets warped, or disposed in ways that bring it into a state of reservation or excess. Why each point beyond the natural one manifests is its own detail, but that there is one is clear. 
            <br>&emsp;As I see it, there is a reason to be virtuous, in that you are actually one with the world. There is a sort of credulity and sanctity which comes from such merrits, to the point where vice is not merely disposed against, but fought against; as if it so bad that we must make sure to never reach it. This seems impart to religion, or superstition, as such beliefs hold one to be proper in certain ways, but wrong if they are not. And the weakness is that the treatment of virtue is not so much for us and our peace, but that of a higher power: as if our actions are serving it. Which indeed bellows under the actual form of nature, along with the honoring of it, as if nature was not, in whichever form, some assmebly, motion and timely thing; while the ancient norm was to pretend like it cared, in a anthropic sense.
            <br>&emsp;What we should do otherwise is hard to say. But I will note this lingering feeling that, be it from this or that source, that a great deal of formal superstition that remains, of theism namely, lies in categories of things; which is to say, that beyond the things that are, so do we classify them. Which indeed is not a theistic exlucisve, but finds its lasting remarks there. In general, meta-physics is theistic if their is intent in the assmebly of nature; otherwise, it is but a base ontology. 
            <br>&emsp;I guess I find much distrust in both the output and sentiment of categories; for I don't believe they are much more than concepts born from expereince; and, at that, the root of our current set, is purely from Aristotle and Kant. Physics, Chemistry, Biolgy and all other things, have gone beyond such times, and at that, there seems not much sense or conception which isn't simply an extension of older ways, but developed to fit the current physical model. I admitt that there is some, but my view is generally of those endowed to such model and passive to any abstractions; or there are those who value such abstractions, but derive them, at heart, from such older ways, and merely polish them to meet the newer models. I see little, at least I have not discovered or been shown a truly remarkable set of writings or inquiries regarding a truly modern set of abstractions, as born and produced from our physical sense of the world. "Leibniz to me, merely used his genius to arrange Aristotles and Plato's parts." 
            <br>&emsp;I'd say the crux of modern philosophy lies with those who truly append, but form their own expereince. Our mountains are high as we have seen, rather than that which has been known. As no one cares for classical mechanics, truly, as science has moved beyond that. And at least for me, I don't think all the properties which we deemed essential within our abstractions hold an obvious place in our modern time. At least, I feel like most of them are stemming from simpler things. And it is of those which I mean to understand, and at that, upon ou physical knowledge, inquire. "Is that but the course of a Man doing what he ought to do? Who will truly be done?" For instance, I suspend my beliefs on the basis of things. But so much as our grip on physics is fair, so do we know that much of what we see as complex is really a weaving of baser elements. Literal elements are simply made of electrons, protons and neutrons, and assembled via the strong and eelctromagentic forces. These even or but ripples in their inherent fields, as are the particles likewise (in their own inherent fields). And fields at that are but decouplings of something, supposedly, fundemental. My point then, is that besides the question of nominalism or realism, why not simply remark detail? For, the basis for protons, for instance, is unknown, or its fields and the soul field at that. But we do know that there is not much beyond that; and as blue and yellow mixed remain as such yet producre the phenomena of green, so does the assmebly of pieces remain. This seems less nominal, in that each piece is really not unique. But I don't think it an interesting question. At least, if you qualify the arrangements that we see as mere assemblies of the same pieces, than of those pieces there merely are. And the knowledge we seek then is to how the arrangments find their according form. Which, in an odd way, is something we are quite acquainted with; as the sun is found through clumping hydrogen, planets from the excess debirs of this, life from violent springs in the developing planets and so forth. The farther question is of what we suppose are the pieces and the creation of that. But so are we limited there, and at that fair to only inquire. But, as I believe that if you knew the function of the basic field, how it decoupled into particle and force fields, how these perturbed into galaxies and the constituetn stars, that you could almost literally trace the arrangments we see from that basic function. 
            <br>&emsp;This does indeed bring other questions; but so does wisdom bring our questioning together, as to say, however unknown, that so would so and so mean this. I don't know if that is so, but, the conseuqence of it feel fair to accept if it was. Namely, that if energy was distributed, clumped via the uneveness of this distribution -with our admittence of gravity- then so would the dots of this cluming, macro wise in galaxies and micro wise in stars, than the planets which came about through the later, served as the fair hotsprings for organice chemsitry to ensue, and at that the microbe fossils evdient from 3.5 BYA. The proccess of this is unclear, and that which followed; but by virute of carbon dating and investigative techniques, so is such evidence reliable. "Which we might say, of such evident, that it points to a spot within a process."And of this process, it seems hollow to supect, that as evident as the physical processes are to create the stars and planets, that someting other than a continuation of that to create microbes occured. For one, we either accept or deny the evidence of microbes; and, fairly, attribute our own development as part of that process. And, removing then the importance of us, and getting to the core point, is whether life, or the microbes which are the objects of that, came to be through chemistry, or intervention? And, to be clear, the basis for fields may be so divine; but of such divine, what it produced was a contrinous stream of things, so far as stars and planets are concenred. And thinking that, from the brith of things, that such a divine continuity became suddenly undivine, is suspect. My suspcions tell me that our lack of understanding how the physical process from planets to microbes occured, leaves room for ill set reasoning, as to the potential intervened causes.

            As a matter of inquiry, or discourse rather, we must define pieces. Simply, if we have lego bricks, parts, components, strands etc., so do these wind together to form higher order arrangments. And of their origin as pieces, or so much as the fabric is involved, so is that our speculative nature of things.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, if the fabric and or pieces, has a sort of mindfull intent at the root of it, then so is this the domain of theism: theos literally meaning that which intentfully governs. There is mind you, some distinction between deism and theism, but the continuity of the former does not so much seperate itself from the heart of the latter, which is to say that theism does not in principle, denote a governance which is otherwise willy-nilly. It would be better to remark the nature of such theism, of which deism is but a short-hand which remarks a certain property.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed, the whole of things may be so, as not to warrant erroneous expectations, nor, despite our efforts, a compartmentalized arrangmenet: as if their truly are pieces and an assembly. It is, in fact, more likely that all is comparable, and that as the basis for a piece, be it theistic or natural, so is a less piece-meal domain one of equal basis -at least we may regard it as so. Indeed, the trouble of a basis comes to form, when we see little explanation for all the distinction in the world if in fact all is the same: for there is an evident contradiction to that. But we may rejoice in the details of which our homogenous form ought produce, and that science, or a theory regarding the conduct of existence, is souly on the product of that. "Why, with such universality, is there A) perterbations, as in the waves of a universal ocean, and B) how, specifcially, such waves arise -to which we may presume, or deem them inherent- and that, in total, which interactions occur to create the expontential detail. At that, ontology is a sensibility of origins and form, as to the prescence of material, and our understanding of how it operates as to exhibit complexity: such an understanding marks our law, or definition rather, of something evident of a process which the law suggests."
            <br>&emsp;The dialectic is the coarsest result of man's effort. For, if he is still questioning then is truly not within one. Yet, so long as he cannot remain limbre and spry (in his reasoning) than the contradictions of parts and wholes will arise. Indeed there is some speculative sensibility, as to know the complexion of things which run against universality. But while this sense is offers merrit in being reserved, so is there a forward pitch to our inquiry, whereby we qualify things with more definitive truth, whereby the perpetual determination and concession of the dialectic wains. For the soul cause of such waivering is in the presumptive use of terms; indeed laying the basis for our reproach. All the while, qualities, or intelligible neccessities, form a positive denotion for the basis and structure of things. Perhaps, the ability for their to be both comes from a evoltion beyond the assumptions of the former and the properties it is deemed to contain. "As by my accounts, the prescence of structure is no evidence of their being anything at all: at least, it holds nothing but an insight to how nature behaves. Nature may not be absolute though, and as stucture is but a weaving of such fabric, then so, quintessentially, are such products equally so: and in some sense irrelevant to the discussion. As, per our insight, laws are but schemes, in the way that words are but sharpenings of baser grunts. And, as in the case of speech and cognition, so is truth in things rooted in the ability to speak: which itself is endowed within reactions, and their consquent draw of the subjects sound: to which, upon much subsquency, such sound is sharpened, and at that levelled off to further recieve. As the mystery of all that comes from the latter (subsequence) is but a process understood by law, but born of basic stuff, so is such stuff the principle of discovery: as knowing it marks the truth, while understanding it, merely shows how it behaves: and mistaking that for what it is, tells the problem in philosophy."

            I lack the words, though my prior thought held truth.
            <br>&emsp;The issue with living, is that it seems so defined, yet unclear only because we don't have our finger on the pulse of it. But, at the core of it, despite bearing the most technical load, we don't know. 
            <br>&emsp;And my thinking is that, of our efforts, they are to grow, to really learn and inquire. And the only way to do this is to think; no conlcude or know, but to consider, proceed, refine.
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, all the evidence in the world merely points to what real knowledge must describe:  as such a process is but demonstrated through the evdience of it. And, much of what we think is knowledge is really a description, of how, some far below process creates what we see today. Yet, qualifiying this, what we see to day is not much more than the arranmgnets of basic things; and at that, the question is not how these higher order things came to be, but how the basic pieces relate. "As it just becomes, in general, a matter of statsitics, in terms of distribution, and a more applied process of which our common inishgts reflect. We undersatnd accretion disks, buit not how the matter got there in the first place; nor where matter came from in and of itself."
            <br>&emsp;On that note, just as we are merely working back to knowledge, but simply through understanding, so does that knowledge, which amounts to thought, earn its merrit by being ammicable to the products of its being. We must remember that laws and proofs are generally higher order, or more localized and shallower than the baser processes below. But, of that deepest process, and whether or not it is layered upon something non-processive, or that such process is the base, none can say. But we can think, and at that, mould a proper inquiry as to what such a base should hold, and how the appearence of nature is as to engrave the trajectory of that process.
            <br>&emsp;At the end of the day, as my clear thinking has become a haze, I see that our inquiry is based on this approach, of offering mere thought and nothing more. I can say that the point of this is to say what things are, and at that qualify their being with respect to things which we are trying to prove; in the sense, that theism is a mindfull governance, but in effect holds no neccessity of a non-continuous life. Nor is it a fair assumption that life is born through intent. In other words, we can say what life is, or the appearnce of things which we mean to prove; but then, through a sort of principle, ontology and descriptive physics, say, that of such explanations, that they may be done thruogh so (ie. theism or naturalism), but that of such explanations, this is all they mean, and furthermore to what they can proport. 
            <br>&emsp;I can see this, really. But I cannot say why else we should not otherwise explore. Like theres this negative of conlcusion and not suggesting; as if we are wrong to theorize and presume the basis for existence, and at that what existence is. I can say, by virtue of our limits via inquiry, that words and ideas are all we have, and that the complexion of this needs a mere mention on the page. Yet theres this tradition and identity, of who we are; and I care little for this. But all the while I know what to do, I cannot cleary say, why theres shortcomings to the contrary. What is it we are doing in that sense, or not doing in our current one.

            So one of the issues in dealing with parts, is that considering atoms as such is too derived a notion. Atoms, are assemblies of protons, neutrrons and electrons; these hwoever, are assemblies of quarks for the former, and at that, quarks, and the electron, are exhibitions of a field; and, each particle is an exhibition of its own field (in kind at least); and at that, there lies an exhibition of a field which acts as forces between the partciles, namely the electromagnetic force, which carries a force between electrons (allowing them to bind), and the strong force, which holds the quarks and thus protons together. There is this modern notion of decoupling, whereby energy states in a field create energy more or less, and at that introduce the currents which will exhibit the forces and particles. Whether or not this decoupling comes from a soul field, and at that is a mere motion of such field, is hard to say. In common regards this field is called the Inflaton; though much research is required on the whole. 
            <br>&emsp;All I mean to say, simply, is that as we discern very little distinction from a planet and sun, that so may we hold an equally small distinction between particles and forces. Even if we took the exhibitions for each quark, electron, strong and electromagnetic force, so would an atom be but an ostensible derivation of such things. 
            <br>&emsp;The question really, beyond origins, is why an quark is bound to act as it does, and so forth for electorns. And, perhaps, why each force is bound to carry its host to whichever end. This indeed holds much ambiguity between the actions of each part, and their supposed basis (the inflaton etc.). But, we can say, despite knowing that such pieces are not truly the basic fragments, that of such pieces, so are they more basic then protons and neutrons, atoms, molecules, and consequently bodies of these. 
            <br>&emsp;Man's geatest mystery is in his suspense, as the understanding of how the earths crust formed, for instance, is discovered through higher order observations, rather than understanding how each basic piece operated as it did. This is so, for despite knowing much of the progress of matter, so is the basis for it still unclear; and at that, why there is 'perterbations' or differences rather in the early progression, and consquently dissproportionate gathering, cannot be said. But in that sense, we can lay with our more or less relevant understandings of the higher kind, while we simply articulate a possible strucutre underlying it; all the while we orient such assembly upon a potential basis; which itself can be qualified, as in the case for theism.
            <br>&emsp;On that basis, my intent in this inquiry is to appropriatley remark things, all the while considering the common conceptions which may otherwise pull against us. It least that which is more popularly supposed. In that sense, as we consider the assemblies of higher things as mere arranged motions of baser pieces, that so are such arrangments things of an ostensible sort, 'or in other words a surface appearence, or detail of the baser nature'. The development though, is that as the sun and moon are within the same realm of things, that so are the working pieces which they are a mere detail for, perhaps too general to be such basis. To be clear, we do not mean so much that atoms are the basis of nature, but rather that they are the effective components of the higher strucutre which we see as evidence; in the way that rock structures form out of whithering, yet are still in fact composed of rock. The question, is that in that case, if we are trying to understand rock, and leave the formation of it as a mere detail, that so is rock in that case not the primary component. As rocks are made of something and so forth. And, as a sort of footnote, that our cognitition, speech and sense that things are real in their higher order, so would I refer to a shadow as being something alarming, but then realized to not be there; which is what rock strucuttres are, in that their form, so is it but our peculiar nature which sees more than what is really there. And to remove that point, we can actually look at what something is; whereupon our deeper understanding can explain how rocks and their structure came to be, and, admittedly ourselves. The truth though, is that we need not pretend like rock arch is distinct from rocks, and rocks distinct from atomic metal. All forms of things are merely chemcial arrangments, and linked as so through the electrogmatnetic force pairing the electrons within each atom; which are themselves bound in orbit to protons and neutrons (or the nucleus). At this point we cannot precisley say where the difference lies between such particles and their fields. But we can say, with a submission to detail, that the combination of atoms and molecules is but a complex of those finer portions: namley the strong and electro force, with the quarks and electrons.  Which, in its own right, is a fairer model compared to the prior basic one, whereby electrons, protons and neutrons were such; while now, the forces are included, the nucleus particles are but clumpings of up and down quarks. Protons are made of 2 up and 1 down quark, neutrons are made of 1 up and 2 down quarks. Up quarks have a charge of +2/3, while down quarks have one of -1/3.  Giving protons a plus 1 charge, and neutrons a 0 net charge. 
            <br>&emsp;All there is in life is these pairings of up and down quarks, held together by gluons (the strong force), and orbited by electrons, which bind to other electrons (from other atoms, or electrons orbiting other clumps of quarks) via the electromagentic force.

            It is true, that the earth orbits the sun, and because it also rotates on its own axis, so does the sun appear to rise. All that is happening, is that from a point on Earth's surface, so is the axis spin moving you away from the direction of the sun. 
            <br>&emsp;Now, Man has created calendars, and sensible times at that as to correspond with this progression. Only, these are but arbitray markers; as the actual effect going on is one of axis-spin. And because of that, so could the markers which segment this process be of any sort. I am in fact no sure why 24 hours was choosen, as 36 or a 100 even could have. And in that sense, hours and clocks are but descriptions of a baser process; and our knowledge of that is deeper than relying on contrived descriptions. In fact, one can understand the Sun's motions simly by seeing its increase in the height of its zenith, and the earlier point in which it rises. It is approaching the summer solstice. And the moon similarly, goes through its own motions. And perhaps, are remark of such motions are such, as to be deeper, and thus knowledgable, the more we speak of the actual motions, and not some conceptual scheme. Hours are arbitrary, orbits and spin are actual.
            <br>&emsp;This is just an example of how our view on things may be conceptual or actual. And from this, we need not shuffle over the prescence of baser questions which our local knowledge sits. As I cannot say why the sun sits where it does and draws our planets motion; but of it doing so, so is this true, while clocks are a mere concpetion to understand this. The point being, that of the reason for what we know of day, seasons and night, I do not know. But, in terms of the subject, namely those motions, so can we know those, if only incompletely due to their own basis. 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, my aim is to say what something is, and remain intelligble amidst our purest uncertainty. Habits and skills remark this in terms of driving, in that, one may say concentrate here or act in this way, when in fact, all that is happening is that the process of the enginge engages so much as your foot hits the pedal, and proportionaly releases fuel to engage the engine. In that, our skills are such as to be as such, skilled, in our operation of the thing. But most people look outside the actual process, of which we are conducting, and focus on the environment, as to say (in this case), when you should speed up or slow down. And my sense, is that rules are such, as if common conduct, but so is a brick wall ahead a clear prompt to stop: and knowing that doing so is more than pushing the breaks is important, as that is not the extent of knowledge as remarks doing that: as their is a process which your engaged with, and in a way as your actions desire. But, if we start to far up, then our aim will be to focused on, and the means to heeding it will be via surface level grasp on the process which actually orients your response. "Our knowledge is so as deep as our action comes from. And I find, in our life, that in terms of who we are and what the world is, that so do norms, common beliefs and presumed concerns, loose their shallow standing: as the depths of our orientation, as to respond with fullness as to how the world is, beckons the view of such world. As police see crime everywhere, or thiefs oppetunity, so does one knowledge of nature hold an according direction to act upon."
            <br>&emsp;Nature is a sort of fabric, with timely and constituent properties of a mysterious sort. This fabric weaves though, and the finest of datum suggest this basic universality. In that sense, fields exhibit the body and relations of particles, and at that the unison of broader structure. The placement of these structures can be traced to the slight fluctuations within the baser fabric; of which the granted effect of gravity creates dissproprtionate assemblies. "The Perado principle as its known." This clumping amounts to simple elements coming together, and upon the densest points, causing further regions to orbit. These are the realms of nebula, the birthing places of stars. Which, begin as galaxies do, in their clumping of matter (hydrogen in this case), of which the central point (where theres the highest density) creates a star. This star, unlike a galaxy, creates heat via fussion, whereby the matter gets so bound together that it excretes energy; and, in this process, creates denser elements such as helium, carbon and iron. Alongside of this,  as there are orbiting regions of stellar material in galaxies, so is there orbting materials around star. This debris clumps together, and upon doing so continiously, creates planets. Of the planets infancy, much is unable to be said. What is supposed is fairly done so, but so are the specifics unclear. At the very least, the principles by which the sun formed are more clear than those which remark the developments of the Earth's crust, the prescence of water (and the atmosphere at that), and, namely, the prescence of life. It is known through carbon dating, that microbial organisms were present some billion years after the Earth's origins: 3.5 billion years ago relatively speaking. And from there comes evidence of a stirctly local sort, in terms of more recent kinds of organisms, and clearer status' of the planet regarding its crust and atmosphere. These remarks are segemented first into eons, beginning with the hellish Hadeon, followed by the water world of Archeon, and then into the multicellular/eukaryotic eon of Protzera, all climaxing into the birth of fish, insects, plants and mammals: the Phenozoic. At this point, the admittence of bones, neural tissue, blood, permiits one to look past the particular motions which gave birth to things such as memory, vision and dexterity, but to focus on these things themselves. And beyond this lies technology, governance and culture: which, comparably, builds upon such prior basis', in that those deal with what it is to be Man, while the civil range remarks our own operations and creative assembly. 
            <br>&emsp;"The basis of nature created atoms which respond to others, and all under gravity; and that from this, structures such as rock were subject to the assemblies of lava and wind. This housed, and at least proported the means, for organic structures to act, and by that, replicate, of which squirells and man are a further development. And as that has created animals, and ones with vision, hearing, smell, touch, and taste, so has such response clarified into words and concepts: all as sort of grunting apprhensions, and the distinctions in that to create the suyllablkes of identity. And so by that, in our identitive path, lies the current approach to the modern world, whereby our guidance by such concepts (as identitifed and spoken) hold a unparrallel communion with other beings of an equal sort: by those who have identified things differnetyl, by their own weaving of grunted disctinn.
            <br>&emsp;Here lies the current quest for true knowledge, as to better refine what we have identified: for that man, the animal, who saw the stars, pointed, and made a different remark, still lives, and in this nearness to modernity remains: he must only, amidst brothers, soceity, enemies and friends, work to act as he sees fitting: and with the operative sensibility to remove ambiguity and contrivance, so as to demonstrate merrit amongst those who see otherwise: and, at that, within the process by which we inquires, so may he listen, as such approach is merely such, and accordinlgy not a process of conclusion, but technique. 
            <br>&emsp;At least, in his certainty he lies alone, for only as such can he make such a outright claim; while all others believe what their own technique has shown them; and perhaps, they have made their own rightfull claim; only, they are all the likely convinced by their own thinking, and to an argumentative end, as opposed to one of demonstration: as such a mark, however incomplete, or unedning in its sought for reach, is something beyond the concepts of men, but a truth regarding nature herself: while those former, who may in fact ardently know, merely do so relatively by others: by which we say that most in their certainty, embellish so through pedantic scrutiny, or bravdo: and at that, hold no real claim than having not which is known: but so then do they lie, in the wake of all others who are equally mistaken. And when we consider why the truth is important at all, in that basic primitivity of identity, so do we see why the confuision of others along with ourselves, merely adds to the stress of being unknown: for so many are equally lost: of which man knows drives violent actions born of fear. But so doth modernity lay, for one, or some, who have the bravery to know that in that chaotic misery, lies an end and comparsion to that which is free and peacefull: whereby we can see, in calmer moments, what reality is like, and make a suggestion which does not come between that rock and hard place. 
            <br>&emsp;All the great men have exhibited themselves this way, going against the frantic conversations of those drug by theirs and others lost commissery. Socrates, Aristolte in his system, Plutarch in his geniality, Auerlius in his post; Aquinas in his scholastic attempt, Montainge in his own modern attire; Descartes in his notable declarations, of others having not much which is worth being known; and Nietzche, who in his own way, knew the world was false, but could not then otherwise say, as his own strenght came in seeing such faults, rather than the peace which would be brought in seeing how the world is. And now, by me at least, who in the most forward grace, settles in on the world as it is in its truly moderate ways: I am like Nitzche though, in that I must work to overcome the blockades of tradition and normality. But I know though, however, that all I am tasked to do is explain why, in our human ignorance, that the actual world which houses us does not exhibit much more than our truest claim. Of which, my toil, is in describing the realities of which our cynical view on the world may suppose; in that, if people are wrong and stupid, then so will violence, torture, destitude and crime be like this: all  the while I know, and can plainly speak, to these being the fact, as the real world produces, rather than our own wobbled view of other peoples being. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, and where I am different than Nitzche, is that this false view which I am bent to retort, comes from our own belidgerance to nature and her truth: and, particualry, to the specifics of our human life as pertains to the principles by which nature works by. And, of that, so is our increasingly prevalent place within that true view of entirety, one which knnows that the suggestion of our otherwise filly is wrong. And only do I struggle and cry, when I see the eveness of mans harsh gratuity; with the purpose of removing its vileness and putridity, and seeing otherwise as the act of men: whom I don't see with our smeared eye. And of that, I can only say, that within life, nature draws, asks, and offers plenty as we respond. But so much as we do not, and to a critically severe and superstitious degree, must we remove the cankerous view of those subjects who are invincible in their putridity, so much as our sluggish mind sees them as true. Our grace in nature holds no such view, while our insobriety to it holds a wanderous glare, of which our dispotiont to being outside nature holds its mysterioues with such gratuties. And even though the rancour of this all has washed away, so am I left with such stamps and hollows, as if wounds by our rotten sensibility. To now, where such forms are not so gratuitous and wretched, but, to my point, of their common form: whereby man, in our dearest dream, dies, kills, murders and flogs, with decent procedure and credulity. And indeed, our own fears are the root of mistaking how others act when known to be afraid."

            It seems to be that laws are only truly in place at the depths of things, and all other movements are but outputs of those. In that, we say the basis of nature is such.
            <br>&emsp;But as regards its structure, there is this primitive notion that common substances are the currators of our movments; ie. in fire and wind, sulphur and ash. And, as it stands, there is a lack of understanding for what things are, and how they are arranged. For, a enzyme, which is a complex of protein, or a pathogen, which is some sort of chemcial which your body wishes to defend against, arenot primordial substances, and at that marks of baser interaction. There is not 'pathogen' in life, but rather an arrangment of baser things which, in the form of the body, responds to the arrangment of a pathogen. In that sense, atomic occurences are but naturally mechanical, but as we'd describe through their complex ways. In the same way that phospholipids in the cell wall permitt cell malleability, and to be in placed in water (and not drowned), so is this so  by the polarity of the lipid and water, rather than some 'figurative or principal' relation between things. In the same way that the heartbeat is not an enditment on the heartbeat of nature, but rather a motion of muscle, nerves and blood. And by that, understanding such complexes (and their processes) comes down to broader developments of natures structure. For, in life's case, there were not always bones and blood; but so though the process by which physical strucutre changess [genes and evolution] so did such arrangments arise. But so are these, in principal and laudible facts, born of plantetary development, and by that the creation of the sun and its heriatge also. Life, you could say, is most notable in each arrangments due to it being like a system, whereby many parts interact; while the sun is but a densifying clump of hydrogen and heat. But so, in this, as bones are but made of bone cells, and full of genetic material, is the suns assembly made of chemcial structures with their own mechanical process. And, at that, the sun is but a cell in the nebula, or tissue rather of the galaxy. And so systems are everywhere: though life seems the furthest order.

            Consider a base field, and its uneven ebbs which proport disproprtionate motion, and consqeunt interactions. This, as understood, may remark a fine theory, or understanding, as to how nature behaves. And at that, we may also, in an ontological sense, see how it cam to be, and produced the movements it did. And, to be clear, in the way that we see natures process in terms of distirbution and arranmgnet, that so would our remarks of the base field be its own description; while the theory, would remark the mechansim, or actual proportions, of how each portion moved. In that sense, the earth orbits the sun via gravity, of which we conceive as a sort of bending of space, and the earth rolls around it (via centrifugal force). But the theory of this, remarks the actual figure and metrics, of which each local motion may be a scaled version. "Gravity is so, as we understood, to be alike on Mars and Earth: while the amount merely changes." 
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, besides the notion of law and understanding, there is the foreing matter of knowledge, whereby we actually see each point, or aspect to the subejct in question, and know how they move. Descriptions remark a sort of symphany, in terms of how they all move and collasque together; while law remarks the details of each particulars motion. But knowledge, as would seemingly be divine, is a sort of sense that a conductor would have; whereby he would have an eye on the strings, horns and brass, so would a God truly, see each strand: to which, there would be no genuine law, understanding or concepts: but each moving strand. And as men, it seems, since we are not Gods, but part of the procession, that what we are best to achieve, is a grip on the laws and assembly which corresponds to that entire being. "As one simply is, in all parts of its being, doing merely so: while we are observers, from without, looking."

            Our understanding of things is oddly sought. I cannot say why. I feel strongly though that it is tied to our concenr of others seeking the same; and by that, the real source are why any of us are curious at all.
            <br>&emsp;On one hand, the polytheisms of the path seem laudible in that those invovled with them, fully embrace the concpets which they subscribe to. One cannot shun their resolve. 
            <br>&emsp;But as it stands, there is a clarity in the ways that they are wrong. And as I'd put it, most things fall in this bucket; or at least hold too much ambiguity to warrant any credible sense. But there lies the issue, when others mistakenly, or with thin bravodo (as in the case of cognition) plea and proceed with a vehement certainty. By the ebbs of location and our common ways, so have all groups of people been subject to superstition, but each varying in complexion. And due to the nature of that complexion, where there is a mistaken attribtuion to something beyond us, and at absolute, so is there a strictness (and according resolve) in folks amends. And here, lies the heart of conflict, as the misplacement of those in the group with respect to that definite truth, seems only mroeso by other groups, who entirely fail to meet the domestic truth. 
            <br>&emsp;From the ground up this makes sense. Yet, for me, an individual who is not asked to do things with such condensed vehemence, what is our actual reservation in not holding the truth, or seeing others mistaken? For starters, it seems that we know little, despite our principal stake. You see, in our current state, we are alone, likely due to it once feeling like there was vehmence to do what we thought ill-founded. And truly so, of our aversion to that, was the wish for and sensibility towards, a peaceful and richer claim. "One of which held no benefit, and somtimes contrariety, to the customs proported." And so by this, our seperation leaves us somewhat concpetual in our view of things, 'as if it is the world amist I'. And from here lies the rot of sympathy, and the pedantic concerns by bare expression. This is not a clear issue though.
            <br>&emsp;What I think it is, is that unless we know the truth, then our place in the world will seem awkward, as so much in our angled content will be seen; yet for the most part indiscretely, and withotu much detail. Our solitude spurrs us to see, as does our enviroment muddy the lens with its plastic expression. But the reality is, is there is some merrit in this point; as we are indeed outside the basic norms. There is much growth to  be had in not pitting yourself against that, or being so outside that even grammar has to be remade. But, so much as we are simply uninvolved with those poor elements, so are we good to know things, as to interest our unhindered intrigue, and bolster against cheap expression. 
            <br>&emsp;Yet, at the end of it, I lie here, sitting in a sensible inquiry, wondering why we are invovled with anything at all? I can say, as one who is full questions not the nature of hunger, that our lack of occupation makes us seek, or at least wish to define, what we will be doing. "As if to ease our hopefull approach." But besides the reasons for our state, I cannot actually say I know of any real concern. And, more importantly, why there is any dispute over your current standing. Seemingly, it comes from a sort of illness from solitude, whereby your world is broader then your working self -by virute of our un-occupation. And, despite holding the principal as to why this causes stress, and its remedy, I still dont understand why we are in this position at all. Why, in our solidute, do we have such a wandering and foregin glare. Is it me? Who in fact seeks but struggles to otherwise settle? Or is it actually us who are meant to offer things, and bring forth some sort of insight for those who otherwise seemed doomed or afraid. Or is it a matter of circumstance, whereby our developments have left us with riches, but no market; and we are then not sure what to do. We humbly see the course ahead, and make some sort of intent as much as time seems to call for change. But so are we then withotu much approach, as time merely goes on, and we see only what is going to happen, but not what is. Are we outside of this ever flowing current, of which a fairer state would be a set of values and aims integrated to the motion of it; or better said, ones which come about and enact themselves with respect to our place on it? Are we trying to describe something which seems natural, outside of the basis for which such nature will work from? I cannot say why now, in our current stead, we are entirely off. Perhaps the future seems so bright, but due to the fact that more of the present is happening. And here then lies some threat of uneveness, as if our inability to be present means that a further moment will pass us by, and perhaps seems alread to have. And by that, its as if were left behind, and tugged at in our desires (for which that future holds); that, or we feel like the lives of those around are ahead, and fortunate in the clearest ways; meaning that while we are all in line, the parts of the assembly can move as they be, while we move ours; but when we are seperated, its as if we have some hollow figure of all the moving parts, as if some implicity to each and everyones ends. In short, the future getting ahead of us tears at our desire and fears, for we feel immoral, seperate, without progress. Only, that seems to be the source for their being a future at all, and not merely a extension to the current moment. At least, there seems no words for the hole which we otherwise filled, with the sense that things were wrong and we were meant to change it; upon which the future seemed to echo the voices in that hollow, and thus compell us to reach it further, if only to brace it while development could move on. Where is this hole now? I can say confidently that its source is from solitude, and the increasing sensibility that our complacent and or impressed views are wrong. Yet, beyond the mere notion of others view impacting the concern we see, why is there a concern at all? Why are we so subject to this world? Likely due to us feeling so seperate, and with a means to return, we see it as something, which by our self assured passion, or somewhat martyress profession, we see a problem ripe to fixed. Of which we angle ourselves as destined and or obliged to do so, and at that valued as much to be consquently righteous.

            What is the meaning of life, is more or less a question regarding purpose and technique. How can one really live, or how is one to live in manner which is full.
            <br>&emsp;Saying that something is meaningfull is a sort of postive attribution, where you are alive, or at least familiar with the according feelings, of which some thing brings. Writing is meaningfull to me because its results are postive, desirable, or simply of want. 
            <br>&emsp;The real question, is why work is not always meaningfull, even if it has a definite purpose. In such a scenario, it may be the case that the demands of the work and the reward, do not fully mathc, in that you feel like you put more effort in than its worth. That, or you simply feel like the amount of work is unneccessary: at least, you may not see that it earns you much. Which, in other words, means that work may simply cost to much for its worth, or simply lack any reason. The distinction being, that earning 1000$ dollars is fine, but may not permitt any significant purchase. At least, the work required may not feel worthwhile for what a 1000$ brings. "One may feel the same about getting 100,000$ for their arm. Or a million dollars for their mother's life." While reason, amounts to the job itself being without cause. Surely these two factors mesh, and often, but the point here is that the works neccesity is trivial. And while a modest chore may feel like formula or obligation, so is ones work a longer committment, and perhaps less meaningfull by virtue of what brought you there. It would be as if you had all the money in the world, then worked an 8 hour shift; where one side of things would see you exepmtp from an otheriwse notion where the amount that it got you was important, as your need to be there was ceratin, if only because you had nothing as is; while in this case, besides the superfluous need, so would being on the job just feel like a waste of time. "As you werent seeking benefit or enjoyment."
            At any rate, one may find that there are no real problems, and at that can act on things they find meaningfull. Chores and jobs may not be so meaningfull, in their excess or enjoyment, but so is one in need without the luxury to obstain.
            <br>&emsp;In my case, I don't feel like I need a career or profession, nor to tax myself with the according time and committment. Nor is any expected scale of my life in need of such a position, as our own local endevours have room to scale themselves to mee those expected needs. And as regards how meaningfull the work is, well, by a mix of sensibility, in seeing, or at least valuing, the more humble amount given, so am I free to participate in what I please; which itself creates a sort of updraft of ease and strenght, of which our baser means feed off. In that, work becomes more manageblae because I am happier, in both its meaning (by what it affords) and our enjoyment of it, as our thriving excess evens out our active ability and care within the actual job.
            <br>&emsp;What I find meaningfull then, on that forward front, are studies of the world and literature, industry and its particulars within writing, songs and video; games of many kinds intrigue me, casually at least, while Diablo, Battleifled, Ark and Civ hold me by their playfull hand; shows to and movies hold some attention, though the real care is one of industry; I still derive passing delights in movies like There Will Be Blood and properties like Star Trek and Lord of the Rings. Beyond this, I can say that our meaning is lacking when it comes to romance, profession, friendship and contribution. This realm though marks time outside your leisure and craft, and centers on the lands of your experience. Mine is not spent going to dinners, parties, bars, classrooms, carnivals or concerts: these are not meaningfull to me. Instead, despite our lack of company, my broader time is spent walking in the morning, evening and night, sitting on hills, fields, river sides and parks -scootering to these too- and seeing the hues, texture and expanse of the sky, clouds, sun, mountain and moon; nor do the birds singing and the trees flowing, pass by my eye. My source of worldy venture is found through books by the ancients, such as Plutarch, and memoirs, such as those by Rousseu and Robert Rogers, of which my care for the world, in those colors and views, only gets cemented as meaningfull by its kind, rather than destination. The cliffs of Gibraltor, the sunset near Bengal, or the sunrise near the Yanghtze, are but points of scenic exhibition: it is their elements which I care for though. 
            <br>&emsp;Because I recognize that this peacefull and dear existence is not so easily afforded, or endeared to by others -to the effect of opposition or isolation- I can say, by commensurability and or defense, that the timeliness, movement and assembly of the world, as it is truly, holds much wonder and meaning for me. As, our need for it to be so comes from fortuitous doubts brought upon the nievety of crowds and censors; that, or our own lingering expidtion to other things, brings with it a sort of familiartiy with the subejcts which, viewed in the crumbily common ways, leaks our ability for passion, empathy and being moral. That is, we see much of the world through our study, but have the less definite parts of it get smeared by implications or vitrol of (crowds and censors); and so, by virtue of our curious path, so does our environemtn press on us, by the aversion to its suggestion, not to ignore the truth in the matter, or remain stubborn, refutable and rancourous. 
            <br>&emsp;Why we wander is a hard thing. For do we not already know? Is it really a matter of occupation, which our development can only explain the lack thereof? 
        </div>
        <div id="faultofabscence">
            As a kid, you get what you want; and despite complaining, it is usually because you have to do some chores, and your pleasure is held till then. While, in your teenage years, the demands on you are akin to far development, and at that a seperation from your parents can occur. And, at that, in this seperation, certain desires and interests develop: as either a rebellious response, or ones of relief in your obligations. In that, arugments arise, as 'leave me alone, I am triyng to be me' occurs.
            <br>&emsp;My point, is that in those cases, your (more or less) ill desires are easily intruded upon, especially by those more situated. Yet, when I think of our own ordinary days, I see little which causes intrusion.
            <br>&emsp;What I am trying to inquire about, is one's wish for an absence of duty, as to then feel free and unhindered. Happiness too, is a mark of things being fine, in that we are undisturbed. 
            <br>&emsp;Where I get some confusion, is to the movtives which feel prominent when our happiness is present. Is it mere peace we seek, or the freedom to expereince what we desire? I think depression is a mark of happiness paired with no desire: for the small amount we seek is so easily undisturbed, that us being free as such makes our apparent lack of desire all the more present.
            <br>&emsp;All Im getting at is that there are so many small obstructions to our life. The idea is a little unclear, and at that, lots of money and its use for fun seem hard to compare. What we are trying wonder about is wonderous joy, and how it has so many frictions. For, be it through discpline, luck, fortune or begruderygy, so is that fun life one which affords 'things', and at that a catered experience. "Money earns one the luxury of being so catered." While joy requires one to be present themselves, and moresoe as much joy is to be expereinced. In that, we can say that joy is a choice, due to its flavor; that, or it is of neccessity, because we have no fortune. 
            <br>&emsp;The question I have asked myself, is whether it makes sense to discipline one's self to get money in order to have your experincec catered for you? Or if we should handle it ourself, and disicpline ourselves for that.
            <br>&emsp;For it being the latter means that there are so many obtrusions, mighty and small. While money, hwoever hard to acquire, has some definite means, and equally definite ends. The worth of that is hard to say, as the alternative may simply be a different kind, of which we choose. That, or we may say that fun, and its means through money, sit in life, and at that afford the fun within such domain. And that by that, wisdom, which we may see confidnelty rests on the qualitites which pertain to the whole of our life, pays according attention. And fun isnt to be divested from, nor its means. But what is to be regarded may in fact direct us elsewhere. Yet, in this all, comes that question, of joy, in its source amidst our whole lives, and how its priority, as if a well of fresh fruit compared to savoury festivities, is hard to say. 
            <br>&emsp;Maybe the highest point, and our judgement, is that joy is best pursued amidst the whole of your life, for in your address of the latter so does the means for the former come; while concerning yourself with fun, tends to ignore, and in many ways run contrary, to that whole life.

            Life has always had problems, as indeed that is the core of its nature: to survive. And happiness then, or flourishing, comes when such problems are removed, or dealt with at least. But as in all things, conflict occurs in order to solve such problems; and in the case of Man, so are their frequent disputes over what problems there is. 
            <br>&emsp;A sheep acts like all others; and even if a young one held no notion of it, so would they hold no means to question and refrain. And, in many ways, that is what learning is for, in that you do what others appear to do around you.
            <br>&emsp;Man is not entirely different. Though, his particular developments lead to a sort of conduct, which albeit shared, finds a very surface level complexion which differs from those in different localles.
            <br>&emsp;Essentially, man is religious, in that he points to things which his freedom provides. But so is this process of definement, as one would more innately do upon hearing a sound behind, is not at all discretionate, or procedural. Instead, the superstitious coloring of such ways gets substantiated in all varieties of sorts, if only by the varied elements which draw such insight. Those in the tropics will have more relations with hurricanes than those in the northpole, who, uniquely, will have relations with the Aurora. And, accordingly, but the common process of idolatry, so do those elements take on such a form. 
            <br>&emsp;Beyond the vastness which Man inhabits, and at that finds other men relatively foreign, the core conflict of our times is one of soverngihty, whereby larger groups of people come into contact, and the solidified obessesion of those idols rubs against others of an equally solid kind. This is why 'savages' are referred to as so, partially do to the conduct  of their worship, but so to the 'wildness' of the idols themselves. The Romans are all to sophsitcated, and at that submitt to Mars and Apollo; while the Germans are but primitive folk who submitt to fantastical spirits and pixies. By that, lies a judgement of quality in terms of the elements worshipped. 
            <br>&emsp;Oddly though, this variation in how folks conduct themselves, has been more or less brought into union, by the advents of what universally reflects the world. Gravity is the same for those no matter the localle, nor does physics and the principals of physiology work any different. Besides the dsitcintness of a member, the mechanics of the heart generally work the same for those around the world. And by that, demonological concerns may vary from different folk, while the actual anatomy is the same. From this the world has come together; for even our nearly modern case is so as to be reaching a solidity of the unity we share in regards to our human concerns. And indeed we could make a historic point as to how the solidity of unnatural beliefs have rubbed against those natural; and at that, how, the governacne and sturucture of civiilzation being so imbuded with the cares of the former, so did the changes of such bring with much conflict as the  latter beleifs were adopted.
            <br>&emsp;But you see, here lies the question. And, as to keep from describing a narrative, but rather being kept within the scope of life, so may we say, that as an individual, our sense is such that of the world, so its conduct but a continuing process of operation, and under a evolving set of values; and that, as for us, who merely sees this as so, that so are our nearer matters, of our cares in being a member, a man, so are these continuous in their own sort, but all the while self-determined, or addressed, while the worlds conduct operates by a sort of grand assimilieis of everyones personal conduct: the whole of which, can only be described in generality: while our own steps can be addressed specifically.

        <div id="ourplacesofar">
            This will be an ongoing question, of relfection, remedy and direction. But for now, I can only say that whether or not their are problems, is the actual concern in our life. If there is one, or at least something is defintiviely demanding, so is our response clear, and at that acceptbale. Its when we don't think there is a problem, but are asked to act otherwise. This is why people (who do) care not for the church, or find themselves frustrated with it; as is the same for those in acadamia. And for me, our parents act as though college is essential, but I never know why. They never tell me; and at least the fact of it being a means for a house and car is never substantiated against some broader meaning in life. Besides the lack of clarity, being critical about the matter does not hold it up. Which itself brings the question of value; for as a kid, my reservation in doing ceratin things was because it felt stupid; and indeed I did not always understand; but even as I did, in baser things, so did I not actually agree with them, or find much value rather.
            <br>&emsp;And in that case, my whole life has been a sort of  complaceny to norms I did not care for or respect; but upon holding no success there, I developed my own; which itself came against those who valued otherwise. And even now, as I am accepted, so has time brought us away from much success in our current place. At least, the values themselves are in question; for their basic standing is that there are loose threads in your heart and mind, and at that, in need of attention. The results are valuable to me, but so do we live, and evalute things with respect to this, as if we are amidst such problems. And this has not fostered any friendship, equity or praise. Which, again, I am not discontent to, as my dealings are not but pleasing. I am only beginning to think that of such values, that their proportions are somewhat off, and in need of refinenment. For, indeed eating well is crucial, and neccessary or not, I prefer it. At least I enjoy what it offers, and rest happily on it being somewhat unebcoming to ignore. But so does this not require an abscence from those who act otherwise. And indeed, my discontent comes from a sort of judgment on my part, a cynicism if you will, in that, our view that others care not for these important things, erodes itself into thinking that they are opposed, while it really is just a matter of me being unable to be so different. Our values are hard to explain; as their motivations come from truly different principals. But so is the need for certain things not essential, in that, our genuine care for sobriety is in the wonder it brings; rather than it being itself essential. And amdist ohters, no matter their ways, so can I accordingly be. But this disconnect, be it by our lack of clarity and thus confidence, or some mixture of antagonism, uninterest or bravdo (by others), so do I get defensive, self assured and critical:  as if my unstable position demands me to refute: and due to our somewhat reputable principal, I see them as lesser, foolish, futile. When in fact, the truth is that I really don't know myself.

            I have no princiapl aversion to abortion, the same way I have no principal aversion to pest control. I only rely on the fact, that so much as judgement is involved, and our discretion is to be deemed appropraite, that we would have some knowledge and sense as regards the notion of 'its murder', and the strenght and weaknesses of seeing this as or not so: which is to say, that we should understand the situation as a subject itself, to which we then layer upon the concerns of peoples right to act accordingly.
            <br>&emsp;At that, I would not, if given a child, turn to abortion -assuming a lack of interest in the child. At least, in practice, if I had a child now, my preference would not lead me that way, but based on that, rather than a lack of options. But so, in terms of predictions, and the values which are to be fostered to those coming forth, so is it explciit that a child (and thus one's chidlren) are not to be raised outside of other's company; meaning that, home schooling is not sufficient less there are sufficeint social compliments. I simply think that this is wrong, and not something I would administer, nor encourage to friends or a child of my own. At that, comes the common notion of, 'well I wouldn't want to raise my child in a world like this'; which in its own right seems overly pessmistic and non critical. But the point, is that in regards to preference, so may I adjust per sufficicencies need: meaning that one is compramisable while the other is not. In terms of that preference, mine lies deeply within education, and the lack of profit found in public grade school. Post-Secondary seems to hold values and practices which reflect the truer process and fertility of learning, but so is this expereince later in life: and is not some leisurely action, but one of investment; the worht of which, I can only say is beyond sufficiency; at  least, it remarks a supposed need (by the means it fosters) for a state of sufficeincy which can only be decribed as 'not frugal'. And althought the source for joy as a motive is unclear, so can I only say that 'applying yourself professionaly', and for the sake finances, is not so purely on the basis of 'there being nothing else'; or in other words, that life, to me, is not so linear and homogneous, that being poor is defintiively worse than being wealthy; as such properties are not so essential to the various aspects of life which are in significant beyond the results of money. By that, my preference for myself and those who I'd foster, is not to apply themselves souly, or at least with any sense of neccsity or essential worth, to such finances, and thus to through the means which are primarily catered for that. This is where theres conflict between sufficeincy and preference; as school provides the company one needs, but lacks the richness that we'd prefer. In that, I only mean to say, that in terms of our election to have a child, so do I rest on such preference as much as our circumstance provides. For things happen; and, depending on the scenario, that terminaton or adoption may not be as preferable as sending your kid to public school. I can only say, that in having such preference, and amidst the somewhat unordinary outcome of becoming pregnant outside election or being unprotective, that I can remain as such sensible, to remain as austere as I please; while my preferences find a time which seems desirable. Suffiency is a mere quality of the possible outcome, in that our preference is not so easily met, in that our wish for a richer rearing is not appropriate unless social aspects are included. And, as a broader disclaimer, that having a child at all is not something which warrants tradition's respect, but rather has to do with one's qualified and preferred interest. Which, I own up to in terms of being so particular, and integral at that (as not to inapprotialy get what I seek); and at that, admitt our pleasure prior to such circumstances, where a fair and true outcome was possible. "Upon reflection, this is ok, as the preferences to do with me personally are still highly emphasized; to which the lack of child is not so overwhelming, or entirely eligble -as such a situation would require its own dedication. By which, I am so to me, and happily -for ends at least which are different than having a child."

        <div id="groovesoferror">
            There are two cares I have in this world: what things are, and what they mean. This is not to be confused with how things are, as per our understanding of what something is, so is its purpose and motion but a property of its identity; at least so much as I describe it.
            <br>&emsp;By that, I both trust and respec the physicists and chemists who have found the true workings of the world. And as an ordinary man, my goal is to firstly see such findings, 'as one may do upon a meteroligists insights, whereby they ascertain what is suggested'; and then, consider such ways (or truth rather). 
            <br>&emsp;This last part is a difficult part, for it may feel like we are intruding upon the insights to the world's ways. But this is more personal, or at least more human, in that of the facts regarding atoms and planets, so do I understand and compose myself according;y; equally as those who adhered to the fact of god and demons. But just as the impression of a disaster may elicit a feeling of divine power, so is it in one's judgmenet, or the earnings from a preacher, to conclude what such occurences mean. The divinity is but a truth to the mystery at hand, in the same way that mass warping space is the cause within the orbits we observe. But what such orbits mean, at least, what such events born about and conducted by said truth, to which we particularly amend, or simply conflate with the event in question, bears our crucial regard. 
            <br>&emsp;What I have is a loose scenery of which I can draw examples which can show that ordinary actions are akin to science; and by that, show that our inquries and conclusions are themselves scientific; or are at  least to due with mysteries whcih hold a definite anwser based on our understanding. For one, being procedural, critical, unbiased or heuristic, and, in short, holding the reliablity of your concluisions via the merritably according means, is something which remarks everyday occurences, from our plans to travel and the assumptions that follows, to our accouting of funds and the fidelity to such figures. And by that, I would say, that as we observe a system, and the entire system at that, that so may we ultimatley concenr ourselve with the system of our lives. For, locally, our sun causes the orbit of the earth via gravity; and so to the planets around Alpha centauri. But these systems are in a way derived, in the way that a puddle may cause droplets to spread about, but are but progressive arrangments of that starting body. And my point, is that as all things are more or less universal, and at that guided by the deepest principal (or real process), that so, when we observe things of an ostensible sort, or piece of that universal arrangment, that so are our lives equally a subject.
            <br>&emsp;Now, when asking this question, 'in terms of the world, what does it, with respect to me, mean', some critical sensibility is required. For you must, or ought to at least, presume that you are but an assembly of the whole, a branch of the universal fabric; and at that are an object arranged under the constituent and operating forces, of which the sun, earth and moon are equal. "Them and us are all ebbs within an entire flow." And from this, we must pivot our thinking on the meager point of continuity; which, in princiapl, cares not how the world came to be, and thorugh which sort of manner; rather, we simply care about, as to what was made, and the procession of it all, from back, so far and in process, and whether this is continous or not. Meaning, that if it is continous, then there has never been, nor can there be, in fact or plausibility, and suspenion of reality, 'or the flow' so to speak; and, at that, through our own case, any mircales or similar feats. 
            <br>&emsp;The grundge of this all comes from a comparable problem to science and physics, in that they only define, but meagerly evaluate. And just as that base question of natures continuity is not so ardently proported or claimed, so, in our own matter, is the nature of 'mind' ambiguous, in the sense that of the elements and or aspects which such a term remarks, so are these but factually understood, but through the meagerest descriptive lens. For one, the notion of a thought is not so clear, in that of what we are referring to we only commonly know. That tune in your head, is it there, a real sound, an illusion: what exactly is it. And, from there, comes the fact that, as words are really syllables, and vision is really a compinsation of granular inputs of light, that so are our thoughts equally diffuse in nature, yet, as we see compositionally, so in that way do we think. And this is not a fair measure of thought, or whatever that occurence is. In the same sense, that as a body, we are but tissue, and at that molecular. And besides the words and feelings we actually have, that just as digestion is a process of enzymes and nutrients -rather than food and our tummy- that so is our cognition, however sprung, of a portioned nature: rather than such terms and precision being fully one. As Hume said, your remark of things, be it the properties of an egg, or your inner self, are only done so through the tools at your disposal: which are themselves not understood besides those tools. And if such tools are of a non-composite nauture, besides the concieved form, that so are the means for identifying it (thoughts) or things around us, known accordingly. "In that the granules of our vision can only know the inputs via such granularity." And what seems the most fair to presume, is that as we are granular, or but assmeblies in function and form, that so are others the same: despite our means to knowing this being equally portioned. 
            <br>&emsp;The point, is that as the world, made by God or not but governed nonetheless continouslly, that so are we, in body and sense (a better term for mind) equally composite, or assembled rather, of those weavings of the worlds strands. As there is indeed, via atomic theory (in the real and principal sense -via Democritus) merely atoms, or at least pieces which correspond to that. And as such, cognition, behaviour, recognition, dreams and desire, are but motions of nature's assembly. And, in terms of knowledge, the order of systems are understood with as much complexity as we can acquaint ourselves with. Which is why, we know so little realtively spaeking about ourselves, 'as we are the ones who must personally know': and none follow the effective course of this action, 'know thyself'. No matter, if we understood the constiunecy of nature and her complexion, of which here operations would produce, and at that to an assembly which marked that process about her details and complexion, then so could we see, as we in fact do, that energy came, cooled, formed, distributed, clumped, and like moss on a tree, sprouted life, squirells and us.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed this line of reasoning can go forever, as each slice of the process can be explored. And there are means to assess things on a relevantly local scale -as not to cite the birth of all things in order to speak of something specific.  But then, ultimately, we come to ourselves, and the motivations whhich cause us to concern us with the meaning of all this. And all I would say, is that, whether you fully understand fire and the motor mechanics of your hand, that 'the meaning' of all this, must not be ascertained while your skin is on the flame. Nature, via her continuity, has already sprouted you to be, so do so. And, as I find at least, part of behaviour includes this act of relfection, and at that regards for things outside our immedaite gaze. Regardless of the moments between, we can say, that of such moments they are easily expereinced, or a draw as to 'why must we experince pain, what is it for'. And of that, so is 'that', or it, our lifes of which you are asking the meaning of, that so, in truth, is our birth and death a definition of such thing: and notably then, or commonly rather, the real question of these kinds center on that latter fact, no matter the base of encouramgnet (from pain, causing you to see life and its status, and thus its end). And of that, I would say, that in order to consul that which spurrs you to ask, that understanding the truth at hand will better allow you to address what living means. For the fact of the matter is, on the basis of continuous arrangment, that so are you, in heritage and name, a current in the entire flow: and like a rock, by nature's wind [the basis for death] whithered away. Surely the status of our so called mind comes into question, but so by our admittence is such a thing but a part of the figure. "And indeed the primitve status of our view is one of actually understaning what sense is: how chemistry creates experinece." But no matter, for authority and our reputable sense attenutest ourselves to this, and by that, bears the fair remark that of such mind, that so, in its normal processes, will simply proceed as they do, changing from the course of the form which produced expereince, to a state of the form (in dissamebly namely) that releases experience. 
            <br>&emsp;And where man has failed is in this pointed conclusion, whereby such release is both assessed, and accordingly offered as the matter of counsel, that the mind continues, or expereince rather remains. But, as I can at least say by the proportinate state of real living, that such motions produce in it a comparable (if only) expereince to that which is most equitably defined in our dissamevbly upon death: and that, simply, is rest, and all the peace and tranquility with our needing heart delights: in counsel at least. "But such poetry, wisdom and time, is more or less fair, when picture being colored is one of truth: the fact being, that the figures in question do in fact hold no hue: but that is what art is for, to give such form some vibrance. And by my belief, our need in life is to understand such form, and hold an integrity of conquest which is reputably so, as much as the view of that form is made, and contained. But so, in our heart, and progress and men, can we give such accuracy some color and flair: for who ever created evil from softening the truth? By my accounts, it has been those trying to polish what has, to date, been shown as false: no wonder the limitless counts of equal mistakneess, and conflict produced."

        <div id="coursetoact">
            So the first place to start is the preface, in that, as me, we already are, in that our being is motion amidst this reflective process. By that, our motions are continuous, akin to nature as a whole. And from this, our regards centre on objects relevant to this flow. 
            <br>&emsp;Namely, as our history suggests, is there a problem, and if so, of what kind; meaning one of immediacy, something to fix, or some far off concern, such as a future move, or your late life in general. Obviously, as the farther things go, the less apparent they become: and clearly, a Tiger racing towards you holds all your attention, compared even to some test tomorrow. 
            <br>&emsp;What is important to note is that one may still find lingering threats, or weariness rather, upon those farther (and diffuse) issues. And this is likely so if the present is unoccupied. For the abscence of tigers or any momentary problem (or one that is nearby and definite) will still have one see what lies beyond that, if they are doing nothing right now.
            <br>&emsp;Now, sensibility ought guide us, for actions, to our benefit and need, will accomulate and bear future effects; and through this, so ought we be discriminate to the path and choices we take. But our life is neverthless lived in action. The far off concerns are themselves actions, but of a contrsictive sort. And from that, if there are no tigers, nor any problems to fix, then your general occupation may proceed. Whether that be with respect to something long term, and a step required, or the mere pleasure of being unhindered, and all the according delights which draw your easi'd mind. 
            <br>&emsp;To me, on the whole of it, this is sound as a scale for our life's fashion. And by that, all that seems to be worth remarking is whether there are tigers, problems, lingering debts and fixes, or some abscence of action which our forthought would otherwise suggest.
            <br>&emsp;In that case, we have three sorts of acts. Ones which deliberate the basis for the values and according actions which our future suggests; current actions which are beyond reaction, but of draw, in that your liberty is at your disposal; and, through modernity, a sensible relation of the two, in that our regards for those future cares and aims, ought hold some measure to how we spend our otherwise free time. As liberty may not be so delightfull, but indulgent or rancorous instead. And indeed these go against most actions which are deemed fit for our future regard. Moreover, one will discover that the future truly holds warranted remarks, and as such, so are there qualities to our liberty (or our time within it) which are preferable.  For, indeed, one may, upon a free feeling, indulge themselves and exhuberntly act. But so do such strides go against the currents which will carry you to those future regards. Such regards are not so demanding in terms of what you ought construct, but rather that your ordinary composure and civil progression ought be frugal, in check, rich in liberty rather than passion; and as such, so do the favored qualities of such liberty (or free time) come to be. 
        </div>
        <div id="lightandhearty">
            I can say then, in general, that what your future ought to hold is hard to say. On one hand, the ends of it are undetermined, though to an increasingly smaller degree. But more practically, comes down to notions of houses, finances and bucketlists. For me, sufficiency will always hold us above water, as will any person compare; to which our offspring will be. At that proficiency is a sort of investment, in terms of oppertunity offering you the means to leverage your skills, as to earn higher kinds of pleasure. It is not so defined, but most pleasurs of this sort are occasional, and desired mostly due to their concentrated effects. But, per our life and its drawn out course, so do moments, or expereinces rather, not fit the bill. For it is the constant point of expereinces which makes our life so, and at that, it is the complexion amongst the whole of them which bears us a true state of living, rather than from one special moment.
            <br>&emsp;Besides this, I can at least say, that what we require is little. And, personally, being outside anothers will is quite calming, and liberating for me to do as I please. In that sense, I am paying soul attnetion to the stretch ahead, for that is all I am keen enough to see. All which lies beyond is not essential, and, by sound accounts, sought after based on current dis-ease. "And regarding oppertunity, know that the present always keeps up; and that the approach is more likely the pleasure, while the moment of joy simply passes away: as more potential moments come about." 
            <br>&emsp;At that, I can see that our time is without much strain, notably because we are not holding onto things held by another. By that, we can live as our needs require, but not much more. Indeed, at home or on our own, and amidst whichever itnierary, there are things for me to do. But yearning for, and acting for such things beyond this tend to keep me in suspense, as if some judgement is to be passed. This isn't to say that college, buinsess, creativity or contribution can't be assessed and aimed at. But, with the values that come from your current steadiness, and such aims are but calm extensions 'of one already pleased, and naturally drawn to proceed more', so do we go. 
            <br>&emsp;In that, our liberty is in need of fashioning, as the sights which spark our interest are not so clearly defined. At least, concerning this are our occupation, in that it is what we effectivley do, that so as bearing wains, do we teater it back. 
            <br>&emsp;For methodicals sake, we can split these remarks into entertainment, leisure and study. Responsability is in itself contained, and at that evened out by our real committments -and not those which we year for and or struggle to address. As a quick mark, our exercise is in a principaled state, and really just needs occasioanl reminders as to its content; as we are always going to do something, and indeed the weakness of our schemes ought be addressed; but so is there strenght not always paired with clarity, of our coming days plan that is. And so some itineric remarks hold that -and I can say that in terms of the principal so are they strong. of which food also applies. 
            <br>&emsp;Entertainment  wise we have just finsihed the first season of the Next Generation. I had prior to that finsihed the prequels, and mean to watch the OT. Giving some time to reset for season 2 will correspond with that viewing. Video wise we are primarily watching 2013, and moving ahead as the chronology suggests. "I need not watch ever sessler or patcher; as these were novel in terms of there place amidst the prior year, where all was absent." And so finsihing the year will lead us into GT, which I am looking forward to. Diablo wise, videos are coming out, though my rampant interest is not so ripe. With respect to the game, I am more or less pleased with the season so far. Some of the mechanics and their pairing with our skill level and insight, makes it so the Ubers can't be attempted. But, by our main, and our general levelling and scaling pricniples, we do have the means to play some harder content, and farm at that. The expansion comes out in like 2 months, and along with Civ, information will be coming out at Gamescome this following week. Besides that, Ark was wonderful, and our settings have made working through the lands both engaging and meaingfull. I feel like I could return to our world and continue playing; namely getting our airforce, some wolves, griffins and wyvers, and just playing ovearll. Justin mentioned he wanted to play, so that might mark our return. And as regards shooters, Battlefield holds the mark. I had played for some time, and tried new weapons and was just generally on top of it. Ark and Diablo have brought me away, and concerning our future return, I see some potential fun with BF4, and possibly battlefront. Besides that there is Gran Turisom, Dragon's Dogma, Harry Potter and Dying light which hold my next gen interest. Astro Bot too is coming next month; though, like those others, full price is a hard ask. 
            <br>&emsp;Regarding studies, my life is keeping such things kept. For the whole year we've been reading, and moreso since we got our tablet. And little notions have come from this, in making sense of terms, the place of drama, our acquaintence with violence and older times. From this, there are many more things I'd like to do, as if there were moulds in our mind ready to fill. But indeed, part of our life is very bare, in that we are not much invovled recreationally, and at that trodding along through varieties of activity. This used to make me worn, while now our evened pace still sees some trepdation at the fact that our course of things (at hand at least) are to do almsot entirely with that. It is true that our liberty to be complacent and or at rest is increased as much as our actual life is obliged to -as opposed to forcing another's hand- but so is the pressure to resort to bungledness unless we keep trodding, and through such suitable means, holds our care for study in suspense. As such care is a mixture of real and genuine curisoity, the emphasis placed on our feeling absent from the world, or at least the waivering feelings which make the enviroment feel contrived, argumentaive and grim, all born from us somewhat loosing ourselves; or at least the balance of our solitude paired with our means to be so vibrantly; which, to be clear, gets weighed down due to our nieve forsight, and the consquent fear of scrutiny and contempt in being unactive or at rest. So sensibility does in fact lighten the core of which we may merrily be. And, in that, principals keep us afloat, even if there is not much matter around it. At any rate, our care for reading and writing is such as to form myself; but as I said, this care to assimilate is not purely from curiosity, but reserve and rancour. It is possible, and such a point is favorable in that we are rightly convinced, that such grievings are from the abscence of knowledge which we find to be the mark of our need. And better moments act then as both a source for such marks, or extend what those concerns drawn upon us. In that, my care is for men; not entirely there motions and words, but rather who they are as people, in both custom and chronology. Aristotle strikes me as a key figure who I have too little acquaintence; and Plato also. Seneca, Socrates, Plutarch and Epictetus are like fathers to me, yet I know not much more about them than their sensibility. And at that, our idea of their homes and times is but an extension of our familarity with their words, but not the actual complexion of such localles. Greece and Rome would rightly broaden from this, and at that offer more ample grounds for Babylon and the Gauls to be known. Modern folk sit here also, in Descartes, Hume, Nieztche and the many scientists and mathemmiticnas through the centuries. Artists too follow this line. Theres just something about knowing who a person is, that you get a sense of the rest of the world. Which in many ways reflects the relief which our cankerous curisoities bank upon. Upon that, lies our general studies. But all the while the histroy of things is rich, so are our actual sights on what things there are, and they be, is shallow. And I would say, that certain things here fit into a sort of basic care for understanding, as a device we'll say; while others, such as cameras or computers, hold my concerns in terms of the actual process, or expereince created upon some mysterious function. How does the image from a video come to be, or the audio from a microphone create what is being globally sent. How are stars observed, and fossils known. And at that, what has been most basically identified. I care little for the elements, but nature's components. I.E. the standard model. Which, alongside this, holds the motion of light, the nature of sound and heat. And bordering all of this, in that such a model is the core of nature, that so are we, as inquiries, our own core subject, fully of which, our deepest draw is to the nature of expereince; which, beyond the questioning of how expereince occurs, so is the operations and assembly of vision, memory and hearing most notable. All of these things can, and ought be, procurred, through a organization of interent archive books, where essay/treatise introductions can be catalogued, or biographies at that regarding modern people (or non writers); and the matters of cameras, hadrons and light, can all be discerned through wikipedia. In a perfect world we could read about these things casually, but our actual interest seem more focused, in that our concerns are particular. We care not about physics, just as we care not for literal history; there are only certain, if not specific elements which we wish to acquiesce. By that, an immediate approach regarding cameras, radio, video, computers, internet, light, sound, standard model, sight, hearing, memory, smell, spectroscopy and carbon dating, can all occur via there mere stake of being summarily defined and spokem about. "For my true care is to only paint a better picutre: and these things are but murky, if not, loosely stationed shapes in our repitoire." And as regards biographies, so is this something which you can in fact read. Sorting those out is a sort of library, or 'network': and surely some relevant, if not additional literay readings (such as rhetoric or poetics, or vaired additions of Plutarc or Montainge) can be joined to that.

        <div id="noteofextent">
            I'm led to believe that people desire news. The roots perhaps, are in the natural mystery of the world, and the value thus of hearing anything about it. That, and the prevalence of this fact means that, being current, means your in the know, and thus able to share, and at that be one to recieve.
            <br>&emsp;But the world does not operate so singly, and the news we remark about is usually regarding matters besides the consquent behaviour of us sharing the news. And of that, so would information remark what is actullay going on in the world. The news may better describe current events, but world's status, or composure rather, is to do with information. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, we have electives, administrators, law makers, policies, those in question, already refuted, metrics for race, sex, income, and those of the economy and other divisions of the country: these remark the susbtance of life, ours at least. 
            <br>&emsp;The news is not an analog for this. Rather, people act, or things do at least. And be it the words and or decisions of a judge, or the accidents between to folk who've crashed their cars, so is the news a digestion of the actions of the world.
            <br>&emsp;I won't jump the gun and say there's a problem. For theres an important note of extent, in terms of what occurs in one's city, region, country and the globe. Each of these sections have their corresponding substance, and occurences at that. For me, the perril, and or saturation which actions bring, is less so the smaller the scale. For if there is a foolish official in my city, so am I aware of other cities around me, and our province at that. Even if our town was rot with distrust and agony, so would the world still lie around us. And because we are effiecitlvy aware of the world, in England and India per say, so is the extent of our lives as such. "One's floor may be leaking, but the stove still works: and our house still feels operational."
            <br>&emsp;The problem though, is that as you become aware of the world composure, you realize, that it is a bunch of towns, grouped into regions, pooled into nations and continents, all packed together into the planet. And as our town has a mayor, service people, doctors, restraunts, traffic laws and such, so do all others. Although hearing about one of these bears remarks as to our own localle, so is a similar remark of a town across the world, but a low res image of some object far away. To be fair, my criticism is not on the reliablity or detail of such a foregin story. I only mean, that as the scope of your knowledge increases, so are you suscpetible to sink in your depth integrity; in that, of some town or province far away, you may pretend like its right next to your, or surrounding you at that; when in fact, it is but a puzzle piece far away surrounded by other pieces. And to me, this remarks a weakness of information, in that of our insights to things, so are we un-circumspect.
            <br>&emsp;From this, I can only confess that the world seems fine; as I don't know enough to know what is going on across the fragments of its board; nor do I attempt to know, as that is like knowing every element, bone, local star cluster and premiere league roster. But, despite this senisiblity for our own cares regarding things, which I can say is fashioned by books and experience, it is alarming to me when such sensibilities wain due to our active composure, with the consquence that the 'news' brought to other folk seems too intruiging or intrusive. This is so, for I know that the incident their remarking holds little in terms of prevalence amongst the scope of the area regarded. That, and the condensed minutia of the scenario is not even a robust expression of the act at hand. And so I am left in this space where, if I am knowledgeble, or at least with respect, to the real scope of the world, and at that eased by our confession to this, 'as to settle into our ignorance', so am I fine with others who are not so privy wishing for a sense of the world. Only, when our integrity of depth wains, all while our memory and dispotion stay, so do others remarking about some far off country (with no integrity of depth) befuddle me. For in some sense I believe their wrong. Truly though, our lack of steadyness makes what their saying appear as if it is being conveyed, and listened to, with both more brevity and assurance than their really is, nor is any real belief regarding the world managed. In fact, my feeling is that the majority of people who concern themselves with how other people behave, are those who watch the news, and only have a sense of how peopel act, from that. I dispostion to the real beholds me to others watching the news, but stationed in the world. One never misses work because of the news, nor do they avoid their daily routine. There vote is all that counts; and indeed, our own impression of this and similar conducts, is from our more familiar (all be it second hand and overhead) impression from online outlets. 
            <br>&emsp;Understadning this is important. As, one seeks the news for they feel postively invovled, but also ceased of negativity in their unsure sense of the world, that so, of this, if the broader world is invovled, but with no integrity of depth, so does such 'learning' feel like awkward obssession, and at that a supsicious sign of misaligned action. Thats the prolblem, souly. Not that Russia is acting like this, or some public offical like that, but that people would believe this in its entirety: as if thats all their really were. I'd point though to twitter, or youtube shorts, videos in general, and how watching some of these can get you in a bungled state, whereby your responding, over confident, and irrate. This is no welcomed or reliable state to offer or recieve judgements about the world. "You become like someone screaming 'the sky is falling', while everyone else is walking past with derision, proceeding through their ordinary lives." The newspaper used to faciliate what people would talk about as they went through the world; but now, the media are more like magazines, in that you heed it while sitting at home, on your computer, while watching dinner. And its not really information regarding the state of taxes in Britain, rather some quote of what someone said, some accient on 23rd street, some grandstanding statement regarding 'the democracy in our country'. These are conjectural, minute, professionally assured, and off putting for someone like me who finds a real concern about the world. Thats why they call it the integrity of depth.
            <br>&emsp;I live with our parents, and they are indeed like old folk who read a book while the news is on in the background. My experiece though is that books and expereeince are the real measure of the world: at least, of what the world is and the care to conceive it, so are televisions and digital screens a poor choice. You just scroll, or hear, but never fully recieve; as your brain naturally thinks, or arranges words and ideas, which is what reading and expereince give. Those other forms give stories, enactments, spotlights. But their not in themselves usually critical: nor fostering of you being so. And I must rely on this sensibility of good, in the same way that having a boggy conversation about poltiics is not in itself a world changing or self-worthy event, that so are real impressions, thinking, and, namely, reproach to the mass of the world, but the real fosterings of anything worthwhile, and representative at that. Just the suggestivness of the news, which is aparrent in some cases and only mildly in others, is but a film, a tabloid, a tweet, a post. Theres no words being conveyed though, but imagary, conlusions, an advocate statement. But one must remember that people don't A) simply watch T.V, and B) the news while they are. People watch dramas, reality TV, various news outlets from other sources, sports, entertainment; nor are they unoccopuied by work, eating, their own recreation. Sleep even. Perhaps its this adolsecent gratuity, whereby you are sensible enough to be composed and able, yet overstepped and ideal: not having yet sunk in, and being humbly privy to the whole world, rather than the 'news' which urks you. 
            <br>&emsp;I don't know what to say. My own feeling, which is something that has troubled me for years, is that, having not been privy to the news, and being somewhat well read, never led me to believe that any problems or narrative which the media epxressed was laudible. But that is perhaps the point, that just as folk wish for news, bit from other people, the paper, radio, or broadcast, that so do we, in our abscence of news, despite the sensibility of the world being innately fine, that so do we linger on the plausibility of this fact: for we are in fact not hearing whats going on. And indeed, events come to us by others merely passing by. And our own actions are not always pure in terms of media intake. This is like our sexuality being somewhat frugal, and despite finely, and a consequence of something which is itslef not a perril, so does porn ratchet up our feelings about this, and either make us feel better about the 'image' being seen, but then unhappy with the reality of the situation; the problem being that the reality of the situation is warped by the direction that the porn has brought you. We are fine as is, but upon watching porn, our interests become such, and our reality is not so. And I don't need a pornstar girlfriend, but one at all? This is like watching nice cars, and being disparaged at not having one: when before seeing the former, you held not attention or care for the latter. 
            <br>&emsp;So there is this point about yoour own intake of the news, be it from your own choice, or via second hand. But so is that but waining on what you have no means to otherwise know. For it is but a homely privialge not to here about, or browse towards, some 'portrayed' view of the world. And by that, our sense that something is going on becomes warped. And, like the natural care for news, we feel like others are hip, benefiting from that, or are at least apart of some problem while I am not. Which indeed gives me some awryiness about the issue, as our abscence makes us feel vulnerable, and helpless to change it. Which makes our commrades feel at risk to. Knowledge removes our disposal to this though, and at that, our predilcations are that the world is fine. Through wars even and all that which only our ignorance paints grim. But this concpetion naturally gets waivered, as your 'news' intake is a struggle to avoid. In our current scenario at least. But just as one who is disposed to the world in a problesome way, feels left out and weary at not knowing, so is the flame of our dispostion overwhlemed by a similar concenr, when such emebrs are not so bright. "It is like Gandalf pressuring back Sauron." 
            <br>&emsp;There lies the question, as to whether expereince and reading can ease our steps through life, as the extent of the world mnutely proceeds. Or, as such peace is thwarted, or poked at, that we deal with the throbbing but A) understanding the poke, as to understand it like one woudl with a joke, or B) strenghten our disposition as to be massive itself, and at that less moveable. Paired with that, are our choices; for if we watch crabby youtube videos, than our emotions are excitred; which only makes the more mundane impressionos from our home more unsettling. And, at that, our composure isnt shifted or irkedly sprung: to which our everyday talk can remain limber and upright: all while our real expereince with the world (outside the yammering) is a confident one: as our repor with reason and living, bears truth to ourselves: which in lack, is the soul cause of us feeling off about the views of others. "For their words, however known, may be believe true."
        </div>
        <div id="thebreadthofgrain">
            I don’t care for the news, despite its good intent, for the criticisms and ideals which it presents seem too bare to match the enormity of the world. Locally, I see some merit; but it is not uncommon for ‘local’ to equate to several million people, and at that many large towns. “Not even a neighbourhood is the metric for constituent pieces, but towns themselves -but are they so small?”
            <br>&emsp;And the question then comes to virtue, in that we, as people within a community, have some sort of obligation to each other. That, and as the scale of such community broadens, so do our duties extend. For if we are truly people of the world, and at that one with all on earth, then so do we have virtues of the sort.
            <br>&emsp;The problem though is one of excess. For the purpose of society, whole and small, is to produce what each individual can offer at an excessive degree. “We all put something in, and more than what we could do alone come’s out.” And indeed this is how society has functioned for a millennia. That, and the notion of collective virtue has been around almost as long: for the virtues which co-operation supports, need virtues which organize such support. Both in terms of ample and opportune employment (of each member), and the distribution of each members contribution. Moreover, the act of determination and execution of such organization becomes a role in itself; which has virtues of its own. 
            <br>&emsp;It is worth noting too, that the virtues of each member is in part within their unified nature within a collective; so that those who are hunters would hunt with the collective in mind, while those who governed would do so with their purpose (as governors) in mind. 
            <br>&emsp;In that, we say that collective virtue is defined within the general realm of communal structure, and  each members subjection to it. “So that they may not fret about the excess which they’d otherwise have, being sent evenly to others around. Each member ought have eachother in mind.”

            When there seomthing stressfull upcoming, you kinda sit and relax in reservation, as your mind cant let go of the thing upcoming. When your free, you can act accordingly. 
            <br>&emsp;But there is this problem when there is something known far ahead, but nothing near at hand. In that former sense, I see we are moving; and life will remain, but from those newer grounds. Likely similar, but still ahead, and prone to promise by virtue of it being in the future.
            <br>&emsp;Now then, I am free, without work or anything of the sort. Nor do we yearn for, or clammer against, the course of our life; and at that, hold no suspense over our preferences coming true, nor any fear of others holding my attnetion, as I seek something from them. Theres just no threat.
            <br>&emsp;Because of that, I kinda settle, pleasingly, but also unsuredly. On one hand, our natural care is really our health, and all other things, however unacuqinated with such state, are there to be finely and openly. There are not other needs and desires, while our health feels important. This morning, we intended to workout, but were active prior, and my energy was drained. Normally I don't appreciate our health so much, as our supposed place in the world is such that acitivties help us cope. But there is nothing to cope, and such acitvites have all the room to comfortably be. And so, this urge of yours, in disicpline and claim, can prioitize itself, withotu any distress about having nothing left for those other interests. For we have no friction in being alright with not, simply being as our duty is done; and normally, our itnerests hold enough sway as not to allow that; but their there to swirm around without impingment, and can be with us as we please. This is great.
            <br>&emsp;Another thing is that our moral line of the world feels astray, if only our peace is intruded upon by loud assertions. I must addmit that reporting is different than judgement, and indeed there are elements of the former which I like. But the latter elements make the world feel small, dissproportionate, and doomed to an end which is not critically determined. In that, I am urged to be more with the world, if only in sense, as not to be so overwhelemed.
            <br>&emsp;And indeed this is our state, in that of the currents of time, so do we, civilly, let them be, as there are millions of others, grouped, ordained, subject or in control, by many peculiarities and hues, around me. I may be ignorant and negligent, but the world is not simply over there, while we are here, complaining about it or ignoring it. Its more complex than that. Nor, is man's resolve limited; and the mystery of the future should be somewhat reassured under the appearence of that resolve, in that it is so entire. That indeed is a sturdy position, in that your place is not in fact so immoral, in being at rest, when the world is so large. Perhaps our peace  is more burdened, than situated. And I think that, albeit fair to a degree in the disturbance, 'as one cannot help but be sprung by the slightest glimpse at porn', that our inability to look past this slight scratch, and not be so deterred by the fact it is present (as opposed to there being an actual stain), as such as to remark me: which indeed, comes from actions which, although fufilling, bear myself with a pace that does not accomdate for more prudent matters. "Perhaps in part due to such interests being there as a balance to our inability for peace, which itself comes from our over-disturbance from things, which however poor in nature, are not in fact so substantial in your impression of them. Like reality tv, opinion pieces, or thrilling television, so  is the news the same, in that it holds no bar above you." Perhaps were empty somewhat, and at that tense in our approach to write off or build up, to counter/repute. But maybe our lesson should be formed through time, as to look past the tiniest disturbance, and hold yourself rightly accountable to the peace which your maturity offers. And the knoweldge which is collected down the line of that. "So one may dance a little, or be uprigt amidst the media/bravose pinches: and through consistency, a mistiness to such hits. Where we may be."

        <div id="merelyoff">
            Remarking upon the systems of the world holds the largest trouble when it comes to deciding one's resolve. For we may see trouble in the culture, and our according sensibilities, and at that, hold some angst at getting our remedy known. Now, while this wish may be colored with passion, so is its aim a fair one, or just rather. The struggle though, is that our care for this coming to fruition, holds with it a sort of humility in terms of the need of it, and by that our duty to provide. As the workings of the world, on the base of it, come from discrete mechanics and their arrangments; and indeed, this is what we mean by God, the interlocur of things: and reason is knowing such. But while this principal is in some sense explicitly basic, so is it seperate from observation, which remarks the proclivity of the tides which that principal creates. As we like to say, an ocean of parts, slightly ajar, and in motion, will coallesque, and to a refined degree whereby complexity emerges. And it is by the baser complexities that laws emerge. Nothing, to be clear, is really beyond what our reason supposes, or yearns for, but so in our active remarks, would laws mark the communion of behaviors, or norms rather. And from this there lies a somewhat grounded sense of the world and her ways: the structure at least. It may be so that one sees how such a strucutr, as regards humanity, is in need of that core principal, and what it means. But so is our own sense of whats needed, and the detailed happenings of which our reform attends, fashioned by the complexity of the world. Reason finds principle, and by that learns what it means, and thus what is required, for a thing, and at that where it starts and ends. But specifics come to question quickly, and our reason offers little. 
            <br>&emsp;What I see, is that we are afraid, in that without a rationale principal, whereby our observations ground themselves in terms of evauluation, that the world otherwise seems astray: for even in good fortune, the unprinciapled track of things pulls us eventually away. This is our fear.
            <br>&emsp;To some extent there is truth in this, as a lack of natural congruity holds no stable bar. But so is the actual activity of the world besides this, one which does not faulter without that sense. It may loose its track, and indeed, broader systems may not be so successful, but it is more like a quality of fuel and the sharpness of an engine, rather than being totally off. Moreso, the suggestions of others, which may not be totally of a core principal, don't alter the actual systems in any immedaite way. Indeed, the functions of our life change by our principals: our point indeed. But so does this take time, and to a proportioned effect. To tame your angst, understand the breadth of the world which naturally occurs, and how our principals change that. Indeed there are such principles which hold superstitous and or techincal truths; but so are these like garments which line the active path of our way. A real truth is in fact not much more than a permitt to conduct oneself as the world pleases; by which we can more fairly amend. Indeed we can look historically and see how polytheism and theism held a rooted grip on the culture, and institutions for some time. But beyond their sanctity, and the creepings into the civil parts of the law, so did our lifes more or less stay, as if there were no principal at all. The aspects of military, agriculture, technology and entertainment, merely had the church as a further member of our lives; and an orbiting sensibility regarding the task at hand. Solidiers, by their natural exposure to death, expressed such theisitic views, as did the bounds of theatere and literature hold reverant and bounded regards of a similar kind. This is all true, and holds a similar compelxion to the fears we have now. But we musn't characterize.  
            <br>&emsp;For one, the discrepency of current principles and old ones, despite those latter seeming out of touch, were not so much in their time. The trunk of such ways perhaps held savage and or impractial consqeunces, but so were these shades mixed with a plethora of other hues. In some sense, the extent of such princples in their effect of the civil world, was what removed its place, and at that people's inability to pursue other things. That is the birht of science: not its merrits, but the freedom to observe and research. And this is the mistake, in thinking that the world is trapped unless we offer it truth. Liberty is all we need: as indeed nature already holds us in her bounds: of which our successful response lies, and our living reward. It is ineed a reamrk of the kind of principles which remove liberty, in that there hopes are for things outside of our civil alffairs: and at that a sort of neglect and removal of efforts in that domain occur. While, the contempory view is that our civil lives are but an arrangment of the natural principle; and in some sense, understanding that, as one would wish for sense of any kind of principle, gives us clarity to such a path: and by that, in the broader sort of things, the civil part of our world can appropriate itself. As the prior prominece of principles led the long term direction to ends which were according to such principle: of which we should do the same. 
            <br>&emsp;But as a man, with cursioity and apprhension, you must understand your place as a fibre amidst the worlds strand. And such tapestry does not change in a day, nor in any solid degree outside our general remarks. "Does one death shake anything but its own portion of the whole." In that way, your insigfht into things out admitt the basis for such views, whether it is in awarness of a world there, and at that your cocneptions. For our modern day is full of knoweldge and expression, to which our impressions and stance on the world are high. But this position is one which is easily overlooked as a place which is inundated with a worldy exposure. Yet, there is nothing, of such a domain, which you really understand. As if there were some tale, which by virtue of the times, spoke of all and wide: yet like the legends of ancient times, so are we, despite the strucutre suggested, ignorant of any deatail or truth. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps we need some honesty as to assess and determine the basis for our reservations, how to calm them, and bear them; and then to deliber an actual resolve; one which is based on a delicate view of the world, and not overly drawn out by a thinness to our broad conception.
            <br>&emsp;But I lie here then, repraoched due to our sensibility not to be so ignroantly bold; but by this, more calm in our seperation from a supposed world, and at that, as learned as we've become to roemve such ingornace, not so distraught over the nature of such world, and our place in its existence. Not even the loopiness of the past seems so bad: as all bad which I ever did see, was poor in conception and delibery. Not only are isntances done by and to men, not characters and imagery, but so are such moments vast in number, and seperated by extensive amounts of time. There is no world truly for me to see. And my point overall, is that there is this self righteous, fair minded, sympathetic, and cynically grim wish to learn about what the world is, because there are those who seem to also see it, but ignorantly.

            The real question in life, is how the core workings of nature produce the consistent behaviours we see. Those, at least, can be described by laws: hence their consistencay. But the workings beneath lay somewhat hidden. Epsecially in our contempary days, the awkwardness of partciles holds some contrarety to such consistency, in that these baser pieces appear to act randomly.
            <br>&emsp;What is crucial to understand then, is of this base, how it operates as to promulgate the surface appearence we see.
            <br>&emsp;For it is one thing to see the broader world, and that it acts as those guided by laws; and it is another to say how these laws were produced. As learning so, can remove the weakness of such laws, in that we'd simply rely on them being truly so. For we may think that such behaviors which we dereive from them, can change, as the basis for laws sits unknown.
            <br>&emsp;This is so, for the workings of things, which laws are but a description of the consisatency of it all, still rests ontop of a sort of principle, which guides such consistency: or bends things as to be as if they were in motion through laws. At least, laws, being descriptions, don't serve as a principle, in temrs of why such descriptions hold true: in that we see that things appear orderly, and that some principle must govern that: laws are merely the understanding of the order, but not an explantion for it.
            <br>&emsp;As it stands, as God is presumed in and of himself, so may we assign a similar property to nature. And, as God is pantheistic, or a binder to all things, so can we see nature as such: in that she constitutes all. In that, the quest for man is one of understanding and knowledge, as to grasp the workings of the world in order to weild it, and to digest the sentiments of the latter, as to guide our way: in that the actions which our understanding procurrs, has some broader end which directs it. "One does not need the truth in order to operate a lever, or to see that it offers leverage: but that he should move as such, and for some aim, requires more than the mere ability to do so."
            <br>&emsp;Though, this is a fair insight, as passion seems a natural mark of how we be as part of the assembly: while reason, or discretion, holds more contemplative truths: as if to not simply go as your base self pleades, but to concern yourself with things less apparent.
            <br>&emsp;In that, I see the system of language as a hazzy factor; as understanding otherwise, can illuminate the fact that we are in fact natural and passionate, while also illustrating how reason, or reflection, is but a mode of such being: and at that, describe how such mode comes to being: as compared to a state of fear, and both its cause and effect.

        <div id="betteradvance">
            It may be my privalge, but the fact that homo erectus was once our human state, and eutharians an age prior, gives reason to think that our 'concetpt' of thinking and mind, is but an unprincipled form of that. I cite the fact that savage tribes, whos words are less civil, appear as unclear as the most civil of foreginers, 'whose unknown language sounds like equal jibberish'.
            <br>&emsp;Theres just this strenght in believing that our 'reason' and derived principles, are but overly bent uses of an otherwise natural piece of our assembly: and at that are not so true. "Imagine if I told a lie, and a good one: you'd act accordingly. And if you found out it wasn't true, then your actions would change. And the important note, is how we hold beliefs, in terms of a howeler monkeys call of danager, to which we reply. And so much as a story or rumour compares, we need only concern with how different sounds are understood: the composites of syllables being a mere development of that."
            <br>&emsp;It is important to understand the weakness of absolute claims. As I see it, the mind is like a barrier, which exhibits itself by our expereince in the world: in the way that an incoming stimuli may trigger some sort of thought, or worded impulse (to run or hesitate). And I believe, that reason, as a sort of forced thinking, is but a forward step from that inner station. Only, such thinking is somewhat encased by the world: and so much as that world triggers us, so will our body feel equally outer. Why I think that principles and absolute conclusions lie, is that we reason from behind them: as if, by our inner nature, our specualtive thoghts are infront: to which our mind meets. And this is simply off.
            <br>&emsp;Where I lie, is that if reason is not a means to real principles, then we are  left with a inquisitive advance: one which reaches, rather than one which reaches a given. All that seems unclear then, is the nature of our thinking, its compsitions which we call thoughts, and our senses around this. In other words, if there is no princple, or doctrine at least, then we are left as some part of the world's assembly: our mind being akin to motor mehcanics: natural and physical. And this is fair, however unsifted. But the problem, or thing to clarify, is the nature of experinece, and how such a state of that assembly comes from such arrangmenets. For we know that the earth is but a result of entrop, and that such distribution is goverend by baser motions, and the truth of things at that. If our mind is such, then our actual remark of thinking, or self awareness, the idea of consciousness, needs some further strucutre, as to be polished off into a mere motion of the assembly. For, we know that thinking is akin to language, in that it is a behavior, of which motor mechanics is comparable. And indeed this all seems fair. But were lessening our selves by disregarding the otherwise 'tapping in' claims.

            I could describe our life as a sort of reflection and apprehension, in that of the basis for things which we would propose from, this is not there; and of this abscence of proposal, the world feels weary to me. THis latter point holds a complexity which can only compare to that of our actual proposal, whereby the world would feel definite and thus small. While now, we are not so forward in this way, and at that, some what ill placed, or unsettled. This is partly due to our imagination, and the reality which we've ironed ourselves with beyond that; but also the sense that others believe in what they imagine, and at that, hold no regards for things impressionable which are at heart born of imagination. "As if they conceive of some thing, however normal, but in a typocal way; to which we judge them not on the reality of it, but there depth of what they imagine: but so are we given a dream: and folks around seem thus like dreamers." 
            <br>&emsp;Were simply stuck between being a propent of truth, and the bitterness of a 'typical world'. We are unsituated at least, and never quite grip the content of the former, nor coallesuqe with the currents of the latter. Which, indeed, comes from our abscence of occupation and friend for the sake of such princple; but unnecessarily, or awkwardly at that; whereby your quest for truth is so heavily banked on, that you have no place or time to be even somewhat outside of it. It is the case though, that our priority of philosophy is not an error, despite its congruence with other things. But such things really are whats lacking; in the sense that discovery is a process, and an ever growing one: to which your abandoment of all things besides this leaves you with nothing but a ceasing progress. "Such obsession is remarkable amongst many people, in that if they could only reach there." But we never do. At least, if we could and our inability to congregrate is the error, so does our principled efforts direct themselves accordingly. But imagine, if you were settled enough to forever make progress, and at that merely offer what you've found: for others to find more. What would you do? So much of me is banked on finding, that we'd see a retirement with company as a relief, in part because it is so stark in contrast. As is typcial, what occurs is a man absent of war, in that they have no pleasure in being at home, idle. To some extent the circumstances hold their obsession in finite, and then send them home to be free. But they have nothing to do there. And I'd say our care for philosophy is simiilar, differing only in that we are not serving someone then going home, but ever asking, thinking, defining. It is our natural curisoity after all.
            <br>&emsp;In other words, less you go into the trenches for a moment then return home, what is an actual path of life which is not so one sided, followed by the opposite. I'd say, upon inpsection, that our deepest care is some of the comforts surrounding our obsession, as we feel there lacking. This is hard to describe though, as we are not truly seeking compliments to our obsession, but less constriction onto such point, as to blossom outward and reach such comforts. By that, our grip on philosophy, prudence, untradition and things of alike, is but a portion of care, lingering more gently as we equally float above, where  friendship, romance, application and contribtuion lie. Leisure, industry and care line these things anyway, and seldom take away from eachother. At least, life can feeel quite condensed, as our youth has shown -when we became so obsessed with those latter interests. At that, our development is such as to iron out our prioirities, and give ourselves more room to breath, and by that more space to care. It is true, that if life were ending tomorrow, that blue skies and reason would hold my soul regard. But this sense that the worlds end is closer than it really is, comes from your obsession. At  least, the sensibility which such obsessions came from did so from grounds which had that compressed sense. So I understand. But our choices really are whats composiing me. For instance, we choose to move home, willingly mind you, but also with a sense of being spared, and gave to little thought about the stability and company we were leaving. Even a potential love interest. Now I know this. Nor am I looking to inevitbaly return with either a self aggrandized sense of those elements coming to be by virtue of who I am, or that they are in fact the soul purpose, and are as such in need of preperation or haste. These are younger notions, of which I hold no position on.

            I have never  lacked insight to what I doubt, or belief: only what I think of these things. It is one thing to notice that the orderliness of the world draws one to beleive that such a status can not be caused through an otherwise chaos, or goverened at random. But my curisoity about this sentiment, where it relates, how I see it, is what is so hard to say. Similar to how one's expereince shapes their life, so has mine be brought forward thorugh such mighty inquiries. They come often admitteldy, but are never so constant. At least, their frequency is a like a season, in that it ripesn up, is plucked, then weathers itself down while the soil replenishes. Thinking is just so rough, especially when it is about the basis for the principles in which you can act on. I have been this way for many years; and indeed prior to that were many more where I held no strong opinion besides that brazzen relation with the world. Because of this, I am not at all convinced that 'theorizing', or stitching as I'd say, is so hard or troublesome. Its just a matter of time till the starting premises blossom into conclusions: and doth our philospphy lays. Determing the beginning is the hard part though, and inquiry, more or less, is the concern of just that. This is why I admire Aristotle, for while Empedocles and Zeno were announcing their disocveries of fire, earth and wind, so was Aristotle issuing a humble statement, that of such principles, they ought hold more than such discrete properties. "Our basis is not so without these in mind." I don't follow his conclusions, as indeed his principles were not so correct: in fact he is in one case blatantly wrong, regarding falling bodies and their disspropitionat speed via their w weight. But I respect, and move myself, with the same concern for those starting princoples and their own efficacy. "For it is just engineering beyond that: while true inquiry gives us a mould to build."

            I know I will die. At least, I understand this to be a fair minded prediction, if not sensible awareness of a natural truth.
            <br>&emsp;But beyond that, lies what can only be described as our living time: where we reach such death. For suicide does not seem the path: but, in part, if not entirely, because there is more to do than simply die. 
            <br>&emsp;For one, I have needs, and at that, am quite mistaken to think that any compulsion 'to get death over with' is not born from such needs not being met. To an extent at least.
            <br>&emsp;By this, our needs are more or less tuned by nature, and in some sense, guilded by her own arrangment; at least, as ceratin parts of her have fledged one way, so have we, in our own exhibit, fledged with the means, and according desires, to amerloriate ourselves to such parts: oxygen for breathing, water for thirst, food for hunger and so forth. 
            <br>&emsp;In this way, nature has fitted us, as it seems at least, to find our route to such success amidst those with similar goals. And I might add those with exact goals, as penguins share most of those general interests. But it is of man I am speaking of, and whom I am most fond to share my failures and triumph. The path to them at  least. 
            <br>&emsp;As time has come, there has sprouted a sort of assembly of men, past the minor tribes and or bands who showed at most teamwork in their local affairs, but rather a grand, unified, constitutively ordained assmebly: modernity of which, is a mark where all those which blue, brown or any colored eyes, and skins of equal hues and variety, may live under such rules and governance. "At least, all those who consider themselves men, may hold counts to all others equal of care and aim." In some sense, our histroy of fighting has been due to a lack of understanding between another; whereby men whose values and principles difffer, so others like they do lions and bears: as other. That, and men are quite obvious in their capactiy, and at that, a evident power who is seemingly not on your side, or at least not someone you wish to be with, seems all the more apparent as an eventual threat. "Hence the gain of those put of by the heriatge of the Jews, who seem so unified and vast in their assembly: but again, other."
            <br>&emsp;Neverthless, our past disputes, and ones to yet occur, can be looked past as points of non-understanding, to the effect of each party seeing the other as forign: the response of which in men, akin to deer and most animals, is fear. "And again, Man, as a unalignd neigjbour, warrants more apprehension then even the greatest of bears: for not even those, even with their lesser might, hold grudges or commsiery: of which those suspicioous can compare." Relating oneself to thy enemy perhaps.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, it is clear, with our needs and resolute assembly as a base, that our goal in life is one of virtue, so that we may be and flourish as is required and thus profitable, and of princple, so we may understand the whole world, as opposed to the mere fact of hunger. For again, we have that in common with the lions and bears, but are still nonetheless different. At least, Man seems to understand more about the world, and at that finds much relief through inudstry and his range of assemblies. But, through time and perpetuity, this understanding gets muddied with superstition and orthodoxy. Better yet, prior to this less than primitive stage, there is still a sense of other men being 'other': of which, outside the perverse postive stance, of which all those against are deemed accordingly, but even without any of this, there is still know binding factor for two assemblies otherwise foregin to one another. The positive reinforcement of cutlure and belief is but a sturdier posture as which to contrast oneself with others; whereby it is not merely about the mystery of another which causes hesitation, but a righteous stance of which all those unprivy are co-operatively denied. 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, I'd say that even if we had no proclivity for 'personal/local' principles, whereby all assemblies would surely differ, that we would still, by virtue of their being other assemblies, require some binding factor. Why man cares for his closest neighbour is hard to say, as monkeys live in troops, and grow and live amidst them as such; but are otherwise fearfull of, or hostile towards other troops. Why they are even friendly to anyone at all is hard to say. At least how such a unit ever came together is unclear. Of interest then, is whether there is any similar factor which binds such units and that which, if established, forms assemblies. It may be otherwise though, in that, of a family or friend, you feel secure with them based on your familiarity. While a foregin person simply appears as somewhat a threat, as you don't know them. Which, as I suspect, merrits a bindingp principle as serving as a means for bringing strangers together: as understanding eachother on that basis removes both some of the mystery, and at that the threat. "One could in all promise, travel across the world, relate to someone on even the simples basis, and find some congruency, if not harmony: more than if they had not." And in that sense, we'll say that what man needs to bring his local endeveours into global ones is a way to understand one another, so that, despite their unfamiliarity or peculiar differences, there cares, natures and interests and principlally the same. And indeed science has brought this, in that the truth it provides is one that all manner of folk can agree on.

            As a thing, our needs are akin to other animals, in that we need warmth, fuel and security. Per the kind of animal we are, we socialze; compared to a bear. We are like other monkeys in this way. As men though, we assemble beyond the mere bounds of common groups, but form rather into nations, or governments. As a man though, I am not simply served by this arranmgnet -and all the proficiency it offers- but am indebted to, and, besides my actual service to it, am a contributing member by virtue of our conduct as a member; in that, by the core tenant of 'together and all, the whole is claimed', so do we avoid the vice of power, nor the leeching of the public good -whereby we take, but offer not. Again, our service is one thing, but so may we partciapte (the fair sentiment) by appreciating what is offered by those who do serve. It is not neccessarily my obligation to run for mayor; nor is it but my nature to converse about important matters, of which the subject of 'who will be mayor' and our means to vote will come up. We simply must not take what those who serve give, without the sense that we are not the only ones recieving; nor should we be frustrated by such servicemen, as if their role was to serve us in particular. That is the basis for morality, as it reflects the heart of proper conduct as a man. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, if we lived in a whole without air, or a limited amount, then the basic need of this would overide anything we thought otherwise impoprtant. And, at that, if we truly were congenial to one another, so would our time following the treatment of air, correspond with the fact that others need also be served. At the very least, we ought not act in a way that will require more air, as the spot of others is not to be given up for you. The point, is that whatever our needs are, that such a matter concerns the core of our concerns, and thus the appropraite measure of action. In that, circumstance may arrange what we are to do in order to serve the needs we have. The needs, generally, do not change; but consider a food shortage and how that would require we orient ourselves accordingly. 
            <br>&emsp;Neverthless, the principle which directs us, to which we comply, is the basis for our concerns, and at that in need of declaration. For starters, the whole of things, nature, the world or universe, entirety if you will, is more or less essential, in that it is not but what it is made of, and nothing more. That means, that mind, body, soul, heart and spirit, are not things seperate from this domain. Not even God is. "For what is the world if not God? If it is something other, then what is it?" This concern, along with other near matters, is a target for propositional delegation, in that aside from statements made from baser truths, of such beginning we must decide. That is, inquiry and principle investiagtion, is a remark of our aim of nature's basis, so that we may say, for one, there is one, and, there being so, of which kind, cander and complexion. 
            <br>&emsp;For starters, we ought remove any sentiments which afford apprehension at an otherwise laudible truth; as per our developments, we may believe in conclisions which are favored based on our preference for them; that, or we may understand them in ways that conjoin with other believes, and at that resists any crucial change -on the basis of whats familiar. Notable in this, is a change in our conceptions based on expereince and testing, as to remark knowledge which has to do with the world, and is corraberated by the world in how such statements are propsoed: in that they promise one thing, and are verified by their accurate success. This, in some sense, warrants us, and in some way requests of us, to be progressive in our understanding, seeing as our expereince and testing are continuous. That, or we simply ignore, or be mindfull, of the imperative beliefs and 'evidence' which are rooted in antiquity (and according behaviours). For current obseravtions, relativley old one's even, say that nature operates in irreversible ways; at least, in terms of her physicality, her currents are not so whilly nilly changed. And matters of mind and spirit are one thing, by their ambiguity at least, but as regards the body, or things clearly physical, so are they subject to such aspects of nature, in her physical irreversibility. On this account, Jesus or any other mark of a miracle, can, more or  less, produce the reason and thoughts which correspond with the substance of their miracle; but that Jesus' body stood upright, walked, or that he blinked his eyes -and at that used his muscles- and respirated, is simply a contradiction to the material of nature. If the mind is seperate from such material, then like a echo there may have been a voice looming around Jesus' corpse. But neither could his body have stood up, nor, if the mind is material, or not seperate at least and thus bound to material (as if the body were a host, and through its form), then so would there not be such elements of the miracle. And, perhaps the crassest element to our discussion, is the denial of such an event, which, upon proof and a scale of contraiety, that one's expereince of this (or regards for it) is more akin to imagery: as one would find in their literal hearing of a myth or tale. If modernity has anything to say, then the mind is in fact, as the subject otherwise unboundless supposed, a composition of nature's assembly, and is thus not in fact seperate or beyond, but is a portion of our own assembly -as our mind is of us, not something other, but so are we but a variation of a physical, or real rather, arrangment, as the rock, to which our mind is but a strand of our personal assembly. Regarding that, the 'description', or identity rather, of the phenomena known as 'experincece', or sensation, needs, and likey struggles in being so, defined. But neverthless, like gravitry and particle mechancis, so doth the domain and quality of nature lay. And consequently, there is no qualified reason to suppose that the mind is seperate, no matter if we can not describe how it is real. Our faith is in reason and the according humility and resolve to remain both optimistice of our resolve and inquiry, and our uncertainty. "Our composure in this, like a muscle, will form itself into a dispostion which sees such mysteries without trepadation." Because despite our haziness of how things really are, we can at least, by virtue of observation and experiemnts refined scope of eligibiulity, remain stout and pleased upon our approach to a increasing truth: but, in effect, one which holds no warrant or (beyond sentiment) respect for tradition or 'believed' expereince. By one's liberty, they may spread lies, sell rumours and or hark ill wisdom; just as I may tell the truth, or my suspicion of it anyway. But if one's beliefs and experince are so laudible, as to cause others to agree to such findings and at that a mark of resolve, so ought such occurences be verifable, or at least merritable to the promise which their declarations sprout. Why should there be fear of reform or questioning, if our care is merely for the truth: what would be wrong if someone found a better anwser? Perhaps it is due to the wobbliness in which your beleifs are based on. That, and the fact that, considering the revelations in question, that such incidents seldom serve as grounds to conclude, but confirmations for which you already beleive. And I struggle in deciding whether or not to be polite, but then affirmiative to the conclusions worth any merrit; or if I should just remain suggestive, and merrily illustrate the flaw in your conduct. It is indeed your place to make such claims, despite the fact that my equal liberty is held in content. But I'd only then define the status of man in that he is so nilly in his peace and happiness because of such conflict; and whether or not you are right I do not know; but is it likely that anyone, or at least all but one assortment of anwsers, is correct? Is nature not but her own way, the truth of which is in describing that soul principle? Even on the basis of core physics, there are rudimentary sentiments which say that reality can only be a certain way in order to exist. "In other words, how could there be multiple neccessities, in our domain of nature that is -which is all one in such a place should care about." 
            <br>&emsp;Because what I would say, is that seeing as nature is soul, in that, for our purposes, she is one, and at that, is more or less entire in her ways, and but a weaver in her compositions of which we are some, that so ought we, in our regards, measure ourselves as such, as portionsos of this, and, as a mere atom is attracted to another by gravity, that so are we, wiuthout hestiancy, normally drawn, by which our needs are stated; and from that, as part of our composure, ought we work from such urges, as inspiration at least for the sake of motion, and like monkeys who use rocks to open nuts, or our own bretheren who used ingenutiy to open coconuts, that for us, who's use of a coconut is comprable to the similar task of one's 'sealed husk' of there mortal state, that so ought we equally quest for such solition. As one via their dexterity discerns the contstruct of the coconut, and proceeds to a tool which yeilds success, that so ought we, in our broader regard for civility, happiness and death, bear similar inspection to the construct of nature, as to see her ways, and at that a hole in which we can fashion our screw. For we need neighter a further motitavtion to open such husk, nor the reason to accomplish the task which we found a solution for; nor the desire to drink the succulence. We must simply know who we are, why were here asking about nature and not, as it had been, opening an actual coconut; and by that, understand how such orders of occupation come to be, and the freedom which we'd be otherwise actionable on, if not for other minds around, 'tightening their own conceptual screws, or having their own literal coconuts'.

        <div id="thosearound">
            The world's complexity often reveals itself, simply in the way that our more private thoughts are in fact not so strictly contrasted to an otherwise general norm, but a frontier of various opinions. That, and the medium of conduct alters the speech so much, that despite the homogentity of attide and style, that so is everyone more or the less the same in how they crudely differ. 
            <br>&emsp;No one gets what your saying; and that is mostly due to you trying to say to much. Hearing the words is quite important for someone offering many, and in a forum which does not flourish on such stlye.
            <br>&emsp;What I see, is that people are nervous about the ignorance they see of others, and others listening to them. In terms of politics this seems the case, while in entertainment the concern is more about one's personal view dampening your own: considering the leisruely content in regards.
            <br>&emsp;I've noticed though, that although each person responds rather poorly, or apprhewsnsivly to what you say (since you say so much), that each does so on their own. It seems to be the nature of the medium, and your ill-fit for it. The response though is not unified. Even if someone comments, and another on them, so is this but a stimluated event between the two, and likely to a quick end. 
            <br>&emsp;This may just be the internet, though television and other commentary sources are perhaps similar. 
            <br>&emsp;I've mentioned, or thought rather, that having a principle understanding of the world elicits not only a station for you, but a sensibility about the stance of others. Media, and onnline ones at that, via forums, sparks this abbrasive reaction, whereby everyone feels a threat, and you need to be heard. This is a manic, if not otherwise appropraitey small posture, and at that fosters imagery of the world around. While reading words is quite calming, as the space of your views broadens, holding much, and of less severity and haste. "For so much room calls on equal amounts ot time to make things happen." 
            <br>&emsp;By this, I see how such a life, as fairly seen, bears an insight into you, in that your right place is in fact your quality of life. While it once seemed that we were to go against the ignorance we saw, or recieved; but so did this, in response, elicit an irrational stance on a truly non problem. For, the coarse truth is that as you are out of line as one who listens and speaks with this 'clumped' sense, that so are ohers who respond of the equal nature, and at that not some cohesive force to fear. Its like a civil event which draws letters from citizens; but they do so on their own accord, and at that have but privately expressed colelctive strenght. That is the falsity of crowds, in rallies or concenrts namely. As, I have known, that right outside those doors walks someone with no sense at all.  The broader mechanics of sociabiliy and conversation occurs, in that one learning a thing spreads it like a virus: but so are we not so addressable of such  matters, in ways that eleicit anything but a local struggle. That, and it remarks one's character to be so hurredly tossed by others, and at that, so does there even headeness permitt only so much as seems warranted; and, as I'd suggest, the matter of whos mayor, govenor or executive, is not of anyones concner. Their attention is on A) the response to whatever these changes are, but B) the elements truly important to their lives, namely chidlren, work, friends, partners, interests, leisure. The constituion of their lives is but ingratiated by their cooperation, as to amend as their scenario promises them in order to earn their ends within this assembled means. This raises the question of 'intelelctual groups' or public conversation; as such things feel impactfull. It is hard to place them with respect to the world they speak of, and not to overestimate their place as not being the sum  of that mount. The news doesn't run the coutnry, nor tv or the media. Peopel are watching dramas, sports, eating food, playing sports or games, watching film, at work, driving, doing chores or arrends. The news is like a lingering voice, which however attended, gets molted over by the primary concerns of life.

        <div id="thetruthinme">
            The world is a certain way, and in some sense, a way that remarks how it should be. 
            <br>&emsp;We are social creatures, with needs and a sense of commradery to faciliatte that. 
            <br>&emsp;The world is arranged as such. As death is a fair expection, so is it fair that the world is so broadly governed, and not for your particular gain. I feel like people's actions, be alone or in groups, act as if the world is not such; and we too, in hearing there words, respond as if they mean something outside the real state of the world. 
            <br>&emsp;At least, the world is in success so much as it follows the deepest principle. In that sense, the good which comes from gaming is in fun, and if there is any then something fair is happening. And like those who get upset otherwise, in gaming or governance, so is there a clear ignorance to how such domains are. Games are made to be fun, in return of which we pay. If we have no fun, then we won't pay again, nor will we speak highly to others. Moreover, the promise of fun is something people have to bank on, as marketing may be misleading. If your drawn though, and at that set on the basis of the product at hand, then you can at least look forward to purchasing it, and then at worst be dissapointed. Goverment is similar, in that it is a certain way as to correspond with  our shared means, and at that, what is worth discussing is not that such a principle be adhered to, or in which manner. All concerns are further derived; and seemingly empty if they don't rest at such point of derivation. The world doesn't care if you think its soul is off, for its action as such is so solid and ingrained, that not but those derived elements are even questionable, or discernable at least. Better yet, to speak of the world requires that the heart of it be addressed, otherwise the smaller matters which irriate us will cause a small view of the entirety below to be ridiculed as the source of such a grand hissy. Gaming is similar, in that developers make games, advertise for the sake of those who don't already know or care, and turn their profits into further production.
            <br>&emsp;My point overall, is that a game, a movie, a book, anything really, is not important enough to fuss over, compared to the principle aspect of our lives. That remarks virtue and understanding, and some ideal sense regarding our lives as members amidst others, and how that, currently, is. Its like a movie; if you pay 15$ and don't care for it, don't recommend it, make a post about it explaining the reasons  (as solid concerns draw solid attention), and let it be. If the money was entirely wasted, well ask for a refund; and if thats not eligble, learn, exhibit your sense of what you like; but deal with it at most by expressing yourself, rather than overestimating the worth and or ability to marshal change. Think of a resteraunt, and if you get a bad meal. Commerce varies in practice, but if the meal is terrible, you may get it cut from the bill. Otherwise, if it is just simply unenjoyable, you surely say nothing, if not but a passing remark. As you have no rights to demand anything, but choose how you then consume. And it would be weird to later demand that a resteraunt change. Why the hate? Is it because you want it to be better: on what basis. Did you like it at one point and not now, and feel a sort of loss, and thus motivation to renew. Its one thing to fully conduct yourself for this purpose, be it your cares for star wars or democracy. But of what you are actually best to concern yourself with, so is it fair to remark a nelgect of things more primary if your otherwise cares are along the lines of obsession. I chalk it up to neccessity, and if your not fed, then you fight, to the death even, like one struggling for air. But merchandising goes that way; nor is anything but an explicit waste of money much more than a subjective expereince. Objectively even for some, but still yours to feel meh over. Its just not worth listening to those who are obsessed, or simply concerned, but act with the force of bravado and control, as if they wished to merely inform. These things aren't neccessary is my point; nor is their place but a dervied strand on a deeper whole. That reflects the basis for it not being so important, and the structure according to that which makes the 'ameloriation' of the situation less explicit. If someone committs a crime, the seriousness of that has corresponding elements of the world to attend. While a bad coffee has not much but an apology; that, and a likely plea to come again next time -with the promsie it will be better. Leisure has a sort of continutity though, in that one may play for days at a park, but then have it close, or be changed; which makes it seem like an injury which you wish wasn't there. 
            I'd say there is this notion of neccessary if not circumstantial evidence, whereby one's expereince is dictated by particular matters local to a scenario. In the case of Star Wars, we are angsty about and frustrrated towards future ones, because we have seen good ones; that, and other ones were not so good, that now were in this limbo, where we know it can be, or wish it to be good, but have  less hope that it will. Our care though is essential, as we remain concerned about the future film; becaue our cares keep us attatched, our state of motion brings negativity, frustration, obssession and ownership. I bring up the basis of our life, where something goes astray and we lack what we need: those feelings of lack which we have for star wars are never encouraged, respected, or successfully done. Nature is something we have to elevate ourselves against, and our assmebly to do so effeciently and or fairly provides the menas for us to leverage our time in order to earn what we particualrly need. While our care for Star Wars is something we can fairly give up. Its cares are from freedom, but not for it. And so I censor our conduct with fair approach, but with unneccessary bounds, merely interests and reserved passion. 
            <br>&emsp;We apply ouroselves differently. Our excesses vary, but can get carried out of hand. It seems snesible, regarding taste, that those who exhibited their interests slimily and with anger, held no interest for those similary drawn, or curious about someone expfressing their care. This is my understanding of leisure. Social norms and conduct get sucked into this, in the slimy expression, and at that hold no real interest. Nor, depsite the 'aim' of things essential, do we earn any contempt. "A rash critique of government is not, if ignored, some sign of one ignoring the imporatnt of government." One ougnht simply not be so pressed up against the princple, that theres nothing but air around (empty volume), nor so seperated from the principle that any substance given is dissproportionate or fitted for such principle. "One can not so blatantly or fluffily speak of democracy withotu extending the contents of what that means, nor, can one be particualry critical, on some specific point or basis, towards democracy." At least, seeing as democracy is a principle, our discoure regarding that is to do with it as a princople; while remarks about 'our democracy', or the world rather, be it democracticr or not, needs remark that actual world.
        </div>
        <div id="thoughtbyme">
            The world is whats assessed, in that it is of a simple manner. At least, the elements which combine into our view of the world, are events, and experiences at that. If memory weren't a thing, or different rather in lower animals, then so would they see the world like we do, in that events for them were similar to ours. Memory though allows for combinations, while lacking memory means that 'your worldview upon this event' is not paired with a view made from prior events.
            <br>&emsp;From this lies judgement and meaning. One being a remark of principles, in that an event was not in line with such principle, and could be judged as good or bad; and of meaning, lies observation and experiment, as to understand how the world operates, and at that what future events will occur. 
            <br>&emsp;One of the loopiest concepts is consistency, or of the constance of nature's function. Besdes what we can presume as contradictory, the question of an event happening due to a process of nature, and at that is likely to occur via that process again, lives on the assumption that such process will A) stay present, and B) stay tuned, as to create that predicted effect. 
            <br>&emsp;Lets be frank about this. If someone in ancient times were to go atop a tower, or a tree, take a fairly large rock and strawberry, then drop them, then the consistent finding that they each hit the ground at the same time would be sufficeint as to expect that this will occur. At least, per that expectation we are inducting, via likelihood. However, as gravity was understood, or the motions of things falling, or via an attraction from some object, that despite the consistent findings, and determinations/descripitions which remarked that, that of the basis of this, or source, so did we not know. As it later became discovered, that gravity, or the effects of attraction (which we call gravitational, rather than electromagnetic) is due to the curvature of space: similar to a mass being placed in a fabric, and causing a groove in the material by which something placed in it wouuld run by. Now, further observations and experiment are measured against this theory, and as they rightly correlate, so does the theory find some validity. That, and the seperate observations which are used to correlate, then have their own explanation. 
            <br>&emsp;What this means then, is that, the falling of two objects of different weight for instance, falling at the same speed, may in fact be inconsistent on the unsure constancy of such source. But, that such basis would produce such ends, or influences rather, so long as it is there, seems fair to assume. And, if the basis' nature changed, and produced different influences, then so would our observations comply. And by virtue of Astronomy, who holds a crucial lens into all of our insights, that contempary observations of the sort are so vast, that we in fact have a reputable source, or ledger rather, which can attest to the influeces being expressed. As it were, such influences have not changed, and the many observations of stellar phenomena appear to be subject to the effects we came to know. In that sense, we can simply say, 'is the world the same', and if so, then we can bank on both the findings and future discoveries born of such basis.
            <br>&emsp;In this sense, we are still operating on the consensus that events occur via baser influences; and that our description of such influences, upon repeated insight, gets attribubted as laws, or principles rather. In many ways there is not much but a warring sentiment of past insights mixed with those more recent; and whether or not the advances of knowledge ought be valued more than prior levels of insight. You'd think overall that such an advance would rightly build and build. But theres this defense against newer discoveries which suggest things different than what was once supposed. And this, is due from revelation.
            <br>&emsp;For starters, revelation, or the defense of it, comes mostly from the fact that it confirms what someone inherintly knows. "Dad, is God real? Well yes son, but I suspect you want proof: there is none. Well how do we know he's real then, if theres no reason. Well on one hand, there is a reason, in that there must be. We are aren't we, blessed; that, and does the world itself not appear ordered? Could such refinement occur via randomness and chaos, or something of a governing sort. And besides all that, considering the truth which we know in our hearts, or are best to believe, so is our assurance of this born through faith, in that we trust that what is to be shown, or given rather, and at that conveyed, is via Gods hand, and will at that."
            <br>&emsp;I'd say that an antrhopoligcla argument could be made as to why this position came about. I think its roots lie in the earliest ape looking up at the stars, and seeing them as events/objects which were not so alike his otherwise wild expereince; which could be described through motions of fear and desire, fashioned by pleasure and pain. But the stars, or a comet, a catalclyysmic event even, beyond the complexion of the impression (in the alarming nature of the latter), that so do these things seem somewhat beyond, and at that seperate from the elements of their ordinary expereince. This surely occured amidst our construction of words, and thus any defined mention of God or principle. "It was simply the awe that one today even finds, as they sit infront of a fire, or see the sun set and rise. A prominent yet weightless expereince, as you are somewhat taken outside yourself, and set to pleasantly be." Such an experinece seems the root of our millenial advancment into defined language and culture. And at that, circusmtnatial evidence permitting, that from that point where orators and or the ordinary dialect of men, could observe, consider and pronounce the meanings behind such 'outwardly' impressions, that so was there no lack of conceptions from the millenia prior, if only dissolute and primitive. God, I reckon, or at least the details which bore substance beyond that of primitive man, seems comparable to our modern conceptions, in that of those views prior, so do our current ones reveal their weakness. And, as the Jews, or even earlier devout bands of man, held their own conceived world view, that so were those an age prior but a less configued sort: or defined one at that. There are cave paintings of Bison from 50,000 years ago; and its hard to imagine that the clerical theism which antiquity is home to, did not have some fainter analog in those ancient times. Or, better said, the question is one of devout prescence, or outwardly concpetion. For if there were, then it seems fair to suspect that such viewpoints were fit for the times: animalistic for instance. While the understanding of the Jews, and classical thinkers at that, seems like medieval men do now cmmpared to Einstein or Emerson. The place of such principle seems unclear; though my ignorance probally defects me by not knowing a likely obvious example (like the bison painting) of religious and or 'outward' princples (in action). Nevertheless, so much, and how far back, such princple is shown, it seems but a propositional weaving is required to stitch together the developments of such principle: from ancient, to classic, medieval and the present. That, and as reflects that principle and its proclivity to make those subject to it somewhat 'foolish', if not overtly sensitive, that so lies our current point of conquest, as to solidify the merrits of that principle, in how each point of development brought new merrits, and at that ironed out or threw away prior findings. Doth tradition lay.
        </div>
        <div id="viewfromme">
            What appears true to me, in some sense, is based on the truth which is. I may be mistaken, and surely culpable of contrasting thoughts. But nature's ways seem quite simply, and single at that. And from this, I see that our view of things, if born of what is most sensibel, or corresponding rather to that, is fairest. 
            <br>&emsp;And my point is not to fashion any sort detail beyond this truth, but to speak what the basis for such truth is. It will be but an adventure past that.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, like Hume, I don't think we can conceive of objects outside the elements present within our expereince. If we saw in infared, then so would our visual regards work from such. And all things conceptual equally fair, in that if we wish to assess, judge or suppose, so are the words and ideas born of what we have perceived and, via our strucuture, conceived internally: and new things thus become fitted via such instruments, or pieces rather. 
            <br>&emsp;At that, I am quite fitted to rest all of our understanding on the routines of observation, and to attest to others (perhaps differnelty views) stances as a mere happening of that. On the basis of Hume, not only are our ideas, or sources at least, based on who we are and how we discern all things -from starting and or initial concepts to those we build upon- but so then (in summary at least) do our conclusions lay. At that, our nature seems such as to consent to the definitions it finds, which it does so by the conduct of its means of sense, and the fashioning of which we only have organs and or surrounding concpets (born of an equal process). Because of this, there seems not but who we are and the world we see. Which, indeed seems to liken to the notion of revelation, where nature shows us herself; and of such inputs, we discern and amend. But from this, it seems the fair line of discretion lies in the truth of the concepts, or definitions rather. Rather than remark upon the particular assembly by which we particualry percieve things, I'd simply conclude on the fact that the result of such perceptions is the goal, and at that merely sourced from precepts. And at that, our discourse and or iqnuiry seems best aimed at ameliroirating the proper conduct in assessing such impressions, analyzing them by the best means, then judging them with blend of austerity and propeity as regards derived principles. For this last part holds the dearest trick, as the nature of our procees being one of impressions and concepts, leave us with somewhat of a constant advance. 
        </div>
        <div id="thepastinwe">
            So much explanation. Maybe its not so much that the method for discovery is divisive, but the actual results from it. It may simply be that those who expereince revelation believe that the observation is sound enough to warrant to the fitting conclusion.
            <br>&emsp;At that, the fidelity, or parameters rather, by which we accept observations and their findings is what varies. As miracles are defintively unreplicabe, nor indicitative of natural laws. Nor are they but suggestions of how the world is, and not the source for our beneovlement conceptions. Those come from neccessity, which itslef comes from the admittence of the world being facilated by principle: which itself is drawn from the observation that nature is somewhat orderly. Although I am not sure if this suggests that such order is consistent; that is, if it can be suspended, or is an otherwise symphotic stream of motion born and governed thrugh such princple, but with cooperation of every bit and strand. At least a harmony and soul to the garment.
            <br>&emsp;I sit here then, quite ill fit to deny the observations of the past, if onyl to meagerly say that their approach to discovery holds no compariosn compared to the rigorous insights in modernity. And should it be? Gallielo discovered the moons of Jupiter, and Einstein the curvature of space. Hubble illuminated the multi galctic nature of the universe. And, oddly, there were deniers of that in a similar manner to those who deny all but revelation and such. This is a fairly common occurence then, of accepting observations and their findings. 
            <br>&emsp;Part of the trouble is in the trepdation of this observant nature. For we cannot quite discern anything true. That is, unless we presume some principle, however fair. But indeed, the grand struggle of man, is in the actionable nature of God, as tradition presumes. For modernity does not conieve of the world this way. And, for me at least, the source of the former sentiments comes from the relativley limited amount of knowledge, and the impossible suppositions which would otherwise keep the consquent princples as being absolute. At least, if they were, so would the extent of our presumption (regarding them) only serve as a minor basis for what we otherwise know. For now, we more or less must presume some principle that serves as the basis for our knowledge so far. The knoweldge the ancietns held though was tne thousand times smaller, and at that, meager in scope: as the edge of a billion galaxies now, was what our local sky seemed. I must admitt, that there are two elements of such tradition, namely the sentiment of the divine, which can assumingly be found in the oldest of men, and secondly, of the more classical sentiment of reason, or morality rather, by which the fairies and mountain gods are put away as superstitous, and while theism reigns instead; where the proposed sentiments are one of will and salvation. At least, theres a neccessary flow to life, by which we wholly amend. Or, in short, the classical way of looking at the world is in neccessity, as reflects the purpose of princple and its offering of a truly blessed life. That is why further  observation is halted, as the propiety for that righteous way is protected. Such interpreations hold little stature, but there objective more so. And indeed I find much merrit in the classics, as they understood the true meaning of our lives. But the actual complexion of us, the world and the propiety to blend it, is not so well founded, and goes only to show that despite the proper resolve to be principled, that the true course of action is one which best learns how to actually be so. Perahps such older ways were stricken to the very notion and act of being principled, that any rigor in discerning the details of how was forgone: or at least seen as a source of confusion and or distraction from being principled at all. At that though, lies the true conflict in man: not between his cave dwelling beliefs and that of Einstein, but of the classical moralists and the modern skeptics. 
        </div>
        <div id="marksonme">
            I cannot say what true knoweldge is. Indeed this has been written about since the dawn of recent time.
            <br>&emsp;But, like a burnt hand is so, and pain at that, regardless of your reasoning about it, so do I have expereicnes and their impressions left in me. 
            <br>&emsp;This is where the trouble with reasoning comes in. For I do believe that most of it aims at proving things we already believe in as true.
            <br>&emsp;What I see, is that events leave a mark on us, and build anticipation at that. Even those elements which seem a given, in terms of gravity, the sun, respiration etc. Death and illness also compare, but these seem like givens which you will only surely meet, rather than something inherent to your days. That, and as this course of life, be it daily or eventual, is the common if not known case, then so are the right actions one which accomodate themselves to that, as to fully address the way things are. Virtue is a sort of lush process amongst this, as she too brings one in line with the finer currents; in the sense that prudence would say in any given scenario, that by its likley course, that being punctual, dignified and prudent were to your profit.
            <br>&emsp;However, not everything that appears to us has an analog which we can weight it against. For one virtue indeed is a self fashioning towards even the finest strands of your life; but in an active sense, so may a new piece of information, or suggestion rather, have nothing to mingle with, in terms of what you already knew. Yet, you may know other things, and at that, have an idea what this absent slot would likely hold, on the basis of slots, and other 'heuristic' regards. This is where principle comes in, or our presumptions/shortcuts which make up for lost knowledge. For I may hear that a war is occuring in another country, but so is that not the world, even if I don't know what the world is. I at least have some sense of space and time, and can extend this outward, if only through reason/compulsion, to fill in the gap. For people may indeed be swindled or convinced by impressions which they have nothing else to compare. But even though I don't know if Aliens exist, I still have so much relevant knowledge that can be slotted in, fairly or not, to deny the plausibility of there being so.
            <br>&emsp;So the idea of Morality is an anthropological one, and has its source in directing one's passions towards reason. The story of this though becomes a thing in itself, and muddies the philosophy which acts as though the nature of things must correspond with the story. 
            <br>&emsp;Then Hume and Kant come along, and say that both our impressions and reasoning are dictated and or limited by our own cognitive processes and assumptions. Per the datum we percieve, and the correspondence with some supposed other, so can such datum only be viewed and or discerned by our personal faculties. While our actual thinking about this has its own moulds for thought, and at that principles which we act on, 'as if molding the subject of thought through a canvas already in place'. That is humes notion of association, and Kant's critique on reason.
            <br>&emsp;Where this leaves us is beyond the principle need of some moral scale in order for good actions to be done and bads ones to be decreed. Life is far more natural, and at the very least, removing the errors of the past, or primitivness of it, so does the modern approach see man as part of nature, with a process amidst such assembly; and pyschology and behaviorial science more credibly discerns how such process is in terms of knowledge and beliefs. 
            <br>&emsp;It all comes down to the impression one gets from a tale of yonder, where the folks behave weirdly, or some incident of heroism or tragedy. For one, these are not so obviously assessed, beyond the actual impact of their concpetion. Primarily though, their concpetion leads to a sort of 'world filling', where hearing one thing leads to a conclusion regarding the broader world: as if such a moment reflects what could be expected in others. Khanemon and Taversky have demonstrated many ways in which we jump to such conclusions. And indeed, ideas of morality and are built on top of this, at least by the roots of ancient impressions which get passed on as beliefs. The idea at hand is not neccesarily wrong, but the process of finding truth ought not be in confirming what we already believe. At least, be it in reaosn, the subject ought be somewhat defined without bias', and otherwise corresponding to other evidence we have. "Espeically as regards nature as a whole, in that all things more or less coalesque." 
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, despite our capctiy for being fooled, so are we capable of rightly knowing. For, if I hear a tale, it would remark something of me to confirm the details befor concluding what happened; at  least, before I act as if it is true. More importantly though, if I hear there was a dragon spotting, besides confirming this, ought I refer to my knowledge of the world in order to incorporate what this new piece of evidence means: rather than letting this peice of evidene be an indicator of how the world is. At that, ask yourself, what is this new event offering me in terms of insight? What exactly is it suggesting in terms of how the world is? For I may know a few facts about the world, and at that feel somewhat reserved in how this new incident becomes incorporated into that broader view. In other words, if a government scandal occurs, it would seem to suggest that the government is evil; and considering the place of government in the country, and the world at that, in other countries with their own governments, so may you concluded that the world  is evil. Or has such evil. But then you remember, or are considerate of the fact, that the government is composed of millions of people, many divisions and organizations; and at that, has various zones and hiearchies. All I would think then, is considering this scandal, who is in fact invovled with that, what does that say about those who weren't, and to the degree that they are, how does the government appear by that. For the initial conclusion was that the government was evil, as the scandal painted the entirety of the government as so. While seeing that only a portion of the people invovled were part of the scandal, and at that a large portion of the government is not either culpable or assocaited with such actions, within our address at least, then all we are left to say is that the government is not perfect, as obviously there is some evil as to produce such a scandal: but nothing else is known from that. And without some other information to sway me, I am at the very  least left with the notion that, to the extent which the scandal does not reflect the government, so is it not evil to that extent. And the fact that our conclusions can be so varied, makes me believe that there is both A) an importance to the contents which the conclision is based on; or in other words since this has to do with knowledge, that knowledge is thus important, and B) that becuase our use of such contents can vary, that the means by which we do so bears a point of fidelity: which itself is made worthwhile by the importance of knowledge. At least, it is necessary for knowledge to be important if we are to discern the acceptence and or judgement of it.
            <br>&emsp;I am not sure what there is to be afraid of besides what we know is worth acting as so. Is there any real reservation besides the statements of others, or the expereince of yourself? To do with God, morals, war, success, shame, is any of it sourced from that which is besides your part in the world? And to remark Hume, could you think, in terms of a subject, and with any words or ideas, which were not birthed from such a place? That, and would an abscence understanding the givens of that world, or at least the prescence of lingering expereinces which filled in such gaps, not produce impressions and conclusions of an according basis? 
            <br>&emsp;And at that, ought we know, what it means to know, and how well we understand what this process is, and its relevance? For at some point, we must say what we know, say what we don't, and suitable address the difference. "Perhaps modernity is in flow, when the steps of it are not held back by the brevity of ancient tradition: which are themselves determinations built on primitive grounds." 
        </div>
        <div id="theprocessoftime">
            Describing the vectors and significance of knowledge fairs the initial taks. For we can speak of qualitys, or presumptions rather regarding aims, but so long as the properties of nature are unclear, so will our values and calm be unsteady.
            <br>&emsp;The issue is largely due to the lineage of men's expereince, and how truths which were once thought so sure, become less so; yet people don't have as much allegance to the means by which truth is come by, but their belief in it. In a contemporay sense, why would anyone ever disagree about anything scientfici, if that which was proposed only held merrit by the demonstrations available; nor, would there be any worth in addressing anything besides that. A truly intelligent man would not shut down any ones suggestion, but remark upon the basis for it. That is all there is. But contempoarly, we still don't behave as though this is true, and let our biases and prejudice get in the way. That, and the old world having such little speculative means, meant that there was so much variety in what people belielved happened. "If none could verify, then the personal impression one got was all there was; but so mucbh as we are talking about things complex, is this method unreliable, and at that varied in the ways that innaccuracy occurs." 
            <br>&emsp;There is something to be said about the dynamics knowledge has in our lives, and why we get defensive when other's suggest things we think false. But there lies the concern, as to the place of knowledge, and whether or not there is any other subject which warrants concern. Because if there is not, and our relevant part of nature is composed of impulse, thought and action, then so can we settle on the fact that the core of our philosophy and world understanding is such. For the present has more reliable means to learning of the world, and at that results which are both robust and testable. In some sense, the contrast of the past and modernity, is that the former saw all proponents offer an absolute claim; while the latter offered rigorous insight the actual portions of nature, and at that, one's discovered from those baser findings. This is how physics, chemistry, biology, geography and anthropology, electronics and industry occrued. And an important tool in our inquriy is in distinguihshing between generally accepted ideas, and that of neccessity. For what things must be is hard to say, and of the reasoning for which others base their neccessity on, I am failry ignorant of. I can say though, that broadly speaking, that entirety remarks the whole. Nature, in all fairness, is equal to that, but in some schools of thought, it is a seperate domain than that which it is housed on: namle the eternal world. At any rate, the motions of nature, be it entire or governed, are definite in kind, regarding pieces that is; while arrangments, despite being a mark of the fashioning of such basis, are themselves ostensible figures of the principal forms. In the way that gases are but zooming particles, or ice a chilled assembly. That, or how a planet is but a clumped ball of dirt -as described by entropy. That, and for all complex structures, these are merely the compositions of distributed material, itself born of field flucuations and dark matter wells. I will submitt the promiscuity of the mind, and how it is somehow a far derived substance, yet somehow in line with that eternal basis; but so will I say, that of nature at least, or existence, that such mind is but a complex of nerves, electric currents and tissue; in the same way that the ocean is really just H20, and its motions are but a remark of the assembly of moleucles and their basis within mechanics -where motions are produced. 
            <br>&emsp;On one hand then, you have the critique of knowledge; not so much to do with its content, but the ledger of it, in terms of the form in which its proposals are made, and the strenght of their basis. That, and the histroy which contains this, and how this contrasts with periods later on. Besides this, sits the critique of definitions, and how a vast array of subjects are marshalled as pure substances, when in fact the factor being addressed is a complex of elements and motion itself. This is indeed a physical representation of the world: and the scale of ostensibility is what we use to diminish the confusion of things thought mistakenly whole. 
            <br>&emsp;Without speaking of these two topics, we cannot be affirmiative; for we will be both to apolagetic our declarations, and exhausted by our footnotes regarding baseless affirmations. Better yet, we suggest, and take things for granted; but we merely have stronger grounds to do so; and at that, such grounds humble our assumptions, in both scale and finality. For we must think, and at that ask from principled grounds. But so does such progress, when the principles are rooted in accuracy, have the means to iron out such principles. This is the inquisitive approach at least.
        </div>
        <div id="normsnearme">
            So the church is more specific a term than you'd imagine, for it represents the administration of christianity; at least, a portion of. It may be proper to use the term churches, in a general sense, but merely as an idea. In that, the world is home to many temples and synaogues. And all of these serve one primary purpose, namely the point of gathering in order to offer thanks and worship. 
            <br>&emsp;This is fine, as are most things. But, when these communions begin to color other parts of the world, and unduly, then there is an issue. For my choice to do something is mine alone, so long as it does not obstruct another. For my own sake, or the pernicous service to another, so may someone intrude upon me. This is fair in a literal sense, as laws exhibit themselves this way via enforcement. But while real laws are instated for the sake of civility and all its aims, the pressures of a religious person to live and be a certain way, under threat even, is not itself backed by law, but belief and personal feeling. 
            <br>&emsp;This is where the difficulty comes in. For those who freely live as they please, may in fact endow themselves into efforts which alter how civil action occurs. The freedom to worship is akin to one's taste in music, or to attend a public lecture, and at that being enriched as you will. But imagine if someone did not attend that lectur, and you attacked them because of it. If you felt that the lecture was beyond important, but essential, and that by not showing up you were harming everyone else, then so like an ordinary law, where the rules protect those from wrong action, and are enforced accordingly, so would one's feeling of a lecture being neccessary, and at that unlawful if not attended, yeild them a comaprable sense of enforcement.
            <br>&emsp;Now, not everyone understands their deity or religion in such abbrasive ways. But doth history lay. And in some weird sense, our inquiry, as it were, feels a sort of resistance, and at that shivering, as if some mysterious force were preventing our thoughts from becoming warm. This is so, for our ideas are not in fact reflective of both tradition and its offspring. The old notion of morality, in that, by speculation, it ought to be sourced from some principal good in the world, by whic we are moral upon compliance, and sin, upon not; so is this a antiquated view of things, based on many older assumpetions. That, and this method of thinking brings with it a sort criticism and or sophistry, whereby the elements of the tradition are made more scholastic. That, or people's concpetion of the world wraps around this: as if to find a better view of morality, or God, or physics: but such views tend to take the same assumptions. And those great men in Hume and Kant merely demonstrated that their are assumptions, and at that poor principles. And of their otherwise claims I care not to say, but only to remark upon the appropraite course for making such claims: which I would only say comes from reliable means of acquiring knoweldge, and our judgement from that.
            <br>&emsp;For the problem with the ancients is that their conclusions were based on false concepts. If it was so, that the fire god spoke, and said bow to me or be destroyed, then one's oblige to this seems sound; and those who did not were fairly convicted as threats, for the fire god would punish all. But what if there were no fire god, as one might imagine or dream, but rather an electric field, born of some origin and according current, and distributed its strands in all directions, twisting and knotting by its moving fashions, whereby the contents of the earth, life, primates and man came to be. And we know this now because we ask better questions, and give ourselves time to find better anwsers. But so is our past riddled with superstition and block headedness, born perhaps of fear and social apprehension. But whether in private, hiding from the mod, or the impassioned within the latter, so doth the roots of modernity lay.
            <br>&emsp;I, as a man, mean only to ask and think. The anwsers to lifes biggest questions feel either poorly described, by which I mean to better understand, or are simply unanwsered, and at that I wonder. But so in this latter lies a mountain of old thinking; thoughts which hold their soul as contrasts to the prior mountain of religious and scholastic sentiment. It least for me, little of what contemporary folks have done originally, or at least thoughtfully from these modern grounds, has come across me. In fact, in everyday life, and in most other areas, there lies little which I would describe as rich or 'great', when it comes to these deeper subjects. That, or they are unstitched together, or full of pedantry and stailness. 
            <br>&emsp;I don't feel opposed, as our civil lives have evened themselves out. But so doth academia lay, and most of it is interested in refininf individual parts: but there no tapestry lays. This is just for my own interest, as to furnish our aims. But the confusion of death, the ostensible view of the senses, the ignorance of worldy proportions, these all shine (dimmly or not) there normative lights, and at that, spark me, in our inquiry, to attend to such assumptions. For I don't mean to make things up: as our inquriy is not some private puruist tailored towards making our own language. I merely suckle at the tit of discovery, and the uncovery of the world's elements. But illustrating this, judging it, and at least wondering how it all works and breathes, is mere curisoity. And an intrigue of which remarks our dark sense of trepidation, as if the norms we otherwise wish to care, hold a smaller basis when the baser aspects of life orient us elsewhere. That is, we tend to think of life, and live by such inquiry; rather than doing what is traditionally done. But so in this deliberation, are matters of life itself, death, mind and such. For doing what was not done in the past, carries with it a sort of empty slot, when it comes to such subjects as they are taken for granted in the past. Death has a guise, as does the mind, and all the topics in the world. And in our inquiry these subjects gently lay. But so in our need to be more forth, and sure, do we see that our thoughtfull ends are not based on such brittle views of such topics. That is, we see everything in a vast sense, via our mode of inquiry; but while no problem occurs, so are we taking for granted such contents, as if the world is to big for me to care. But even though our thinking removes the bundledness of our mind, where some tragedy a 1000 miles away strikes us, so is our tender and broad view but unattended to such incidents, due to our mind's extent. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps this disocurse lacks what all our efforts do, an aim. But, I can say, or what I notice at least, is that we have a fair sense of our ignorance, and what cogs are loose enough for our autonamous conduct to feel somewhat wobbly amidst the norms around. That is the real motive. Not so much that we wish to show others the truth otherwise, 'in terms of how these topics are in a reaosnable sense'. But I just wish to live, to be, and such regards stands on a tender view of these topics. And to ignore them, feels like were fooling ourselves; or moving through the world at least in our striclty private way. Knowing the truth though, makes me on par with the crowd, and at that, above their own false commiseries: for I see how solid they are, and the minor extent of their unkindness. This is all a symptom of our own course of thoughtfullness; but so does this path not cry for a remission of its conduct; and despite wishing for it not to be so private, or without company while it personally focuses, so do the markers and wishes of such motions stay with me, while were calm even.
        </div>
        <div id="themysteryinme">
            So that is to do with the history of knoweldge, and our conflicting need describe death and what not, and the presumptions and or authoirty of the past melding in.
            <br>&emsp;Now, I'd like to mention the core source of confusion in the world, namely ostentation. As in all things, why falsity is poor ins one thing; but considering that it is, so is ostentation the cause.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, I say, 'how does such and such happen', so will we be less able to cooprate, and ultimatley harmded, but missssessing this and acting without fruits. This occurs when 'such and such' is taken at face value, and not what is in fact happening. These words rest on the presumption of our sense, which is its own can of worms. But consider a gas for a second, and whether it operates as a whole, or is in fact a bundle of smaller pieces acting amidst one another. Their relation is akin to the earth orbiting the sun, in that it is part of a system. But saying that their is a solar system is quite general, as would saying there is a universe.
            <br>&emsp;Ultimatley, the problem comes from an understanding of phyics, and how everything that is labelled, normally, is in fact but a differently complex assembly of real things. "Like a house of cards, which is in no way anything but a bundle of cards."
            <br>&emsp;The human error though, and where the nearness to modernity lay, comes when we consider our view of such deck, and how the house appears as such, despite it really just being cards. This notion is regarded as realism, in that things, ostensibly, are taken to be things in and of themselves. I'd say that is a reaosnable anwser as to why this is not so.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, our senses are part of nature, in the way that gravity causes orbits, so do our nerves respond to heat. There is an ignorance on my part as to how the 'phenomena' of expereince is made; but so can we clarify some of the motions which seem otherwise offical, as mere grooves of this assembly. For one, as a squirell is dextrous, compared to a fish, so is man able to speak, see, smell, hear, run, stand, mate, sleep. And the concept of thinking fairly sits as a operative status of those faculties. Thought is not strictly this, but the act of speaking, remaking upon something, considering death. These are all movements of an otherwise assembly: one which we can declare. And where the problem lies is in the doubts of whether or not such phenomena of expereince is in fact beyond nature, or is part of nature; and as touch is really a result of kinetics, and vision a remark of electric potential; or color even, in that it is but an overlap of receptors which remark color, so doth 'our consciousness' lay.
        </div>
        <div id="object&base">
            So theres two general ways of thinking. One, begins with a principle, or fact, and you reason from there. An example being, that nature is either part of or the equivalent to entirety, and by that, all things observed rest inside. On the other hand, lies such observations, whereby you derive no given principle about the world, out of neccessity perhaps, but simply describe the objects around you. Be it of the matrix, by god, or of nature I do not know, but the motion of earth clearly is that  of an orbit, rather than one who is orbited.
            <br>&emsp;In this latter case, the risk runs that you will not be admitted to think, due to observation being the only credible factor. Strange though, that hypothesis work in the opposite way, where you conjecture and suspect: but the merrit though is that such thinking is validated by observation: in that your suggestion of the way things work, must correspond to things.
            <br>&emsp;On that initial standing, there runs the risk of forgoing accuracy in objects, and letting your reasoning wiggle away. If I were Protagoras, I might say 'of all things, which is more perfect, a square or a circle?' And some may reply the latter (based on its uniformity). It is then said, 'and is the Sun not akin to such perfection, in being so round? And if so, does that not inbue the Sun with some quality of perfection?'.  This form of thinking has two flaws, though one is more obvious. That has to do with the accuracy of the object being subject to reason, the Sun in this case. As besides the parameters in question, the Sun is not in fact a circule; at least by virtue of its rough surface; while a real circle would (more or less) be smooth. And the sun, by these accounts, is to that degree imperfect. But the primary issue, and one which is not so easy to state, is regarding relevance, or soundness rather, in that, even  if the Sun were smooth and circular, would that make it eligble to slot into this reason'd argument. For by its accounts, circles are amonst the perfectess of things, by its uniform proportions at that -whereby it lacks all cracks and edges. But so in this argument does it imlpy, that all things which have any resemblence of such property which is found in the perfect object, must be itslef perfect: at least it must have perfection to a degree. And arguing that is much trickier.  For it would be overly simple and absolute to say that the Sun was perfect due to it be circular. But as circular as it was, how much should that imbue it with the quality of perfection? If a circule, being the host for what non perfect things are compared to, is an ideal form, and at that mark of perfection, then how much does some complex object which appears similar to such form, be assessed if such property it holds amounts to the whole of such object. Because at that, we could say that a sphere is even more perfect than a circle, due to its a volumous uniformity. "And who even knows, in that respect, what the sun looks like." 
            <br>&emsp;The point then, is that being reasonable requires an appropriate deployment of parameters, as objects will surley be run through them and accordingly judged, or fitted rather; but therein, do those objects need to be themselves assessed; for on a basis level, per one property  lets say, the prescence of such property (which is our scale) within an object needs more evidence then a surface level appearence: for accuracy may require deeper investigations. Moreover, as the parameters increase, in either quality or quantity, so do the applicants need an according depth of assessment. 
            <br>&emsp;In many ways denying that one's reasoning is sound is a pure trouble, for you need your own  reasoning to argue that their basis is off. But we can demonstrate what mature reasoning is like, in that Socrates, being reasonable, might ask what is the most perfect of things, and at that find his listeners believe it to be a circle; but at this point, he may then ask, 'and is there any holes in this logic, or assessment? Is the circle really an analog for perfection? And, at that, how ought it really be deployed in terms of a scale, as to judge other objects? Moreso, if we evaluate objects on such basis, are we doing them a diservice, at least when it comes to other properties they have which can be assessed? Ought we add more properties to our judgement'. Each one of these questions, by his method, would begin with a question, end with a listenere giving an anwser, followed by more questions. And while observations are set as the point which our reasoning is validated from, so is it the other way around when starting with reason; in that one thinks of parameters, principlpes and rules, that may fit the evidence at hand, while the other estbalishes such a basis, and either looks, or at any rate broadly evaluates, surrounding things on such basis. "By these principles, how do things comply? What are they based on such judgement." And although the basis for truth is hard to say, and at that reason is to hard to criticize based on its deeper nature; but so can we say, that if objects fit themselves to reasons furnishings, then so ought such furnishments be themselves aligned. And, by my accounts, there is no better way of doing so, than asking whether the ones we are using, or use presumably, are in fact so.
        </div>
        <div id="ourplaceinman">
            So Socrates, like all thinking men, did not partake in formulating the truth which was known -as to offer insight or widsom regarding it. Instead, he sought to understand what the truth was: and by that, he gained his reputation of asking many questions.
            <br>&emsp;Now, such an approach can draw scrutinous eyes; for if I say, 'justice is in fact this way', then immediately, your amends to the current of justice are thrown out. What new one's are to replace it is not the point, but rather that you are said to be wrong: for your respects are for something false. This is the basis for imposition.
            <br>&emsp;Still, beliefs come about when one becomes acustomed to seeing the world a certain way, and the required actions. If someone questions the former, so do the implications of what such critique denies, ruffle those whose beliefs are based on it. In other words, if one questions the nature of God, then it is all to easy to find that the inquirer is denying parts of his nature which seem just, and at that neccessary and or promising to attend. This is the basis for contempt, and the labelling of those uncompliant as impious, sinfull, frauds.
            <br>&emsp;The question then becomes one of motive. As our modern age does not shine such scrutiny: for the most part at least. But like Socrates, there is this urge to offer one's insight, in order that the apparent ignorance around is cured. Why this is so I do not know; for even if we could show how a free age without wisdom procurred progressive wounds, then we would still be left wondering why that is our concern. 
            <br>&emsp;I think it is better to state that our interest in being both open and helpful, is a mark of our lower impulses and higher reasoning. For we may not be so genuine in  the former, nor free from alterior motives in the latter; but so do we in our basest of regards wish well for others, and at that our means to support that. But I must confess that the form in which this 'altruism' takes is one of indolence and destiny, whereby the aid we might offer is more dreamt of than planned; nor do we lack self assurance as to our place in being so contributive; by my simplest accounts though, this has the wishes for more action and esteem swirling at the base.
            <br>&emsp;One of the problems perhaps, is that our freedoms are almost limitliess, if not but for the principle of the world. By that, we see ourselves as a citizen of the latter, but thereby kept to aims and cares regarding it. That being so, we remain someone reserved, considering the terrain were working on. And, deeper than our actual view of the world, sits an accordingly needed depth and regard for the principles which direct our motions. For it is all to easy to be overwhelmend by some foreign travesty, only to forget that the nature of good and bad does not rest on such common grounds. The roots of the world are our concern; and as those incidents or remarks of perril are but guisers coming from the depths below, so is our regard as a man centered on the core, and at that the account and mechanics of magma.

            At the end of the day, life goes on. A contemporary mark, is that thinking, and things like it, are not seperate from nature, but akin to unequicable source of vision, so does our mind lay; and accordingly, our thoughts are akin to holding ones breathe, in excess at least. For nothing about the world changes other then the configuration that your thoughts are spurred to produce. The strucutre of this is not clear, but we can say there is one.
            <br>&emsp;At that, life goes on via natures current. And the point is that nothing is excluded from that, including our mind.
            <br>&emsp;What were left then is a natural course, neccessarily. But in that, lies the mysteries of the mind, and how it gets bogged down, obsessed, struck. But, like a memory, so does lifes draw on us give way, forcing our 'thinking' to cede to action. "For none are stubborn indefintiely." And from this occurs expereince, which our memory seeps up. And from that, our current strictness, has some knowledge of the likely course ahead. Not only that there is one, but that it will compare to what our past has shown. From this, a problem we currently have -and is compelling our mind- will surely be sovled; but, more importantly, the future we reach will still be one we are alive in, part of, proceeding. And from that, our grandest inquiries and despair, holds nothing but a momentary slowness within the constant state of progress. "Only, our particualr make ups are such, that action is pent up, then brought forth: like one who travels the globe upon their stilled construction of the wheel: to which space is the subsquent frontier."
            <br>&emsp;In this way, I can say that we have our prior actions, all which have led to our current point. In that past, lies the state of things around me (whence I came), and at that, asked for, recieved, pushed back, and at that, molded me for different kinds of action. "Gravity is a bich, surely: but I watch my step, because I know she'll make me fall down." And around this, lies what I can only be described as an exemption from antiquity, and all her productions; simply, perhaps, due to a fruitfullness which (in my youth) I merely recognized as stiff, tinged with rot, self obsessed, and otherwise disposed to what others had done before. My adolescence was ruled by an otherwise course of discrimination, if only because nothing 'common' was based from such; that is, reasons were seldom given, and of those which were, they were more like drifting garments, sown outside the matter at hand: but little of that core definition was stated. 
            <br>&emsp;Where I now stand, is in between a state of reflection regarding our place as one keen and diposed to discrimination (or examination), and a befuddled state which lacks friendship, romance, application or contribubtion; to which, our gaze settles on the entirety of things, if only by idleness. Yet, such a station is an old one, and at that, is grounded through peace and stability; to which, our choices are what have kept us from being practically defined, rather than our affibility or agreement to it. As our younger years saw much hate and cynicism regarding such things, as if they were both wrong and against us. But the local world is one that affords no hole in our freedom, and at that our choice of action. Time is still up though, at least I suspect so ultimately. And from that, our peace within discrimination, whereby our duties are finely dealt, leaves us in a place of content, and at that, merely aware that choices are what additional things are held by. But, as additions, they are onto one who, to some form and extent, is of the world, part of it, rowing with it. And indeed, I find truth in what I say, in that of our composure and decadence as regards such world, so doth our ignorance collapse from a lack of those additions -as remarks the width of our structure, rather than pure quality. 
        </div>
        <div id="whereilay">
            So, I'd say, with sensible might, that our view of life is such, that as a part of it, we are to some extent wide and peacefull, but at that still subject to, and otherwise prepped for the world. To long has reason and assent been fostered away, as if its aim was to make some new aim, one which was beyond the world. Yet the world is all we need: as it is our relevant strand of nature.
            <br>&emsp;Because of that, I see that the dialectic is really just a matter of progress, and our inability to remain at the current point, all the while reaching an ideal. For life drags us, spurs us, and in many ways, thwarts our sense of how our place amidst life should be. As it were, peace is what we ultimately seek; and personally, if gained, or conjured at least, so may we sit in the nearer parts of lifes current; and at that, foster a broader view of the world, as is both neccessary, and sufficient. For it is not so easy to see the world on the whole, and amend: or define at least. And one's situational peace marks the means to do that.
            <br>&emsp;Our thinking rests on the form of our thoughts, and the basis for such thinking. All things discourse and reason, one being a path to deliberation and our naturally according action, and the principles by which such disucssion rests on. "We are but primal folk otherwise." 
            <br>&emsp;So we lie then, humbly awaiting, gripping the matter of our ideal form. But so doth the approach to modernity lay, for she is still so gripped on the formalities and pedantics of the latter, and dishearted and pagented in the former. "Maybe those on the updraft of liberty, have the natural place of showing what the world looks like and needs, under such an influence. For none in stress see things clearly, or amend without haste. But so are we, of the developed world, and those wholly using it, the painters of such time, the architects, the musketeers. Lifes grip has ceased us; not only in the increasing success, but our perpetuity, and ease by which this comes by. Man hath no fury on his quest for shelter and food. Walmart, Wifi and heating have done so thoroughly. And maybed our honest belief, is that our liberty and strenght, ought carry us in responsibility and resolve, and by that, to our place amongst the world; and thus, to the needs which we individually can address, of which those who fight fires or deal with crime are of contrast. They treat the wounds of the worlds' inefficiency, while those uplifted by fortune and virtue, paint the rafters which draw up such roots, as to make them ironed out and lush. This is the product of modernity so far: but so does the vast ceiling of nature lay
        </div>
        <div id="aliberalpace">
            We could describe choices as those things which you debate; at least, you examine the terms, and decide. While a selection is some action which is done, guided by either impulse, or a prior decision. "As if I had decided that sugar was bad, and at that, fashioned myself to not select it."
            <br>&emsp;Now, considering the priamry relevance of decisions, so ought we base this on the field of choices we'd make. For granted sure, but we may say that there is a nature, that we are within it, and hold a certain part. In that way, all things may in fact be in total, but our words at least can refer to the motions of things. For beyond this integral point, we can say whether or not the universe 'is' or is of existence, or nature, so can we say, that there matter lays, and at that planets, land, continents, and civil regions (from countries to streets). 
            <br>&emsp;In order to remove confusion, we say, that our choices are based on the examination of nature, as to firther know her, and at that, direct our actions as to be agreeable. Besides our origins from her, we can say that our success, as all action is aimed, will come from the appropriate the steps: the mold being set by nature -the parts relevant to us at least. The crucial note though, is that our actions are like gas particles, in that, they act as such in that they are a certain way. And of that, so are we men, and at that animals, who, in need and nature, act accordingly. The point being, that we are bound to be and in that act via the form of nature: of which matter is neccesarily so, as much as it is something, to action. Something may be still, but not even rocks are without flux; their subject to erosion, the motions of the planets and stars, and at that the dispersion of energy. By that, the core strand of nature being all things, or something farther, I do not know: but we are at least within the domain of the former: we are members of the whole, or are pieces of some part of the whole: but within such domain are our actions claimed.
            <br>&emsp;Because of this, we need not marshal what will already happen, but instead be discurvive towards the factors which, in all their guidance, might be wrong. Man need not examine the heat of fire in order to know that it is not to be touched; nor does he need to reason upon his want of food. But if he wishes to achieve the fruits of society and organization, or the use of technology at least, ought he examine such elements, their relevant spots within nature, and how both relate. "That is what has made man so, beyond another animal, an ape. He's questioned, learned, grown, and from that birthed the structures which have born this liberal age. But so in that conduct and the consquent desire, does he often wobble; as the success of one thing makes him equally curious and resourcefull, but not neccessarily with an appropraite mind. That is why Socrates stated that justice and piety ought be examined; for the society in which they were put to use, albeit well formed and intentioned in its own right, had not defined the terms which would permitt it to grow further."
            <br>&emsp;Our philosophy then is one of liberty, in that whether our home is within the whole of nature, or a mere side of it, so do we merely care for, and at that derive knowledge of our being, on that side's basis. In a strict sense, this side of things is one of matter, and at that motion and continuity. From there, all things within such domain will act as their orgins bound them to; but we, via our liberty, need only concern ourselves with the fact that we are ones of such being, and at that ones who's core nature is one of motion. Inquiry can afford us insight into what we don't know, and discourse can discern the detaisl of such motions and their complexities. But seperating the mind and our 'higher' behaviors is not, by these tenants, neccessary or applicable. We need only be as reasonable as our portion of matter has reached. And, in that, we realize one soul rule, in that our rational regards are set upon the elements of the world we define; while our intelligence yeilds us the ripest use of them. "As our motions constantly occur, so do bias' and mistakes lead us astray:  when we go beyond our baser selves. But so, in this innate movment, do we need not usher it towards the truth; but rather, we must merely examine it, and our pace will turn its way."
        </div>
        <div id="wherelifeismade">
            So the world used to be such, that the root of knowledge was in the neccessity approrpaited to the Gods, and that questioning this, or any of the elements presumed, was wrong, and at that punishble.
            <br>&emsp;Now, the world is permivissive to anyone believing what they want. They cannot commit crimes, but our ideas and beliefs do not qualify.
            <br>&emsp;Where we lie then is in the peskiness of examining assumptions, but not proposing a truth. In fact, the route to such knowledge is not known. We learn more and acquire insight, but stitching it together almost always rests on assumption. 
            <br>&emsp;I wonder if this is not what philsophy is; and considering our evidence born from true investigation, that we could take for granted a few simple premises on that basis. It all leads to inquiry though for predictions, and discourse for understanding, all so our principles are truly aligned, and faciliative to our natural action. The anwser is not one that ceases all questioning; rather, we must see how the world is, and at that, foster an effective response. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps the truth lies beyond our final curisoities, and the false distinction between a preferable end and futile one. For my belief, is that if we understand what we were, and at that our life, and that such thing was part of nature and thus her flow, then we could understand that our present being is not part of some temporary state or flux, but rather some figure of nature's many waves. At that, as she ebbs and flows, so do we particulalry go. But lets not pretend that this form of eternity is not sacred if it has not 'misssapropritated view' , or that nihilsm is the proper resolve; for these feelings are born of belieds; at least they are bits and specks of our higher thought. That is, if I said a man was coming to attack you, you'd have some apprhension; but if I said that you'd die in a million years and rest for eternity, would you even blink. I'd say theres much preference in that. And so, your idea that the your life is either of the 'afterlied', and favorably such, or is otherwise poor and at that conducive to nihilsm, may admitteldy be true, or sound at least, but is a discrimante response no les: and ought we be thorough in that? For our examination of the motions around us and ourselves, and the principles derived from this, that lead your otherwise feeling of life to change, can lead to a conclusion which is based on equally defined terms: only in the case of the former, where your past definitions run against the contemporary truth, so can we examine those definitions, and at that, reach the greatest of truths: namely that death is not evil, but a promise of rest and tranquility. And that, from some liberal examination, you can attune your beliefs as relate to the rules which natures conduct is judged by, in such a way that is equally sound as such conduct. And there life is made.

            I grew up in one of the most wonderful places in the world....British Columbia. In that land, we were given liberties like the rest, but amidst a landscape which can only be desacribed as green and gold. Not once, be it winter or some other moment of cold, did there ever lack any moment of cheer. As a boy, we ran through the brush, ducking in and out of creeks, getting into all sorts of trouble. And not but the perrils of everyday life could tell me that life wasn't a treat.
            <br>&emsp;But that time did into come about; at least, those perrils began to usher their strain. You see, life was not merely something to hold onto, or work towards. Rather, it was a defense, as if predators were always in sight: or sensed to be around the corner. And although my younger years did not fall prey to such constant guard, those around me, who I would at heart call dear, began to implode.
            <br>&emsp;You see, my mother and father were all but cruel and wicked. Their hearts poured over me and my sister, ceasing only at time's many frictions. They never hit me, nor did anything I'd consider wrong. But I do recall, with unrested sincerity, that their howls of worry and contempt left me with nothing but a hatred for stupidity. I don't know why, but all things common and accepted, be it for duty  or success, slid right by my reverant sight. I did not, in kindness, care for my grades, nor a job, or girls at that. These things were either forced upon me, and so my amends were from apprhension, or I thought things were dumb and without warrant. "Boys do this some times, or girls even, when they like another, but through their nerves say the other dumb, 'and that such interests are stupid'."
            <br>&emsp;At that, my life truly began. For upon the peak of my youth, were the rungs of life which I was prepped to bare. Only, I had not the stance, interest or mindset, in order to, or with any aim of, finding such success. I never quite failed, as living in middle class in this country forbids me from reaping so: but I did lose some things, namely the ability to make a friend.
            <br>&emsp;For the heart of this story is that, in averting myself from the common path, I had to find another. As it were though, our life had not oriented me, upon such situation, to turn to anything truly perilous, but 'unproductive instead'. I smoked and lounged, argued and whithered away. And from this, our time never became quite so negitive, and at that, not so positive; for we never hit unmitigabye lows, nor were pulled past the novelty of any situational highs. Our soul semester of college is a mark of that. Instead, we simply idled out, stilling ourselves into a place which lacked little, but had not, to which, dearly, we hewed the seems of our basic self.  To which I now lay, a man, garmeted with a decade of royal treatment. Yet, as all Kings, my riches do not give me but a hollow glow: for under that crown, lies one without peace to be on their own, nor any ledger of strong accounts, of choices which earned them a friend. 
            <br>&emsp;There is hope though. For most reason and gallantry sheds light on the literal riches of power and success, and all its false ends. While I, in our own state of lordship, must merely coallesque to the truth at hand: and that is the fact, that of this age of change, whereby I truly became me, that such a route was not deemed for all the foolish ends which thwarted my aims: but instead, to the truly near and dear gains, which I supsected and have claimed. "And for that I've worked towards. Becoming myself though held not itself the gain: and what life has simply tought me, is that being who you truly are is not itself the goal, but the requistie to being."
            <br>&emsp;And with much thanks I say, down such road I am.

            I think that prefacing our philosophy on the basis of knowledge is a strong position, for the elements of it can be rooted in the nature of their speculative form. And at that, we can somewhat state the importance of knowledge, and thus revere the proper form of it. And by that, with a mixture of our personal situation in such writing, and the otherwise liberal state within a largely agreed upon world -as drawm by examination- bears me a structure to extract some princples, and work from. This is where the mention of nature being soul, in that there are not many, and at that interpreations; and, of such case, the part of nature which holds matter may be nature itself, or all of existence; or it may simply be a strand. In other words, nature may hold something beyond matter; and at that, may have differeny regions, or unvicerse rather, of matter. In fact, the universe is the domain of matter, as thee or 'ah' universe. From this, we ought riggle a bit as to say, what it means for us if nature is not entirely within the realm of matter but beyond. But from there, we can remove a great deal of apprehension due to the advents of cognitive science and anatomy, where, in which ever manner or not, the form in which our mind and behavior takes, is of nature. And the key part, is that, if nature has some sort of base which matter rests upon, then sure, our mind is derived from it. But it is equally so as all other parts of matter (or existence); and, via laws of matter and, at that, how matter goes, and the otherwise principle which retains matter within itself, at least in regards to any of its structure, so does our mind equate. It is fair to ask, if exisence rests upon the soils of reality, but is more or less distinct, how such reality means for existence to grow. But as it were, our understanding of matter, is that is merely an arrangment of pieces, distributing themselves via the source of such pieces. From that, rocks may have destinies, in that their part within the current was born from natures push of the dominoes. But it is the modern case, that our cognition (and such elements) are not discrete portions of that baser nature inhabiting the material side of it. At least, as much as existence is brought forth and distributed via the whole of nature, so does such strucutre remark all that is contained; of which our mind is so, positiviely, but with a contradictory principle as regards an exhibition of nature in particulare to us, as our mind is concerned at least. 
        </div>
        <div id="paint&portrait">
            So imagine a canvas, at least something with a nature who 'houses' something upon that. And in this, consider the canvas in kind, but through varied shapes and forms, like a strand, or (ocean) current. Then think of the paint, or that which is put, or at least set, upon the canvas. "Like red dye cast upon a string."
            <br>&emsp;Now, if the canvas is woven, like a strand, into some sort of form, so does this suffice to explain the world as we see: by the partcile and force nature of it at least. But even then, if the strands, however woven, did not create the entirety of phenomena, but were due to the colors of those strands, then so the world lay.
            <br>&emsp;I worry though that this idea is not reflective of reality, as in all fairness, there being only strands and not paint, seems the right portrait. For a few problems rise if it is otherwise. Namely, how the positioning of the paints, as respects the orientation of the strands, creates something which is not, in truth, better explained as the arrangment of strands. "Or in other words, that your not saying anything much, if some property of the strands is what creates what is better put as an effect consequent of the strands." It is worth mentioning the possible nature of the strands, and properties which we may consider may be as a result of the arrangment of strands, or has to do with the strand itself. And I would say there could be many strands, in kind at least, but so is it simpler to describe the supposed results with just strings. 
            <br>&emsp;Secondly, is whether or not the paints on the strings interact in and of themselves. This is where the trouble comes, as not doing so just leaves us with the strings themselves, and the color which we attribute is in fact just an effect of the string's arrangment. For it could be so that the red of one string and blue of another create purple, but where, beyond the strings, floating in the void of them? Or does it change the red and blue of the two strings into purple? 
            <br>&emsp;In other words, as regards wholes and pieces, there is a certain insufficency in explaining something by using pieces which have no place. But when you see that this can be said about everything, and that the simplest anwser is really what the 'colored' ones are derived from, its hard not to lean on that one. For the idea here, is that the world is not some substance upon a current, or strand, but is the strand. And the point is not to conceive literal pieces of rope, or to give any sort of body or defintiion, but merely illustrate the fact that nature is not a house to the world, but is the world itself. For the world as we see has much ambiguity and room for doubt, surely. But beyond our actual understanding and how the finest explanation suffices, you are still left with the issues of placing a weaving of existence upon some other sort of weaved basis, as each amounts to the same. How a soul nature exists, fully contained is hard to say. But suggesting that there are strands and paint is but a pairing of the core problem: which, in all fairness, does not suggest or invite the notion of there being anything but a soul nature.
        </div>
        <div id="relationtoman">
            So our thoughts breathe off of description and knowledge, for we have things to speak of, and the means to speak of them. 
            <br>&emsp;In that though, lies contrasts, or opposites when it comes to 'isms', such as nominalism or realism. Notable in this, is the notion of morality and panatheism, and their compatibility of an ideal form of nature which sits beyond the existence were part of; and as regards the physicality of the latter, so does it get imparted on, fundementally and or momentarily, by the former; and, at that, our idea of life, and at that the mold for amends, extends to such ideal domain. 
            <br>&emsp;Positively this is not so, as akin to Einteins ingenuity of removing the medium by which physics acts, so does it seem fair to presume that nature is entire in its whole, and at that not so seperate when it comes to the realm which we live in. 
            <br>&emsp;"There is much to do about knowledge, definition and inquiry when it comes to seeing and or describing such a unified world: but so humanity lays."
            <br>&emsp;I will admitt that our postive statement is not without balance, as we are indeed deriving some principle from observation, and also ignorning traditional principles that lack observation. That, and we otherwise suppose based on what is known; and indeed very little may be so, but so do the grand conceptions born of non-evidence hold little sentiment despite such grandeur. In that way, I am acting from the base of modernity, or examination rather. I think that the concerns which our principles are aimed at have much to take away from those who developed such sights in absolute ways. But the truth of the matter is, that of the world which they evaluated and concluded from, so were such conceptions ill  founded. "And their shortness gives some explantion as to why 'the absolute' was so ardently sought and reached: as litte examination prior was done." 
            <br>&emsp;In other words, I have the sense as to why nature is how it is based on a fair understanding of how it is described. And although our details are limited in scope, I do maintain a speculative composure, as to be general and unconvicted as regards our principles. As such, furthering our knowledge would afford a firmer base as to solidify such principles, and to our judgements, know. But our buisness in being otherwise is for me to deal with. That, and any scrutiny or suggestion as to some other world conception, which could afford firmer principles, appeals to me little. As I believe nature is one, and at that variable only beyond the truly verified parts, whereupon the ideas of nature show an assorted complexion. "But such sprouts of possibility are atop the roots of modernity, or examination." And as it were, those convictions born of primitive grounds hold no admittence by me, in terms of consideration, and at that selection. "For it is the mark of intelligence to remain postured in the face of uncertainty; and besides the lack of merrit, there is, in those ancient grounds, no value in settling -as if any conclusion would do."
            <br>&emsp;As a result, we are not measuring this modern take of nature against past rules of judgement. Those were very much dualistic in their conceptions, and resolves at that; which is not what the modern view prescribes. It is true that the form taken to be true in the past shares some resemblence with the modern form, namely in terms of the multiverse. But so does this, however comparable to that multitude form of nature, not neccessiate some cosmic deed towards the deeper part of that distcintion. In part at least, on the basis considering the need for some servicable submission to nature, and to some select part at that.
            <br>&emsp;Philosophy, in its truest form, is in relation to man, and his use of it as guidance along his active path. This may be something different than philosophy; but if so, then philosophy is not a prime concern. What is of worth is hard to say; for some begin with examination, while others act on innate principle. I would argue that the latter is born, to some minimal extent at least, by the former. And at any rate, the elements which the latter uses hold no substance if they are not themselves examined. I will not say that such objects of principle need be sourced from the world; but so much as they are, 'and gosh what farce has man in this case seen' that statements invovling such content need be appropriated. One could question the neccesity for an object of the world -within the use of a souly principle realm- to be defined by what it is in terms of the world realm: but I cannot submitt any thoughts as to how it would have definintion at all.
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, an idea which said that God, as principally known, and served, via actions as defined by principle and to an end of the sort, is perhaps the true lane of devotion to divine. If nature is one, or at least functions with us as  part of it and not something seperate, 'or seperated, and at that aimed to reach', then the divine is not a true conception. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, I have a real statement: and it is of pure pity. For I cannot say what is true, normally remarking a false or incomplete statement. "And a statement then which is not in fact entirely so, is not something I know: besides it being merely statementish." What I can say though, is that, as I, and all other people, are free to believe something antiquated, so am I at liberty to feel as though there is no divine, and at that, any value in thinking on pure principle; along with refraining from including world objects within such principle, but with no address how they (as world objects) are. As per my privaleg to believe, so am I at liberty to doubt: in this case, to the merrits and or ability of conceiving of something of the world, in a non world matter, but yet with some sort of form or identity not sourced from the world. "I am just not clear or able to see, how at that point anything can be concieved at all. For what is the reference, or idea, if not derived from some being? How is their red to a blind man?"
            <br>&emsp;There is a crucial matter though. For if I believe the universe is whole, and you believe it is seperated into existence and the eternal fold, or if I don't act on any basis of there being the divine, and you do, what does it mean for me to merely accept that you think that way, and to expect the same from you? Is that all there is to it? Permitting someone to have their beliefs? Because what happens when it is a matter or taxes, and we belief that seperate measures should be introduced. Or, if you have some resolve based on the divine, and I do not, what if that leads to abbrasive resentment. "As history has shown." 
            <br>&emsp;This may indeed be the core fact of them all. For why is it alright for some to be christian, but deny their children contemporary aid? Why is it alright for Catholics to live and breathe as they please, and by our accounts is fine, but to then remain accepting following the Rwandan genocide. It is fair to suggest that those involved were not acting as would remark being Catholic. But so the mystery lays. For disagreement is natural, and despite having seperate wishes, each party can usually accept the final finding; on the basis that the result was reached by majority. But what about stubborness, as might be found when one presents information regarding a certain topic, but such information is to related to other bits of info which they deny. I am thinking of geology and Geneysis, and how certain folk believe the earth to be a certain way. Which, again, is fine, and be accordingly. But what happens when one of those folk recieves evidence regarding climate change, and at that a request for action. "What if theres a mix of stubborness and denial, born from the dissmisal of the climate report, because the heart of its merrit compares to the merrit surrounding geological claims. Its not so much about seeming contradictory, but denying one on the care to admitt anything of the kind: the feeling of which comes from a conviction against the results born from geologies methodolgy: an approach which climate science is ingrained to." 
            <br>&emsp;In other words, how much are rights permitted when it comes to beliefs, when such beliefs lead to an infringment of otherwise civillay determined rights. It may be simpler than that, but it does seem, in way or the other, that by denying one the actions born from their belief, that you are saying their belief is wrong. For surely there have not been single members of communities who have acted beligerently on the basis of certain beliefs. And by saying no otherwise, you are in fact saying that you don't think their feelings are justified. As our world is structured in a way that exhibits that, but not always in the past. For the Pope literally told the Knights to go on the crusade and fight for Christ: he literally emplored them to rigtheous violence. And now, if you say to a man, that he cannot kill despite his righteous claim, you are in effect denying, or forbidding, the source of such claim; as you would otherwise permitt it, and by that validate such source. If someone says that God ordered him to kill someone, how could you say no, its God. But you do anyway. And depsite the meaning of this being more than a simple denial of God, so are you, in the manner in which the one denied feels about such (divine) command, that the merrits of it are off: and I can't help but feel that the denial of such merrits, denies (to an according extent) the basis which such merrits are plead from. "For it they were merrited, it would be because you admitted such base. And it seems hard to say, 'No, God is fine, but we just don't want you to listen to him in this case'. But he is all knowing, and holds the title of all mighty: of which we deem his word law. How could you deny it." 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps ultimatley, that those on the side of the divine, or those not, that denying one's wish to kill on some divine basis is perhaps a fairly presumptious statement, that the divine does not wish for so, and by that, the person (who feels their commanded) is confused -or mistaken rather. "It is just hard then to say whose right."
        </div>
        <div id="fullandgoing">
            When we say that nature is soul and entire, we simply mean that the world is continous, and at that evident. We may not have seen all, but we can discern principles and or expecatations based on what we have seen. "And the most important rule of life, is to base your convictions on the strenght of grounds for them; but, more crucially, that what you have seen is what there is, rather than some concession of what there ought be."
            <br>&emsp;In that way, our life is without concern for Mars or Andromeda, but of Man and the earth. In this way the structure of life persists, and we are at but a moment. 
            <br>&emsp;In that way lies the heart of all talks, namely the course for right and wrong, and at that justice. By this, we settle on the motions of governance, as a sort amends to such motions. Knoweldge remarks what such steps are inline with, while civil assemblies are the execution.
            <br>&emsp;In this way, lies the core confusion, namely of what remarks the means to such execution, and all the strands which it official (or effective/actionable), and the ancillarly force of change. For we are lucky to have presidents rather than monarchical kings. As one held all the notion of choice and change, while the former makes decisions equitable, which itself lays the groundwork for additions to stability. The times may not breathe such fortune, but at least it is fair. Change then stacks upon this official process; and not onto an otherwise structural whim. But the change is never to the complex which makes things stable and official, but to additions as to bring more life and substance to such solidity. By that, democracy is in regards to the decisions made, as to collectivley conclude which course and measures should be made. But that there are decisions, and at that ones notified by the executive, legaslative and judicial system, is not up for contention: potentially or of any ones interest. By that, I rest on the world being at worst the same, and dissapointengly not improved. But so do the specifics of this fall under a statistical analysis, as every individual can handle challenges differnelty, and appreciate improvments as such. "And as regards climate, foreign relations and domestic rights, so are these of particular proportions, and thus quite obscure to our judgement: but a lack of seriousness in how these are taken, on the whole of it, is not to be expected." 
            <br>&emsp;In any case, I will state that the world is fine, and at that ripe for or in need of change by some statistical analysis. And from that, it may be said that each particle of gas exhibits itself to every other member by virtue of its immedate relations, and the reactions which spurr from those. In principle this remarks how right actions are done, as you push a little and cause a cascading effect. But we can say, in all fairness, that the more volumous the gas, the less concentrated we have to be in terms of a single partcile, or motion. This remarks a sort of retreat from an overy ideal action, whereby a thin concept of the entire world is taken to wholly, and the according actions which are given way to much emphasis in being immediate. This accounts primarily for the world and countries. "That is, our princple can rest more locally, rather than presuming that we ought to be bold on such fronts. For who could change the world, and not their own town? Yet such a choice feels so less drawing, and at that ingrained via hard facts; all of which paint a very procedural and systemic route."  
            <br>&emsp;With that in mind, we may consider the needs of communities within our proximity, and at that, ignore the pleas and passion of overly thin world pursuits.
            <br>&emsp;I think that anything besides that is akin to a painting, whereby you look at something, see it, take something, and then bring it back to the relevant parts of your life. Such relevance may extend to your town or region. And we ought see things which are commercial, advocate, advertising, shrude, ignorant, charlotan or ideal, for what they are. And as for their contenious place amongst the real world, rest on the statistical principal, and the mitigation of doubting whether such 'expression' hold merrit; or at any rate, if they are so 'condensley' heard. For in a world only conciveved by statistics -by people on mass- so does such principle not suggest those expressions are heard unanimously, through any real collective, or serioulsy even. "As such expressions paint a world beyond the one relevant to peoples lives, and thus peoples cares are proportional to that. They may find interest in what is said, or be concerned with what their shown; but so are they then spurred to contribute from their personal level, reaching as far as they can; that, or they are impassioned, and effected as such as regard their behaviour: which is a matter local and or private to them."
            <br>&emsp;So given the statistical nature of the world, as we can remark at least, and the removal of fear regarding people who act more declartively, what ought we personally do? Better yet, what ought anyone do? Because maybe the truth is that I live in place which has no grieving need for me to contribute. And because of that, I am not inclined to contribute at all, for being in our relvant strand of life, and it being fine, so are happy to be. One may advise us to look beyond ourselves, and at that look for other strands of life which are in need: but we'd then only be helping those within that. Indeed I can do that, and part of our fineness within our functioning part of life, may encourage me to do so, if only to do something more involving and important. 
            <br>&emsp;What I would say, is that of normal things which I personally attend, so does this widen my mind, and at that my near sight. From this, comes interests and oppertunity, however fairly based. And weirdly, I can say that from such sights, following efforts which truly cleared my mind, that I hold onto such scenery, and at that the actions which keep my lens clean. This is where guilt comes in, for we are so bent on our own expereince, that any idea which suggests we ought contribute somewhere else, has me in reserve. Again though, the impetus to contribute is more bent on the natural care to treat what is relevant to you, and the mere positioning of that where any place of relevance is in need. But as one who is occupied sees not but their requirment, so do those free seek further obligation, as to move beyond the emptier pace of freedom. But the ethical, or quality commitment, whereby one is drawn out from their life of self control, to expereince the greens of virtue, so in that does liberty lay. 
            <br>&emsp;In other words, those who are free and merely exempt from duty and deed, and at that open to apply themselves. While those at liberty, are such as to be where they want to be. I guess the emphasis of discourse ought centre on the mold which one of freedom may not have, and how contribution may seem an eligble anwser (for them to do something). While liberty is born from virtue, or self treatment, and the pure interests which it excites. How anyone every reaches this I cannot say; for it seems almost natural that, in life, considering its obligations, that our slightest excess above this would amount to treating with those who were in shortcoming. And at that, how would anyone ever come to the sentiment that their own attnetion was important, in terms of things beyond their basic needs. Why would temperance be concieved, or reflection, determination, or quality? Life perhaps would had to have been very free for such things to be cultiavted. My sense it that literature is what spurrs this, as such ideas are found nowhere else. And, to some extent, literature and devotion go hand in hand, and at that come through the peak times of civilization (relatively) -which we moderns are digesting. 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, I'd say that the war of men through the recent centuries is merely born of divine roots, and the modern reproach from such conceptions. First there were the inquistions, then the european wars, followed by the conflicts between Britain, Spain and France. Then there were the Franco-Prussian battles, leading into an entire European war...twice. And through the advent of that, slithered the apprehensions of the victors, due to their previoulsy gained power. There hands remained hesitant though, and suspended not but through the middle eastern conflicts, and some otherwise niche affairs. For whatever reason, the governments of the world have come togther, operating together on efficable grounds, and to an increasingly generous degree. 
            <br>&emsp;In this way, literature is the bearer of conflict, for it instills within folks conviction, and thus a brace against those otherwise read. This may be driven from prior conduct, but so do such motions find their legacy in writing. And what I'd say, is that as this war has gone on, so have accessory pieces been brought along, to which virtue has been claimed. By Plutarch and Seneca, Montainge and Spinoza, Hume and Kant, Emerson and Nieztche, and all the nearly modern greens;  so have we not been brought down by the broader engagements, but become in fact well read. And indeed, it is wise to know, and at that not give in to what you don't understand, as to the broader routes in which literay disagreement takes; but so does virtue born of literature remark what a man without enemies or chains ought do. 
        </div>
        <div id="civilaction">
            So virtue has to do with action, and those amidst other people. While morals are centered on duty, responsability, service. On one hand, the more equitable a community is, the less duty calls, but virtue. As your actions are more bent towards accepting what offered for the sake of all people. In that, virtue is a love of other people and the governance which supports them. Better said, virtue is an understanding of needs beyond oneself, and ameliorating the wants and needs which equalize that. On the other hand then, morals remark what this society actually needs from you. Virute, as said, is not so much a gift, but an acceptence of the world at hand, and disposing yourself to that. "As if your simply waving a different flag." While morals remark the service required of, per your country. In this sense, I see how an economy remarks such a land, and considering everyone has needs, so ought they be met through such system; as most folk do, and at that benefit from everyone participating; while stealing and or nepotism sidetrack the whole affair. Per the stage of a democracy, prior less democratic functions will see future disparities, and at that privalage. But so ought we use this well. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps the problem is one of action, for just as people achieve resources to meet their needs, so do they reach for actions if their freedom is above this. Our liberty was garnered through literature, and at that cultivated. But acting from it has always been a hard thing to do; and the treatment of virtue has often been our goal, as opposed to any then grounded action. Without action, we seek it. Thus our minds querry as to the proper path through the world. I think that overall, the right system is one where everyone wins. But even if it were a lopsided one, so a system it would be; and partaking in this may not mean more than holding your personal post: meaning that you don't whither yourself away, nor take away others. In that sense, a firefighter is being as sericeable as a state offical, as they are both spending their time in a serviced way. Maybe its wisdom which alights the mark for your generosity. But so is this but a wiggling path away from self destruction and luxury. For you may be guided to a family, and a cash register. You must merely be yourself in the society, but fully. Not based on the asks of such society, but the need of it: which is that you would let the harvest be equally spent, and that you would not thwart the system for your benefit: nor that you would take part in suicide, or despair: for losing you there tugs on us all, and otherwise sulks at even a single missing piece. In democracy it is the more the merrier.
        </div>
        <div id="lawofnations">
            The Law of nations remarks the relation of governments between others, or countries between others. Politic laws remark the structure of local governments, and their relation between the govenors and governed. While civil laws remark the relation between citizens. Murder is a matter of the latter, while the right to a trial is a mark of the former. And as regards the first, victory through conquest for the aim of preservation may be the deed of one nation over another. But so does time allay, and yeild more harmony between nations. As it is best, in war, to do the least injury in order to achieve victory; while in peace, to do the most for one another. On top of this, within the nations realm, lies a somewhat obscure, yet standard, array of departments and or institutions; those being either private by citizens, govermental, as in the department of agriculture, and public, in terms of some civil affair.
        </div>
        <div id="thecollective">
            So man in his basest state follows no law or custom, but his whims. Civil laws then make his society function, and fertile. But natures law draw some other side of him, as if the ebbs of time are being amended. 
            <br>&emsp;Liberty describes someone able to do as they please. And indeed, leisure, pleasure and activity fall in this line. But it is important to note, that this sort of liberty is not a mark of freedom, but natural amends. As one may be set in a civl state of the world, and bound by it. But seeing as such a state is aimed at offering someone their needs, then so upon this being met, can they attest to the laws beyond that, namely the goods of reason. For the beauty of the sky or the peace from reading, are not things which come from the societal aims of food and shelter. Such things do abide by natures laws, but as respects the baser concerns we share. While liberal goals, or interests, are born from an excess of this, whereby we don't merely respond to such nature as to better serve or needs, but to see her, and take her hand. 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, soceiety is aimed towards the happiness of its participants, while liberty is aimed at the joy of ones life. In one, we act through reason, and govern ourselves as to efficeintly meet our needs. "If our extraction of natures stores is equitable and thought out, then we will all flourish." But imainge, if we had no needs, nor any reason to fear. What would we do? In other words, why are colors appealing and grand structures. Why do plays intrigue us, or music; or the wonder of science and history. Why is there fun. For you might think, like a cow, that if our needs were met, then we'd sleep and settle. Yet man has this impetus to culture, as if a complex which marks the sights born of our excess.
            <br>&emsp;In that way, one ought know who they are as respect the society their part of, and at that the measure of needs. While culture is a sort of interest, or care, as if one was secure enough to see freely, and at that be drawn; spurring then our dances and stories, writing and tales. Culture does not reassure us or give us relief, but moves by our purest draw: like one's pleasure upon sugar occuring naturally.  "I just don't know though how much I should care about our dance, when the ability to do so is born of our own freedoms, while others may not have so: at least we are ignorant of how we are even supposed to be, and thus whether we are doing it."
            <br>&emsp;If I am a citizen, then my will is such as to be in line with constitution. How this ought change, I do not know. But I see how our place in life is somewhat consequent of such affairs. In some sense, my will being out of line brings with it punishment. But in the case of violence or theft, if I do not do these things, willfully or not, then so am I in line with the constitution. There are indeed things that such statements require of me;  as I need satiety, and by that, of what I earn to acquire it, some must be submitted for the public good. That, and if the country is under threath, then the public good may require service. And indeed the state of country and its relations will make this a higher demand. I would say however, that a mature democracy is one which has equally democratic neighbours; at least, one who is able to care for all its citizens, likely is not oppressed by others whose actions don't reflect that. At least it seems fair to think that conquest is not required for the needs of your citizens to be met. "Less you aim to destroy, and at that add to your stores." Nature has given all, and governance is merely an arrangment as to deploy our efforts for the gain of all. "These lands, led by a sort, will feed those led by such sort." In many ways, the conflict we see in the world comes from the uneveness of those still 'undeveloped'. For developed countries, with some exception, care not to conquer and command, but to bear sufficiency for their inhabitants. The question, is what are those inhabitants to do. For they cannot murder, rape or steal; nor can they particpate in the path to their satiety, and not tribute something to the public. For the prescent of roads, medicine, power and services is not what the country affords people to instate; rather, it is something provided for them. Some of these may be possible in the private sphere, but roads for instance are a mark of the lands, and at that property, of which a government is a standing body around. "Or a mark rather, for such bounds."
            <br>&emsp;I cannot help but think from our current state. And by that, there is not conscription, nor anything but the request of taxes; along with any restrictions regarding civil interaction. And at any rate, that my pursuits, in the way they are made, must oblige the law generally, and in ways particular to such pursuit. "Such as a buisness license." If the government means to serve all, and is not unequitable in terms of class, then all any citizen can do is accept their standing as one's of equal standing, and by that appreciate what is given, understanding that any lack of privalge is due to the equity given to others. But then what, are we free to make do, to learn, share, create? These are marks of oppertunity, and fruitfull by the value created. "A fair exchange, even if one exchanges with many and thus grows in equity." 
            <br>&emsp;But where does virtue lie truly beyond the collective need? Perhaps our time bears ignorance to such appeal, for there is no apparent war or local famine -despite there being some impoverished. But there are folk lacking, if only from the dynamics which an less mature democracy produced. But so civil service lay, and legislation at that which makes private pursuits more equitable -the minimum wage. But if I am not a servant acting on such behalfs, or a higher official working on legislation, what am I to do as one of those men subject to such affairs. Perhpas we are lucky as to be unburdened, and at most guilty of our fortunes, and not their actual shortcoming. For in such an even state, I notice where I am personally lacking. As if upon finishing my buisness, I notice a wound in my thigh. And indeed this insight bears much life and means for generosity; yet for where I do not know. As singing and or dancing is hard to do, nor poetry with much difference. Seemingly I could, as I wish, contribute. Yet in such direction I do not stand. Our choices are not making such efforts available; at least, theres a future which I wont deny. And I thought of this some time before, that our need to move and the hesitation which I see, is really a remark upon you and your wish to act as would be good. And from that we are not so happy or with joy, as we are unactive. 
            <br>&emsp;The question then, is upon your move to Pitt, and the further move to something of stability, what will you till then do? For games are games, and movies and shows alike; but what is your course, goal, direction? For I feel without one, and our wonder and joy has nothing to live beside. I could learn more, but it all feels like were making it easier to be inactive. "As we feel guilty and ashamed to be so." 
        </div>
        <div id="subjectandthought">
            Two things: the subjects of thought and their validity, and the nature of validation. On the latter, I mean the conceptualization of phenomena to be then used in formal thinking. If I say 'the dog is blue', and then I mean to speak about such dog, I ought know what it is, and the property blue at that. We might say simply, that identifying the elements which we wish to interprate, understand or evaluate is critical, or essential rather. The risk is one thing, but it is another on pure valid grounds, to say that something has a certain meaning, when in fact such thing is not so. "That round object is dangeorus, yet there appears only a square: where is the danger."
            <br>&emsp;In this way, we can say, that observation is the material for thinking. Abstract objects may differ, but so is it akin to Hume to say, that the complexion of such abstraction will be born from real impressions. At any rate, the observations we make are akin to relations, whereby we see one thing here, and then it goes there, and how other objects around it compare. This is the nature of laws, in that things act a certain way amidst other objects. 
            <br>&emsp;The domain of relations is a system. Namely a universe, a galaxy, a solar system, a planet. But so are organisms of the sort, and atoms at that. "Even particles and their surrounding forces may be mere arrangments of baser fields." And what observation does, is track the motions of such elements. We may ask where they come from, in origin and end, and at that what they mean, in total and for us; but so must we not confuse the subject of such treatment; for systems are not things, any more than a sholl of fish is anything more than a group of indiviudal minnows. "The latter being the true subject." 
            <br>&emsp;And in general, the era of science has broken off of ancient thinking, in that the subjects for judgement, or meaning rather, are not the meager concepts of earth and man, but particles. That, and all their effective systemization of once thought whole things: namely the mind and space. 
            <br>&emsp;In any case, Christianity was a pure development for man, as before all the beliefs of peoples was polytheistic: while the Christians saw a soul God. But just as I would not be refuted for not subscribing to the principles and or judgements of cave people, so am I not keen on the fashions of Christianity. Not because of their complexion, but their core; as the basis for them is not valid. There are apolagists, but there merely fitting a round peg into a square hole. And as the Scholastics sought to formalize the Christian doctrines, and before that the world was evaulated on the Christian understanding, so is the contemporary understanding the basis for our current evluations. And I see no reason why this is not a mere advancment of the contempary nature of Christianity at the time. Were all searching for the core of Nature, and at that the knowledge of what it means; as the former is further discovered, ought the latter change? I am simply current.
        </div>
        <div id="crumbsofthepast">
            All of our problems come from facing nature. In terms of what we need, competition, relief, these all surround it.
            <br>&emsp;But we think little of this, and unfortunately do not know when we've won. 
            <br>&emsp;In the past, poverty was not marked by a lack of bear and meat, but bread; and if they had so, then food was no longer a problem. And indeed, we worry about the means for such bread, but only that. 
            <br>&emsp;When I was younger, there was no advice given for such sakes, but rather the oppertunity we had. As the world was, we could take hold of it, earn more. Moreover, because such advice was born from prior mistakes, so were the new oppertunities seen as dear. "And we were told how oppertune they were, given the troubles to come."
            <br>&emsp;But in such a world, one which held such supposed means to relief, I already felt we had one. For the concern was not so much our ability to have home and bread, but vacations and goods. Those were the costs you see: new clothes, scumptious food, a back yard which we never used.
            <br>&emsp;And my feeling is, that although we fear no tigers, but still live amidst duties and demands in order to be safe, and that our time is otherwise open for us to promsingly be, I see both sides of these unchecked by any sense of security. "As if we had become prince, but were then under threat of not being king. Indeed, such a venture, despite the freedom to pursure, would hold its own demands: but as men, have we not already won?" 
            <br>&emsp;For it is one thing, as was often mentioned, that a boat could be purchased if you had a good job; and by that, the good of it is being professed. But it is another to say, that such a good job will remove the struggles of living. 
            <br>&emsp;But there is something missing; as if there are to many false assumptions. 
            <br>&emsp;We ought start with the basics, before we get to preference (or liberty). For indeed, the needs of food and bread sit atop of basic safety, in that we need air, and water at that. And as becomes cars, housing, education and what not, so are these, as means of progress or results, oriented around such basics.
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, we could describe our lives as rational when we've given up on simply reacting to the world, but acting with respect to some sort of understanding; that it works in certain ways, and at that yields us certain results based on our actions. The promise of agriculture is centered on this. And, seeing as agriculture is an organized effort, so ought we oblige. 
            <br>&emsp;In that way, our surival is always one of maintence, in that we are somewhat alert in order to run, or hungering in order to furnish our bellies. But when the basic need of food is met, so do we hover, as if the limit to our success is based on our own capacity, rather than the chances of supply and hunting. 
            <br>&emsp;This sort of success breathes oppertunity; or excess rather. As not all are in need of standing around, watching the grass grow. For food is not the only concern, but also water and shelter. I will permitt myself to conflate two aspects -since this notion is from a time ago- but the sentiment of housing, urban structure and governance, all come together as neccesarily motivating factors, along with those which procurre it. This is the anthropoligical form amidst natures basic demands of us. 
            <br>&emsp;Modernity has presented us with a bounty of goods and services; but they do cost us, or require something of us. And certiantly, these things are beyond our needs. And it may simply be so, that the prices of all these things corresponds with the price of all the things we need: as we do not barter for home and bread, but otherwise pay for pedicures with coin. All are part of the economy, or a system of exchange rather. And indeed, it is hard to bring together the production of goods, the paid labor to produce them, and the purchasing of these and the according tax, and the government spending and creation of services and structure. For one seems novel, in that we make wool linens and purchase them: while the government pays for education and medicinal research. As one's security amidst tigers opens them to the fear of a deeper mortality, so does the satiety of our bellies open us to the mending of illness. But the ethic is surely to make do with what you have; and at the very least hope for, and contribute towards, the development of goods which will further that. 
            <br>&emsp;Antibiotics are likely not possible (in their specified form) without the general assembly; which is itself motivated by the production of other goods. But still, entreprenerus are like the government, or core contributors, in that they see some want in the world, and invest themselves in order to fill it. A modern effect of this is that those involved see the profits available rather than the novel goods on offer ---investors, corporations. 
            <br>&emsp;I would make the point, somewhat faintly, that in the past, the advice of parent's was not to become a doctor or banker in order to have the benefits of such job, but to dearly provide for their families, and otherwise meet their needs fully. At least the sentiment was one of neccessity. But now adays, at least when I was a boy, such needs were seemingly a given, and the real suggestion was towards a profession with more novel benefits; at least, with the perks of being able to afford nice/fun things. But I saw, or at least was not so motivated amidst negativie circumstance, to discpline myself for such ventures. As their neccessity was never in place, and so I did not reverre them. Nor did the basic economics, over time at least, warrant a special regard for the future needs of others: for their own needs would not fail to be otherwise met.  At least, their needs were like mine, in food and bed; and as I cared little to work so hard (under stress) for a boat, so did I not place their own values as being such. And as it happened, so much goodness in my life came down to the activites I partook in; and these were of a recreatonal or leisurely sort, and at that not very demanding in terms of anythign but our time. Everything esle 'was real' under the rustic lense of old. But I saw little of it as anything but something good, rather than neccessary. Nor do I even see it as that good now.

            Systems are collections, aggregates, bodies of entities, which are themselves actual, definite, objects. 
            <br>&emsp;If we are talking about the former, we use statistics, in that the terms we use remark the aggegrate motions, such as those in a gas. While the motions of an entity are remarked through dynamics, in that we use terms to denote how it is exactly. 
            <br>&emsp;There are some concessions when speaking in this way, as referring to a system, such as the world, can hold no real weight or substance if (it being a system) it is not spoken of in such broader way. We may condense or summarize it, making it more of an entity, but so must we bring with that an according depth. And in part, we could distinguish the many systems within a broader one, and by that, have a system which is itself more defined. For instance, we speak of Man as an animal, and use anthropology to remark his historic happenings. Man is a system though; but in speaking of him definitively, we can address him as an entity. In terms of a gas, we may be definitive, but in a mere statistical way. In fact, it might simply be better to say, that statistics are a way to define a body of entities in relation to one another. 
            <br>&emsp;A trciky notion comes though, in that as we go broader and broader, the term everything, universe, entirety, existence and reality come to par. And this is an odd sentiment, as the aggregate of elements into a broader form is generally not something itself; at least, when we speak of it as it is, so are we doing so at a surface level; for the subject in question is in fact large in comparison to more basic things. "Molecules for instance, hold more basicness than tissues, but so are these more systemic than the particles which create them."
            <br>&emsp;And it really comes down to a universal principle. Imagine a soul piece of fabric, a wave, a body of mist, and how little ripples create discrete points, which by the rippling, produce relations between such points. Here, aggregate motion is made, and systems at that. But, in truth, there are no systems by this model, as it is really just the basic pieces acting amidst the other. The mass of this is only ostensibly so. "Fusion, for instance, binds atoms, and at that creates diffent kinds of atoms. But so do the atoms constituents remain." 
            <br>&emsp;So there is this confusion regarding the base principle and the subject of its aggregation. In part, the source for such aggregation, via the principle, is not entirely clear are easy to parse; as the motions of such princople, or whatever causes such aggregation in the basest of ways, is not something which seems plausible via something inherent. One way of describing this is by removing the 'seeming form' of the world --and not being tricked into thinking it is itself definite-- and considering, to the best of our ability, how base we can be in terms of the relations happening. Doing this with physical science is actually not so hard, via the modern understanding at least. Indeed such base it itself not understood; but via our method, we remove the explanation of birds, planets and iron, but rather particles and their constituent waves. For the aggegration of those is not itself misunderstood, in terms of how its derivations are made from such: all that is unknown is what births the derivation.
            <br>&emsp;I mean not to linger, but as we speak of the world as an entity, or whole, so do we speak of the princples output in terms of sensation, and how it, in terms of a seeming expereince, is produced. For me, this is the hardest question to anwser. For none can have there finger crushed and not feel pain. And even though neurology can describe the mechanism which produces such, why there is 'an experience, or feeling rather' of pain, is blankedly hard to tell. I'd suggest, as vision is best viewed under that 'basest' of lenses --whereby we appropraitely describe what we actually mean-- that so would pain and pleasure be best put under such treatment. When it comes to vision, I can describe light and its interactions with people, and at that, the granularity which the brain is subject to. And even though in that case, the actual seeing --however in reality it is 'effecively' composed (as not to seem, or be granular)-- is not itself known, that the composition of pain is not understood. By me at least, for neuorlogy can indeed describe it, as light mechanics and the eye can describe vision. The expereince is equally unclear, but of what, only one is definite. "The mystery of pain is a mystery of something I don't thoroughly know: while the mystery of vision, is in fact a mystery of something which I can fairly explain."

            So a man is whoever exhibits the characteristics deemed worthy. And such worth, from the core of it, is born from our relations with nature; in that she pressures us, and thus asks us to be a certain way. “Surely the character which we remark as good, is one which yields success.”
            <br>&emsp;The question though, is in terms of the progress of virtue, and how the ‘pleas’ of nature become further known; or there are new ones. For it is easy to ascribe one’s property within a function as the mark of virtue; the classic example being the purpose of a saw, in its actions at least, and how being sharp was a measure of that. But in that case, what if we were cutting different material, and different qualities of the saw were sought —in durability for example. The framework of virtue stays, but the statement of fact, or inspiration for the measure —the draw for virtue- changes, and thus which virtues are in demand.
            <br>&emsp;I say this, because like all animals, Man’s earliest ventures were one of heat, water and food. Transitioning from there to the needs of governance is a tricky task, as the process of technology and the means of using it is not easy to say. For we need at this point some marker of discovery, or principle which explains man’s acquisition of further functions. Better yet, an understanding of the world in terms of her opportunities, along with pressures placed by her which we did not know. That a volcano was a threat is perhaps something for an animal who is cultured and prone to tales; while God and salvation is a mere extension of that.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed our own inquiry needs more exactness in order for its general use to be proper. But we might say, from this point, that man has a function via the request of nature; which we might say is motivated by man’s needs, of which nature advertises a remedy. “The very fact that water may be in an unknown area, portrays the difficulty nature imposes -in the sense of lands and distance. But so does someones ability to navigate, and in tangent with that acquire direction (via smell in this case), reflect an possession of virtue: literally, by virtue of their ability to succeed. “A challenge sets, and those with virtue are relevantly effective.”
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps we could give some duration to what’s being said, and consider the difference between animals and men, in that one has not quite ever succeeded, while the other reached some point of success: and from there, furthered. 
            <br>&emsp;Indeed it is a matter of mechanics and definitions to properly state the developments of such success —as evident, via archeology for instance, and in principle, as in the general progress through various forms of tech and culture. Right now, our general principle is one of virtue and nature, and Man’s evident success as the one asked by the latter  to exhibit the former —i.e, effective traits. But as mentioned, the actual steps this partake, needs more exact principles as to generally speak of man in more detail. Broadly speaking, he initially succeeded and went from there. But of what initially point and why, and through each subsequent point, doth the depth of inquiry lay.
            <br>&emsp;I will not speak of such things specifically. But I will orient this baser depiction. That is, considering man’s early successes, as homo even, the common property of such success is that it was pre-ancient. I admit this is a blank term; but I say it if only to preface what I will now explain. Pre-ancient means that advancements are not cultural, but techonocligal. This itself may not fully demonstrate what pre-society is, but so can we contrast the two with the assessment of our place amidst nature, and whether we are simply maintaining the necessities that we already have (in method and extraction), or if we are simply improving at getting by. For animals never succeed, as they at best survive in order to procreate, then die. Their always in struggle though. At least, they never have any means but to try, and hopefully succeed. And man may indeed have been like that. But so much as he was, was he an animal; while his developments which gave him more ‘concreteness’ amidst those troubles of nature, makes him less so. 
            <br>&emsp;At this point however, comes the need to describe the transition between technology and culture. For one is made through excess, while the other is at best sufficient. If you imagine wild animals, their quest for food is always perpetual, in that they only have what they achieved that day, and have no definite means of succeeding again. Technology is man’s advent in order to revert that, whereby they acquire more than a mere instance of resources; or they have reliable means to get it again. By that, man became steady, or increasingly at least.  And from that, inch by inch, society lay. 
            <br>&emsp;The point I wish to make, is that as man acquired the first inkling of excess, so did the notion of ‘management’ come to be, as to better acquire such success (in quality of the means, and reliability of execution). But so did the question of ‘other’, be it near or far, come to be. If you could imagine, such excess, proprtioanlty, affords a slight amount of attention to be spent elsewhere. “Or not on the success at hand.” And in this state, lies kingship, belief and discovery.
        </div>
        <div id="homeandbread">
            So nature is a certain way, as are we. We ought not define either of those yet, entirely at least. Let us start with our observations, and at that experience; for the pain and pleasure I feel right now is quite indicative of what I should attend; at least, if I am injured, then what sense do I even have to wonder if something else should hold my amends.
            <br>&emsp;What we mean then, is that we have basic needs, namely food, shelter and water. And nature, making such needs, has been kind to incorporate her own being within our design, in that she has given us the tools to situate ourselves amidst her promising ways. In that, the means to success lies in our dance with nature, the virtue of which lies in how we take such steps. Doing so well, will yield us what we seek.
            <br>&emsp;But as we become ingrained to such motions, so does the trouble of warmth and satiety pass. Our care for it lasts; but our struggle in achieving so wains. As this happens, we open ourselves to other troubles nature presents;  or we apply ourselves to our current means, and make them more lucrative and accessible. 
            <br>&emsp;If you could imagine though a group of stranded people who have barely enough to survive, that despite their current state, that no stability lay. In that, there are but moments of satiety, but no sense of future security. It is the transition from this state within early man to one where his concreteness in the world is established, and he is no longer fleeing from tigers, nor clambering for scraps of food. In that lies management, as the perpetuation of such success is in need of more than a useful tool, but one to wield it; both in skill and employment. Admittedly, this age is not fully known to me, and so the extent to which this ‘managerial’ process took place is not entirely clear. But there is a distinction between ‘cultural’ troubles later discovered and the management of that. 
            <br>&emsp;In a way, people who gathered food were amongst those who could build shelter, find water, fight assailants and so forth. And as such, so long as kinship was present, so would the form of it surround such employments. As it were, as these were all duties and tasks, the matter of there being such things became an issue itself. For a group did not merely have to employ their members for the gain of resources, but had to orient themselves so that employment itself could be had. Because as further duties came to fruition, so did they get covered by the same organization of employment. 
            <br>&emsp;In that way, pre-ancient marks a time where there was no excess to inspire or warrant management. “For a tiger is not employed to the hunt, but rather driven, day to day. While a fisherman has a routine, and a reliable one at that —at least he looks for such a spot.” Ancient times are those whereby we surpass the basic quest from nature, and organize ourself to achieve so concretely. That, and as that solidifies, so do we add more employments. And modernity is when we’ve situated ourselves within natures final task, and no longer exist in her response. For the first metallurgist was a result of the first farmer. And indeed, the cares of the farmer, or trouble which his employment solved, gave those to-be craftsmen the openness to discover and see such opportunity. 
            <br>&emsp;What we’d better say is that man has come out of his animal ways, into a state of modernizing. Whereby he settled rudimentary layers, added broader ones, and let the latter settled into something solid, and further went by this routine. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, our state is best reflected in the custom of knowledge, and how what was once thought to be true relaxes, and accepts new truths. In whole, the tale of modernity, or that origin of kinship, is best summized by the earliest inquirers into indefinite things, and the abstract authority such things took, and the reign they held. I can’t say the source of the Greeks inquiry; though we can say that they acquired their ability to write from the Middle East. But uniquely, they were of a world which was, on the whole, well written. Their particular use of writing though, came from geography, in that their ‘managerial’ form derived from the land gave novel means to differentiate and explore. By that, as the earliest inquirers saw only that which they could with their eyes, so did those in the classical age use the spoils and method of writing. Only, prior truths held much sway, and inquirer into such matters —entirely at least- were not fostered. As the farmer permits those in the excess of such advent (in terms of hands needed), so did the stable kinship of the Greek states give a freer edge to their inquiry. “Those in the world at that time had no lesser means, rather the liberty to use it. The Greeks were merely fortunate enough to have enough civil freedom to explore (as man had done before) in contemporary ways.” 
            <br>&emsp;And indeed, the uniqueness of the Greeks is perhaps a mark of civil inquiry —using writing and past things written. While the roots of the world had been laid in the inquirers of old —the results of which only grew with time (as they could), and not with genuine reform- the conservative, if not convicted basis which such beliefs produced, gave no way for inquiries born of a newer age. Again, the Greek states gave enough freedom for such inquirers to be made. And while the rest of the world, initially inspired or not, kept down the traditional course, the pure inquiry of the Greeks still lay. And despite the more contemporary view of tradition (in the religions of high antiquity) so did the view born from modernity inspire those who later uncovered such riches. 
            <br>&emsp;At first the Caliphate found the greek texts, spurring an arabic renaissance near the tip of the millennia. Then, via the charm of that, and the connection (via the crusades) of the east and west, so did those Greek inspired goods re-enter the meditteranean. I must admit some ignorance, but as we all known, the mid way of the millennia saw a dispersion of many folk away from tradition, and into different forms of theology. And my ignorance lies in the connection between the greek inspired scholatiscim (as conducted by those of tradition), and those who saw such work as a motive to something other than such tradition —however revitalized by the greek methods.
        </div>
        <div id="manytasks">
            Virtue is a mark made by demands, in that, of the function which is laid out, so lays virtue by ones able hand. But so do such workers likely have more than one need —as remarks the demands. “Where is thy food? Over there perhaps? It would seem so, but guarded by natural fortuity —in distance, skill, Required time, insight.” That wall to what we seek, as shown by the friction between whats sought and satiety, is the speaker of demands; who says, ‘all those who speak right and well, will pass.” 
            <br>&emsp;But man is thus asked to say many things. He collaborates though with others of the species, as some may speak this language, that dialectic, those words. “By which the discourse between nature is had at multiple points.” For not even the smoothest of talkers could survive if their charm was only in the words of food. “For Posiedon must also be greeted, and the God of shelter at that — Hepheastus we’ll say.”
            <br>&emsp;I admit this is not sound entirely, but a fair principle could be, that man, in his sociality, is motivated and successful as so, by the collective virtue instated, and at that the plurality in points of success. “A true complexity of natural discourse.” 
            <br>&emsp;That being said, the conduct of man has never been so successful on the basis that there were others around him who held virtues he did not. This in itself is true, but is not the point where one thrives. Rather, the virtues of such collective, and at that the propriety in such variable employment, marks the true point of success. For in that, all needs are in question; and thus, the collective virtue is deemed remarkably so, if it is effective in such unity. If one part fails, then the whole does not succeed. And by that, so do the members without such means, personally fail. That is the dynamic of virtue in a team.  
            <br>&emsp;Indeed it is one thing to measure the accounts of such virtue; as one with a skill for navigation may simply be unhad. But it is another, that within the presence of a fully collective means, that so is the management of such collective a virtue in itself. 
            <br>&emsp;For the process of community is not so easy to say. As we must look at the early remnants of man, and primates at that, to see why the ability for communion is possible. But in terms of our principle, we could say that as one man achieves success in navigation, and another in the foraging of food, that reciprocally they share: as the spoils of one meets the needs of the other: and together, each of their needs are filled —via sharing. But if we could imagine that such harmony is based on an understanding of the other, in that one sees their ability to do one thing, like the other; and by each particular success, the bounty is shared. But as this shared employment ensues, so is there a remark about the needs of the communion. For the individual functions are acted as extensions from a common point —to which the shares are returned to. “I’ll go west for wood, and you east for stone: meet back here and we’ll share the flame.” But upon that, as each is settled amidst the shared goods, the question of sustaining such employment is wondered. At least, an inquiry as to the merits of proper management of such collective comes up. As one would level out a path to a reliable means of resources, so would a community establish within themselves the grounds and character to improve such collective. For there may be problems we could afford to solve, via the efficiency. That, or we may improve the means to the ends we’ve already employed ourselves towards. Better yet —though this may simply be how it happens, as opposed to being supposed— that our attention may catch onto things we had no prior awareness of. For people tend to get sick; but our collective is aimed primarily at gathering shelter and fuel. But so does the solidity of that afford some attention to remedying our illnesses. “Even past that, lies one who, upon sitting up from some ail treatment (to catch their own breath), saw a star twinkling in the sky. And what may that be?” 
        </div>
        <div id="neargoods">
            So I tend to make claims along the lines of virtue, rather than ideals. One sees the world theoretically, and orients it so that, if upon good action, preferred results would shine. While the other, simply adheres to the world as is. Moreso, the conditions which we adhere to are not altogether altered, in action or wish. 
            <br>&emsp;At that, the difference comes down to who we are as people, in that, of the good, it is through us in and how we are. While the goods of ideals, seem altogether arbitrary, albeit with strong intent. 
            <br>&emsp;It is hard to say though, for the goods of ideals are found in the realm of philosophy and civics. Meaning, that the ultimate notion of the soul is used as a principle, and ordained to us; with the gumption that we are set and known within such basis. “To which, our ideal good, is marked by our ideal portion of such basis.” But such an end is not about our heart and bones, rather the motions of our objective being upon the soul. “Which is to say, that transcendent or not, that our natural being is set (or sourced) upon something truer; of which theology and pure morality conjecture about.”
            <br>&emsp;That is one thing though, for the character of metaphysics and all its adjacent is not in any way simple to say. Virtue however, is much easier to expound. 
            <br>&emsp;For starters, the idea of virtue is, in its form, applicable to the real and ideal world. A saw for instance, has an objective form by which it is virtuous, or sharp; but it also has an ideal form, by which its principle purpose is exhibited; and virtue may be of such. Or in other words, the proper trait it exhibits may be with respect to its real or ideal form. 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, I mean to speak of real virtue. Or the property which best responds to the conditions we’ve experienced. “The nature around us, and what she’s shown and asked us to adhere to; rather than what we think, if we adhered to, would produced something ideal.”
            <br>&emsp;For the problem lies in the ends, and the gaze beyond who one simply is. For in that, I notice that a lack of food breeds insatiety, as will a lack of water leave me parched; and too little warmth similarly, or an excess of wetness.
            <br>&emsp;I say all this, for I mean to see the world as something we respond to, rather than surpass, and then oblige some further plea. There may be perils waiting for us, ‘sent by one who cared little that we had otherwise reached success’; whereby our damnation was due to ignorance and content — as if in terms of the world, we’d won. Equally, this sensibility may afford promise, in that, if we went past such ignorance, then we may reach further and or greener pastures.
            <br>&emsp;This is the true line whereby the critiques of the past meddle with the current scope of philosophy, and the increasing satiety and content of modernity. For in that reign, crumbles the principles of such ‘foreign’ fears and promise. For they seem either uncredible -and at that contrary- or are not so abundantly decent in their reward; as man, in his nature, cares little more than for a fed stomach, quenched mouth, warmth of a home and that of a friend, and a marbling of security and creative access. “It is a fair critique of those who suggest otherwise, that their motives are born from a lack of the former mentioned.” For there is indeed, historically, a damning statement by those who profess some greener pasture. “As if the current grove was riddled with rubble and despair.” Indeed this is true, for man’s belly is not always full; nor does any meal promise the next. “But the promise of satiety is what he truly seeks; rather than the possibility of goods which come outside such condition.” 
            <br>&emsp;A great deal of conflict has come by man starving himself down the path to the goods beyond: and those hungry later on, parlayed for the satiety of that. “At least, in fact, man has not beholdened himself entirely to the lands beyond the world, and at that his earthly need."
            <br>&emsp;But so lies the motive for humanity, that her brethren may be with fuel and stead. And as one alone does what they can with the tools they have, and a pair of others does so equally but for the gain of both, so is the collective of all people an extension of such efficacy, and the shared customs (as shown by the worth) for such community, so that it may be as ably run, holds but an association of personal agreements, ‘by the reciprocity that each member sees, in their offer and reward’. Virtue as I say, in this practice, is merely the demonstration of such intent by the people in such association. 
            <br>&emsp;This may be itself full of principles and ideal, but the basis is one of man, and at that it's possible mean of responding to nature. Generally, the conduct of the community may itself be extold. But the reality is, that such a community is merely a group of individuals exhibiting collective virtue. 
            <br>&emsp;At that, I mean only to start with words and custom as becomes me and my fellow man. This text is an illustration of that after all; and lives in the world of both my expression (e.g in letters or speech) and subjection (e.g gravity and need to breath).
            <br>&emsp;The past is not unimportant, but simply serves as a datum of experience. The vectors and eligibility of propositions are in full use here, whereby those who offered so a time ago, are measured by the methods used to determine today.
            <br>&emsp;Of an end though, which is seemingly forever conceded to, and at that in our efforts to define. 
            <br>&emsp;In that, the core virtue is one of real knowledge, in that someone is aware of and ordained to the character needed for the truest end. It may be one beyond the bounds of earth, and at that, the extent may be one that offers additional promise, or threat. But so, whoever knows, will be in possession of a proper guide. For with such knowledge, they hold the ends to which they must calibrate themselves towards. “Whereby real virtue is bound.”

But as much as their faculties can compute, so will their impressions apply.
            <br>&emsp;In this though, lies the kinds of knowledge one receives, namely those which are natural or supernatural. Of the former, these remark the repeated, or at least seemingly sequential occurrences of the world, and the inscription (by the viewer) of such sequence. The statement of such ebbs and flows amount to laws, in that by whichever basis, so are such motions produced. “And laws describe such motions.” 
            <br>&emsp;If the matter is not natural, but of a supernatural sort, all this means is that what one experiences is not an occurrence of nature’s sequence, but an instance instead. In that, lies the heart of miracles, visions and reactions from a supposed other world. An augur for instance, sees a birds flight and interprets that as meaning something for the natural world. “As if the tectonic plates below caused a motion of the bird, and gave the impression that other objects would be subject to a certain motion within their own relation to the plates.” 
            <br>&emsp;Distinct from that is a messiah, which is not merely an instance or act which corresponds with the baser motions beneath, but is an exhibition of such basis in object form. The bird that an auger sees is not itself an insight, but rather what such motions suggest of the basis below. A messiah on the other hand is akin to such basis taking on the form of a bird, and flying in a elaborate way: by which something clear and deliberate is given in terms of insight, rather than a conjectural supposition of what the flight of an ordinary bird means. 
            <br>&emsp;It is true though that such a prime being is not necessarily natured, for they may be a normal object (with communicative potential) which is intimately linked with the basis; or they be the basis itself, merely formed in a way that allows for communication. 
            <br>&emsp;In either case, the conduct of such being is one of alteration and insight. For they may literally turn water into wine, or share what God has told them. And it is not unreasonable to suspect that someone listening to the words of the latter does so because they’ve seen (or heard of) acts of the former. 
            <br>&emsp;In this though, lies the critical divide between science and divine based philosophy. For both, per the core of philosophy, seek a truth (and by that permit the presence) of something deeper than the surface level appearance of the world. “As if there were more than what we commonly saw.” But in terms of what they are trying to explain, or find the basis for rather (of such appearance), so does such subject come about through natural or supernatural means. For one who sees a miracle, or hears the words of a spirit, will seek the explanation of that. While someone who observes the moon’s motion’s, and ascribes such steps as reminiscent of dynamical laws, will seek the basis of that. As Newton said, ‘by whom and to whichever end I do not know, but of what is governed it is these motions; and such motions are understood by these descriptions.” Saying, in other words, that via such descriptions, we understand the objects which are under (or on) some basis.  Philosophy is the admittance of such basis, and not then a denial of the real world, nor an acceptance of rhythmic laws. To be fair, the things which the laws express, or illustrate, has no definite limit in terms of what can be known; nor is it unfair to suspect that as our understanding (and descriptions) reach greater depths, that the basis for such things will become known. Or, better said, that what we mean when philosophizing, that beneath even the understood surface, lies a basis to that; but so may the basis of that be itself definite, rather than metaphysical.  
            <br>&emsp;Metaphysics, or a transcendant basis, may be possible, or it may simply be real — or not meta, but definite, and not transcdenat, but entire within the reality which there’d be transcendence of. 
            <br>&emsp;In that way perhaps, it might be better to ascribe the confidence in the latter as a faith in reason, in that if we are to be complete in that way, then we will have understood and explained all things within reality —with no transcendent need. 
            <br>&emsp;Bringing this back, it is all too common for ‘supposed’ instances of things not seemingly real, to serve as either indicators or proof of something transcendent. Beyond the source of speech and thinking, the alteration of water into wine is not something which, in a pure reality, is consistent with the rest of things. Thermodynamics for one, does not permit it.

            What we are going to assume, is that man is an animal, and at that something with needs; which is to say a relation with nature, who both supplies and demands (in efficacy); moreso, has she gracefully made us with those tasks in mind, and at that formed us to be in need of the results of such task. This is what we are.
            <br>&emsp;We also must assume that we are social animals, in that of such tasks, we both recognize the worth in cooperation and have the means to do so. In this lies a property of virtue, namely the resourceful aspect of it, in that if one is in need of food, then the virtue required is not only in character but ingenuity, in that the route to such ends can be seen, but executed on to. For example, if one’s ingenuity can see that a shell is liable to be smashed (and offer the food inside), then the trait which provides such recognition is in need of a paired trait of dextrousness, and at that craftiness, in order to conjure and harness the thing which smashes. All in all, our recognition of cooperation is one which requires the ability to see others as viable benefit, and then act in ways that facilitate such unity. “Mans basic social virtue is in seeing others as allies, and treating them with as is appropriate for reciprocity.” And beyond the smaller locale, a broadening of such union may neccessitate collective virtues, as to permit organization of the many, and at that the concession of each to the whole. “This extent of man’s basic social virtue is perhaps one of reproach and sense, in that two hands being better than one may be so in the furthest sense, but thus require the facilitation of such community. To which man’s baser virtue is paired with a sense of reason, as to consent to the will of such virtue.” 
            <br>&emsp;At that, it is fair to say that man must be reasonable so much as he is virtuous, for what the latter suggests (in proportion to its scope) bears weight upon the formers presence, as to guide what may otherwise be contrary to the promise of such virtue. “Wait my friend and see, and your conceit to such community will bear fruits greater than your own impulses and effort.”
        </div>
        <div id="swordandhand">
            As it were, this sense of collective virtue is not itself a marker for an age. Man may be social and collective, but in a merely minor, if not local degree.
            <br>&emsp;What separates primitive man from those ancient is in the unity of such locales; so that a tribe has to deal with other tribes, and at that convene. Surely the transition from primitive to ancient ways saw times where such ‘convening’ was unfruitful. But eventually communities bigger than tribes ensued, becoming states, and empires of those. 
            <br>&emsp;It might be fair to think in terms of civility, and by that recognize villages as the earliest civil communes. Their comparison to a tribe is not clear, but the presence of infastrastucre is surely a dsitnguihshing factor. 
            <br>&emsp;What we mean then, is that villages, or civil communes, interact with those of the same sort, and at that, broaden the collective into something akin to a state, or kingdom. These, to be clear, are what empires are composed of, in that the realms of Africa, Spain, Italy, France and Central Europe constituted the empire of Rome. While each province was a mesh of smaller (village like) constituents.
            <br>&emsp;At this point, I am not clear on the ideals of a collective beyond that of a village. And historically, it seems that such attempts were more on the selfish end. And I must admit that the peculiar facts of that are not known to me.  “Perhaps I wish not to grieve over such ‘conquests’, and at that graze over this state of empires and states.” 
            <br>&emsp;Beyond the impetus, it is somewhat fair to presume that such union of smaller collectives was done through conflict. Indeed, I can see the value in the world as it is; at least it seems unlikely that a plethora of villages would each build their own factories and transmit systems. Thus there seems merit in higher collectives by virtue of the greater amount of resources that the administrators can expel. I also think that the impetus for ancient collectives was mystical, in that those of higher rank in the smaller communes were seen as exhibitors (and at that earthen judges) of the Gods; and that by the convicted quest to have all foreigners (alike the natives) submit to such King, so the impetus lay.
        </div>
        <div id="manssprout">
            As it were, lands that united themselves into kingdoms and empires, grew more reach then those which remained ‘pastural and village like’. This can explain the ability for Europe to colonize the Americas, despite there being people present. If such folks had extended the scope of their community, then so their stamp be in place. But a countries power far supersedes those of individual clans. 
            <br>&emsp;In an equal manner, the legacy of knowledge pours from those who acquired the most of it. And those who could, did so according to their means, in both skill and liberty. For the freest thinkers of primitive times had nothing but their wandering gaze —and broad definitions. While those with precise language and the method of writing could ask and ponder in more elaborate ways. “For more had already been via written hands.” But so do such means require the freedom to use them. And past the advent of culture -and its mystical side- so were blanked questions discouraged —fatally in some instances. 
            <br>&emsp;Along these lines, the Greeks were part of a time which had come from the prior age of Mesopotamia -and her findings. From this, beyond any derived context, they strictly found the means for writing. Paired with that was the structure of their states, which were quite stable due to their limits via geography. From that, nestled a relatively high amount of freedom to pursue both inquiry and craft. Per the former, the Pre-Socratics, Sophists and Hellenes lay. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the lands around Greece progressed as all others had civilly, namely in the lining of states into empires. In the case of Greece, the Northern realm of Macedon incorporated those in the southern peninsula. And those by the Romans forthwith. 
            <br>&emsp;I cannot speak to the civil state of the Arabs, but via the uncovered Greek texts they were inspired to in the ways they inquired, or that they should inquire at all. Regardless, a middle eastern age of inquiry ensued. And to those later associated with them did the spoils (of prior Greek thought) continue. 
            <br>&emsp;The point, is that the world operates a certain way. And generally, most of it behaves in the same manner. Only, the reason for any present motive is likely born from some past initiative —i.e. the primitive notion of a leaders divine right, and at that endowment to all property and folk (be it foreign or native). But, the natural expression of people outside antiquate ways, makes for developments which stick around, ‘even when such folk are smothered by the surrounding states and their tradition’. 
            <br>&emsp;Indeed, this is the mark of the Greeks, in that they were simply those of higher ancients who purely thought. 
            <br>&emsp;But the question is of our civility, and the manner in which it broadens, and for which ideal end. For I want to say that the current state of the world is simply one born of all the pieces settling together, and at that by an age which was prompted up (initially) by such decree to expand, and at that vie for lands and right. “All those native, born and led by such decree, saw all things beyond them as property of theirs. At least to be.” Indeed, as remarked by those broadly conquesting, that those who lived in their sought for lands were but barbarians, and sometimes savages. For the latter marks a sort of perceived conduct of a people; while the former term is but a disintciton between those native and not. “They are barbaric who are not of us.” Which is indeed a relative term, and at that possible within any character —as all can see who they are, and who is not.
        </div>
        <div id="fruitsofsettlement">
            The notion of locality, and at that nativity, within early tribes, is to me an anthropological mark of people. Just as we assume, or at least mention our ability to socialize, so ought we include the notion of fear, and of what. Whatever then spurs conflict is one thing, or for what ends rather, but that there were ‘others’ is not surupisring.  “Collective virtue has never been a matter of people, but our own folk.”
            <br>&emsp;The reality though is that collectives are governed beyond their basic ends. And by that it is important to note how certain issues become addressed through the collective. In that lies the mystical findings of man, and the incorporation of such truths into the functions which the tribe provides. 
            <br>&emsp;For it has been said that community allows for efficiency, and at that spexiliaztion; either in the ways that current things or done, or for new things which get noticed in this state of excess. By my accounts this is where spirits and folklore were born. The details regarding it, as in the case of the motive and effects of food and conquest, are not known. But it seems fair (as in those others) to fit in generally. 
            <br>&emsp;If I knew more, I might be able to mingle conquest and piety together. It seems that the heart of the latter came about prior to any extensive acts of the former. I cannot say entirely though that said latter caused such former acts. Those seem to be based on a discrimination of whats native and foreign. The motivation could be to destroy such things beyond the locale, or to assimilate them. At least their views may be self involved, in that they thought they had rights to all —partocualry of those in leadership roles. Divinity surely had an influence then. 
            <br>&emsp;Overall, it is not hard to see that as the bounds of earth were settled, and for whichever reason conflated —first into villages, then kingdoms, empires. And such states brought with them that tradition of piety. Which by my accounts is the source of all things bigotry. For it is one thing for ‘all things foreign, or not native’, to be deemed a threat; as not even deer are accepting of much more than their local herd. It is another though, for the motions of such discrimination to have antagnositc motives curried by religion. Thats not to say there isn’t conflict born from natural ends. But of the direction born by religion, I’d say the source of elitism and genocide spring from there.
            <br>&emsp;Again, the discirmante conduct of man is more or less natural. Only, the twisting of such impressions can make the destructive interests moreso, or at least create a classist attitude regarding those assimilated. 
            <br>&emsp;Better said, the separation between folk is one thing; but religion, and or piety born of a certain locale, only makes those within that locale more unique, and at that inherently different than those around. And whether such difference spurs elitism or genocide, so is the native sense one of further distinction (regarding all thats foreign).

            Ideally, we’d know how things come together, and thus have some guide for the time ahead the present. 
            <br>&emsp;But this seems unnecessary, and at that not to be so. For we have said, generally, that considering our need to breath, eat and sleep, that so hath nature given us the means to such ends; but in that, required of us to be a certain way, principally (as in disciplined) and with skill.
            <br>&emsp;The question, is if a group of individuals exhibits collective virtue, what does that mean for the individual themselves? Perhaps the modern source of this conundrum, whereby the form of such collective is off, brings up questions of bravery and protest.
            <br>&emsp;But in that, I see but a moment ahead, and at that one’s vitriol in the imbalance of that moment to be. In terms of the future, so does momentum and trajectory lay. And by that, the vitriol of the moment is exchange for calmer virtues; one’s which exhibit themselves with respect to the whole of our days, rather than the evident moment. 
            <br>&emsp;Its important to note, that by the annals of consistency of anisotropy, that the form of things at hand bears more assumptions than the natural need (and our according natural presence) to eat and sleep, but also sense, worry, fear, and by that see beyond what is definite and clear, in those things of an abstract or mysterious sort. As man’s expression had the time and developed means to paint bulls on the wall, so was he able to express his notice of the sky, the moon, devastation, and common disturbances such as illness or death.
            <br>&emsp;It is important, and at that interesting, to explore the basis of these assumptions —in our needs and impressionability. But I’d say, for the moment, that we can merely express that collective virtue is one, that in all senses of frailty, ought one fix such, or address it at least.
            <br>&emsp;For one permits themselves being equitable within the collective, and by that, subject to the custom of such collective -be it in the vibes of each member, or those which are determined, and at that managed. 
            <br>&emsp;Besides any recent examples, it is our point to note that one’s place in the collective is not entirely made by their reasonable exceptence of its ways, but in that a more civil reward from their participation; and at that, a liberty to do as they leisurely, craftily and or curiously please. Mistaken truths cause friction here; but our ideal remains. 
            <br>&emsp;This is where I struggle. For the American dream is that each member has the rights and freedom to pursue what they please. And by that, each family which comes, be it with nothing or a historic all, can act liberally, and at that via their own interest. What is proper though, is that such interest be in line with the ways of the collective. Despite holding the right to suffrage and thought, so mustn’t they committ theft or assault, and at that coerce someone to doing something out of custom. 
            <br>&emsp;My ignorance though prevents me from stating the ‘inhumane’ policies instigated or disgenuine activity. Are corporations a vice to the collective, and at that preachers and belligerents. Saying who these are, and in by which whole educate, is not easy to say. Though much public information is. Expressed around such disputants. 
            <br>&emsp;I can only say, that if someone is wrong, or inappropriately behaved —for none, outside the military, have any permission to commit violent acts- that their place in being so within the complex of the industrial age is one that wholly derived from baser principles. And necessarily, the various parts of that complex ought be considered when we judge those involved in such level. For in the collective virtue, their may arrive the presence (and by that submission) to a charter, whereby certain rules and custom are agree’d upon for the functioning (and at that benefit) of the collective. In that though, there may be additional posts, such as the facilitators of such laws, and the judgement of those in contrast. Here lies the birth of courts, and at that administrators of the collective policy. By this decree, the need of which is born from the agree’d upon structure of the collective, so is the employment of such role in need of one’s compribale in such task. Thus came legislators, litigants and judges. 
            <br>&emsp;My point, is that if we are to judge a litigant and the the quality of their litigating conduct, ought we know the form and virtue inbided which such person is evaluate against.  “What is a good lawyer, and a proper one at that? And ought we have our own sense of why there is propiety at all, and at that contextual aims (for which virtues are valued traits).”
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, this is just a method of propiety, in that we hold our criticisms and contrition at bay, less we have a solid basis to judge on. What the real question is, or the main one, is the duty of those in the collective to partake in such roles of litigation or legislative creation —and so forth to military operations, civil engineering and so forth. For it is one thing to say that a litigant is bad; while it is another to say that, all things considered, that my place as a non litigant is not to do with the business of litigation. At that point, it is perhaps right that such realms of the collective ought have their own committees and checks, as to suitably manage such affairs. For my place as a shoemaker does not imbibe me with the proper sense of a litigants abilities or conduct. But this evaluation need not be self managed, or at least internally managed (by other litigants), but by a focused group of those educated in the proper ways of such litigants; and like a enforce and or official of the law, who holds reign over those breaking it, so do such monitoring committees serve as a suitable enforce over the field of litigants.

        <div id="drivingforce">
            My thoughts always come back to virtue, in that we are all subject to something, and at that, virtuous by our effective oblige. What this is in contrast to is hard to say; but perhaps a fair note is that the things were subject to, truly, are not able to be changed, merely responded to.  The difference is seemingly one of history, and how people see the obligations placed upon us as done so though the wills of other people; and at that seem liable for change.
            <br>&emsp;This is not base enough, by my counts. For indeed, laws, states, economies and office have come about; and beyond their own arrangement, so has primitive thought influenced the succeeding generations involvements (in such arrangement). But the source of this all is upon those base necessities; which even upon the fairest of states, still rests upon the unyielding demands of nature, and at that our virtuous oblige.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, false pretence has born a lineage of native divinity, and at that a contrast was those of other nativities. This has been incorporated into the sense and structure of modern states; at least the former quality was part of the classical irons, while the latter was ingrained to those medieval. Even though industrial states have rid the premises of such tradition, so do the liberated folks have no lineage of their own. Despite the lands being at liberty for them, so are they incapable, by their previously held position. “Thus the critique’s of modernity lay; not in their motive and course, but the history of those partaking in the lanes: and some being steady footed compared to others.”
            <br>&emsp;This is an odd sentiment. For the specifics really don’t matter. Instead, the notion of virtue is binary in its address, in that we either head for the ideal, and let the validity of that even things out; or we locally, or via the moment address, and at that resolve ourselves to the status of the collective, rather than its end. 
            <br>&emsp;For the inequality of folk is more or less born from classist mindsets. That, and the idea of locality, and the ceasing domain beyond such borders -by which those outside are not of right. Conquest arrives here, as does slavery.
            <br>&emsp;But let’s consider for a moment a native family, who is not subject (or has been) to retched inequities, but simply held lineage in the heart of a powerful land. If they are workers in an economy, then what ought they receive in terms of sympathy?
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps its better to remark the reasons which distributed custom and roles within the baser societies, and at that, made way for states which proliferated the inequity we see today. 
            <br>&emsp;For my belief is that, beyond something true, that the inequity towards those of contrary sexes, orientations, faiths or ethnicity, is purely born from a compounded culture of ignorance, mistaken pretence, and by all that, an evident lack of inquiry —for none without the clasp of common consent, thinks purely and sees people as anything but equal. 
            <br>&emsp;And thankfully, the validity of the ancient ways gave way to the want of something more reputable and modern; by which pure attempts were made (with modern means) to assess the world and what it means. Whereby, the notion of religion remains, but beyond ancient views; along with liberty becoming present; and developing truly by the friction of precedence, and at that the world’s status as would permit (admittedly young liberal) views that bore complete equity. 
            <br>&emsp;We have reached this purity though. At least, we as in those common and or reminiscent of the West. Here, and by all alike, the affairs and being of sexes, orients, faiths and ethnic identities hold worthwhile truth; and by that, are accounted for equally within the basis by which collective virtue lay. “For there are none who we’d call man, who do not measure to the status of members, and at that contributors to citizenry and rule.”
            <br>&emsp;It is only our nearly modern case, whereby the finishings of this war (of new and ancient) is but a battlefield of wounded and deprived. For indeed the battle for humanity is won. At least our demise is all together. And beyond the cares for our lasting time as one’s whole and of unity, so is such union full of stragglers, and at that those bolted behind. For some can not even partake in the liberties now given. “For many paths require one to be so tall, liquid, able.” And the result of those liberties being unpresent prior, means that some people have nothing -and thus have no means to begin. 
            <br>&emsp;I am not sure if this is just part of the collective, that it would account for and service what it can those who were let down by its prior inefficiency. Veterans seem to be treated this way. At that point though, besides the efficiency of our fortunes and excess, what is the course for those with nothing? What resources and or opportunities are available for people in that state? “In this newly open world, where is the potential for those whose first step is to begin?”

            What is the purpose of all our efforts? Is it not the liberty of all, to see and do as they please? 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps, it is truly bring our nature in line with that the world, for harmony. There the gift of virtue lies, in liberty namely, and at that peace.
            <br>&emsp;But the ebbs of our nature is such that the attempt to harmonize brings fear; as our motivations based on mystery bear upon us further confusion, and at that reserve. By some mechanic the truth comes out, and our hesitance seeps. 
            <br>&emsp;I just wonder if we always knew that there were no Gods, and that the mechanics which bore us need for breathe also bore the air and currents, that the efficacy in meeting such needs would be a complete and utter success. For I believe the tales tell us that meeting the demands of our animal needs bore insight to further problems: namely death and the pleasing of God. But so much of the reoncilliation with that has created depravity, ‘as everyone push each other aside in order to reach the top’.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the aim is always reconciliation, but of our nature with the world. In that lies an evident prosperity.
            <br>&emsp;The oddity of man is in his attempts to solve ‘ancient problems’ -as compared to those primitive and innate, that much of the struggle to modernity arrived.
            <br>&emsp;In a broad sense, the peril of the stone age was in those unable to harmonize with nature -whereby they’d starve and whither.  While the modern peril is one where people fight each other, ‘like two babies yanking at the same toy’. The motive is the same, but the ancient sentiments bring false pretence to ‘others’, and their right to be, or at least be equal.
            <br>&emsp;I do admit some ignorance in the function, or at least mechanism by which fear is produced. But I submit the notion of a nightmare, and how impressionability, unfamiliarity, and an otherwise lack of similar (if not associated) definition, can lead to such conception. “If only in a dream.” But so, in life, can we be misled, or mistaken at least, and by that deem something to be problematic; or at least feel a problem is present. “For it is not a far stretch to describe earlier points of man, where he not only say the volcano as a threat, but an instigator of it.”
            <br>&emsp;If were thinking ideally, or at least in terms of virtue, then we can presume the notion of communal harmony, or group relations, and how the mistaken actions were done in such relations, or at least internally following combination.
            <br>&emsp;In that way, it is hard not to say that if your part of a community, and some of its members are suffering from previous struggle, that your part of the collective is in helping them. At least, as you act with the collective in mind in positivity, so ought you act with it in mind if there are parts of it which have succumb to negativity. “Normally, we win, and share the spoils; and collective virtue is submitting yourself as to be equal to others. But if we loose, then we at best hold eacother up in our loss, and persevere through the trouble. And if some of us are fine, then perhaps our role is to help those who are not."

            Our liberty is a weird thing, for we never truly have it. Even if we thought, ‘well, how lucky are we, to have this job, these means, and the life that goes with it’, so would other hurdles come our way; for our finances don’t impact our vulnerability to sickness, injury, loss, nor death. And at that, the actual quality of our lives, in terms of the means of it all being agreeable and light, and the good in it being accessible, broadening and scrumptious, does not come via cash. 
            <br>&emsp;What I ultimately seek is stability. For my contributions are one thing, and indeed the core of our life is screaming for such purpose. But this really comes because of an inability to be ourselves; which I can only say comes about due to the choices we’ve made.
            <br>&emsp;For whichever reason, we’ve become generous and wise. And in doing so, we’ve invited indifference or critique; and at that, error in our way leave us vulnerable to such friction. But the primary course we’ve taken is one that has oriented itself based on those experiences; whereby what was good  was that which came from our propriety, while the bad was either in the erros of such ways or the conflict which such state of ours brought. Just as we are averse to television and chicken, so are we withdrawn from the conduct of others. Who I care not if they are not great; nor do I mind their indifference. But when my actions become an imposition towards them, or they simply refute and or deny the choice I’ve made and their worth, then I feel like our environment is hostile. “Like a gay man walking around, acting straight, but feeling resentful that their expression is necessarily dull —by fear at least.”
            <br>&emsp;But via this course, despite its wonder and glee, so have we departed from the common rungs of life. We have no real relationships, nor are we involve with anything beside our interests; that, and we have no profession or civil means. And beyond the wish to validate myself, and at that settle into the ‘indifference’ which I experience from others —as to remove such negativity, and take part with them (from our confidence)— 
            <br>&emsp;What I have is a path which knows its place, and holds little regret or pretence as to the confines ahead. I see however, that our choice is in front of us; and indeed, as one dreams of a profession, or a home, or travel, so do I see an end of stability; for in that, we can rest, knowing that such peace we’ll have. And, like all paths, it becomes easier in the present knowing that your on one; for current choices have a propriety which is not purely based, but built into some course forward. “Giving a permit to liberty and rest, for we see where else were obliged.”
            <br>&emsp;As it were, reaching that peaceful part of the path is simple as being where I can be myself. And indeed, this is not a point of absence, merely appropriation. For my parent’s are no longer suitable roommates; as their lack of overlap with any basic property is one that makes the kind of actions we take around them, dry. So I mean not to live at home. And I will admit that when I think of where too then, that the idea of a place with many other things is exciting. 
            <br>&emsp;But it really is a scenario of stability which I seek. The garments of opportunity and fun are nice, but appeal little to me in our greatest gait. I really just want a place that is hospitable, and at that lush. For any place will do; and living with your mom and dad will always permit the least room, ‘for their nature per the family is one of unbridled intimacy; as they treat you not like a person, but a son, a family member; yet they also act with free admittance, as if nothing is expected of them’. And indeed this is often fine, for I don’t mind being agreeable and pertinent. But so in our imperfect ways, and even the expression of the propriety into our thriving state, is one that hardly finds productive reception; or plain acceptance.
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, I mean not to live with our family. It is just to hard to be myself. And the benefits of doing so are not sufficent anymore considering they afford. Nothing which we could otherwise do is worth being averse towards. And seeing as the gain of being at home (and free) was that so we could concentrate on me, so is the constancy of that wishing for a place to actually be, ‘for the development is cemented’. That, and the freedom which afforded this is no longer a surplus over the required efforts to support ourself. Those efforts are in some ways rewarding, and beneficial at that; but so is their demand not so drearing anymore, considering our strength form such constancy. And I felt this before, but whatever toil there was, held worth by the nature of the being which such efforts supported.
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, I will keep to our path of personal propriety; for even beyond the nurturing of it, so are the goods around it able to sunk into. Preference then, in terms of locale and flow of itinerary, is part of this process, in that of our every day, so ought the goods and duty around mesh with our propitious efforts and craft. “I seek a place that would, in full, house and or enrich our common pace of being.” 
            <br>&emsp;Further, the breadth of our expression is in par with the desires one seeks. In that, of the good there may be abundance,but so in our time there may be romance, friendship, expertise and broader virtue. These things are inky though, as their promise may be a draw to your idle passions. But so, prior to the extent of such ambition -in business, power, fame, credulity- lies those former elements, of which your ordinary place in society can procure. For desire, with a the smell of that which otherwise draws our passion, so do these occupations rise. And indeed, I may not feel or care for such passions and occupations. But increasingly at least, beyond the zeal of our propriety, is a sort of excess in character that allows for communal participation; whereby the moderate act of making friends, attending meet ups or group chats, even putting yourself out there for romance, become fair and tenuale.

        <div id="hometrouble">
            I find myself souly frustrated with my parents because of their lack of interest in what I want. They'd jump in front of a car to save me, and are quite generous at that, but they rarely ask me waht things I want, or what I am apprehnesive about.
            <br>&emsp;Much of my later adolescnece has come about through me trying to clarify such notions. Which, to be clear, was never about affirming it to my parents, but rather solidifying it to myself. It is true that I have spoken with them from time to time, and over the years, our general interests have reached a point that they understand. But for the most part, our lack of rich cooperativness with them, or core understanding, only made me eager to cement whatever such things were. If we had been asked more about such things, then we might have been fine to sit with the common understanding. Seeing as there wasn't any, I sought to explore and define what things were. 
            <br>&emsp;The point being, that I did so out of fear, but also anger, in that the basis for suggestions I'd receive felt off --deep inside at least. And so I sought to clarify, as not to smittenly revoke, but rather clarify the strong grounds my inclings were felt to be.
            <br>&emsp;Where I stand now is on a world stage, completey fine in our views of myself, family and community. But so the rest of humanity lay. And indeed, our parents lack of regard for me when it comes to my interest or care for such things, curries me into defining that for myself. As the central theme of this, as that so long as your part of a family, so will older memebrs have influence over you; and as much as you don't appear in harmony, so will you feel apprhensive. And as it happens, our escepade into personal defintiion, only led me to live freely in such a way. But given our choices, so are we at home with our parents; and from that, there broader views are crossing mine. And because they feel so off from those of mine which spring from our own deep propiety, I have then worked to define such broader views: if only to rest and or converse in a truly sincere way.
            <br>&emsp;On one hand you have the everlasting struggle to agree, and the fair course of inquiry is not one that many exhibit. If I wish to live peacefully though, or at least with decency amidst our proper place within the world, then so ought I know what that means. In that lies our fidelity to the enormity of the world, and our reproach to the all extensive contents in it. Remarking on such material is where I hold my tongue, and at best think, or learn; while the address and adherence to the broader structural fact, is where my propiety lies. Indeed, if I had a moral truth, then the specifics of such structure could be sought, or driven towards at least. But so much as I am in this formative state, so do I at least rest on the fact that of such enormity (in strucutre), the world is.
            <br>&emsp;This is all in part due to our struggle in being alone. For by whicever roots, we have prioritized knowing ourself, and at that the world which we are angled against; and of such demonstration of who we are. Which, to be clear, has never been fought over. But in our formative ways, whereby we are in a state of further finding who we are, that is where disharmony is found. For most people I deal with, have no sense of further finding themselves. And as such, it is as if their waiting for me to finally reach who I am, and thus be. "For action is all they care about." 
            <br>&emsp;Ultimately, I am stuck between the solitude of my choices, and the novel ways of expressing my propiety. Such ways have only come in retrospect, and our common moments are ones of self interest and practice. In this state though, the future is perhaps all to clear yet far, and as we wait to go where we are fair to be, we see the everpresent process of being ourself as one of disharmony. For in such state, we are not entirely sure who we are; and indeed, this constant questioning is from our choices, in that whoever we are, we cannot entirely express that at home. "And deeper down the inquiry lays." 
        </div>
        <div id="whatguidesme">
            Understanding is a strange thing, as I only seek it when we are without forward motion. Naturally, our being goes, at least with nature's flow. But when were stiff, or stuffy from the ebbs of our current day, so do I seek some sort of bond with the world. 
            <br>&emsp;What I find, is that without some sort of grip on things, I whither, or hanker for such a grasp, and at that feel restless: as if I am seeking, or tightly holding on. While I am, in being that is, so is the world there, for my action is amdist something, like friction or air drafts that lift a kite. Generally speaking I feel this while I am truly alive, and such an expereince exhibits to me the proper course to be. "As if I were a bird who had never flew, but then caught a gust of wind and took full flight: by which I knew who I was, what I was right to be doing, and at that, what nature was in my righthouess in terms of me: and, per the basis of nature whiich produced my own specific sort, so did the heart of nature lay. As if a layer soul rooted in by a tree, and the trunk which held our particular branch."
            <br>&emsp;But understanding, is something which strikes me in our less than soaring state. For in such case, my senses are at one with the medium, and by that, my urge to know is absent, for I already am --and seek thus not. But then even, when I hit a riley gust, and am carried without needing to flap, or simply find a perch to rest, I reflect, settle, and at that, see the milder portions of life amidst me,  having been already amongst the broader currents which broad my fullest self to be. 
            <br>&emsp;This is like life in a way, that without the deeper prescence of living, so can little build off of that, and sprout. "There can be no moss without a tree." 
            <br>&emsp;And what I've noticed incessantly over the years, is that life is not something which is best defined by some core statement of nature or me, but a sort of character which permitts itself to be as it is whole-hearteldy; whereby the primary modes of its being reach full stride, thereby giving a sort of life to the body as a whole. By that, it is able to exist, 'as if therre were some neccessary amount of momentum, for it would otherwise stop and cease'. 
            <br>&emsp;Through that, though I can not entirely say, lies what can only be described as more novel and or muted motions within nature, and at that an association with the sides of nature which pair with such milder ways. This is akin to a bull, in that it moves in a way that reflects its horns, and the modes of defense and or fighting; or a lion and its nature to hunt, or Man and his nature to craft and inquire. But ought death be part of this, or sleep, rest, satiety? These are like a sword in its sheathe, in that totally, the sword is the same, yet considered to be via its core function to swing and strike; whereupon its exhibition of its proper self, bears it a sort of existence which is constant, if not propelled and or in motion by being itself: and all beings need rest. At least, if there was nothing which drew the need of a sword to strike, then it would likely be left on the shelf, for it had no need to be; but in use, it has its sheathe, where it exists complimentary to its primary purpose.
            <br>&emsp;I cannot say though. For I believe that our fears guide our tradition, and by that, less we commensurate antiquated ways, then we are left without an understanding of our own. This is so, for life is not always demanding, in a way which we cannot help but address. 
            <br>&emsp;Our choices have come from fortune, in that our own propiety could be focused on. We needed no room to do this, but saw value where fortune permitted.
            <br>&emsp;Again and again it comes back to our own thinking. In that, without the truth of the world, or some inquriy into that, we are left with the irksome despair of not being ourself. For without such motion, we are subject to others misfortune, raw mentality, cheap contentment, and rude monerging and discipline. By our counts, we saw and harmonized ourself with the hues of nature which seemed both bright and resounding, 'and cared little for what seemed but reflections'. In this though lies the harshest way; for there is both too little which we can afford to ignore or benefit from. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps then I will say. Whatever life is, there is nothing which explains it that a miracle or moral reasoning serves. As we understand the prescence of disease and orbits around the sun, so does our search for deeper truth hold promise. But from what I can tell, the investigation into this is still present, and at that any artfull expression or iqnuriy about it. In fact it is all too contemporary for the former aspect to be overlooked. "And for those in search to be unaware of their beleif that the final anwser is right around the corner." 
            <br>&emsp;We are so confident though, as if the topics of interest we hold so dear, are seen by me without tradition in mind. I take for granted that we will die, and by that seek some sort of grasp on the matter. But in all truth, where my heart lies is in the preciousness of our experience, the felicity of it, and the grand serenity whhich tailors the entire way. This is indeed hard to describe, 'as a deep and shallow breath are not something so clear or common to compare'. Yet, the birth of wisdom sits in the cradle of persoonal knowledge, and the propitous sense that durnkedness, poor punctuality and senseless shame and sedition all lead to uneven and course life. While honesty, virtue and the dearest care exhibit the purest of strenghts and sobriety; the latter being the spring for one's relation with the world. "I just can't illustrate the way that I breathe deeply when the birds are singing, compared to one's obvious pleasure in mac n cheese."

            The core of me may be someone who is lazy, concieted and ashamed.
            <br>&emsp;The root of this may be born of something which does not damn me in being such a way; but still the effect lies.
            <br>&emsp;The struggle in being yourself is an odd thing. For we are all more or less raised, and at that asked to be something; and as much as we aren't we are ushered, and of the route we take, the affront to others expectation returns us with shame. 
            <br>&emsp;And indeed, there is a sort of comfort we experienced throughout our youth, of which we held no other care for in terms of broader/future concerns. When such points were brought infront of us, the importance of them had me feeling a little small and unsure --considering our lack of grip on them. 
            <br>&emsp;But with content I flew, drifting through the days, 'letting the future's prompts arrive'. 
            <br>&emsp;For whichever reason, our choices along the way made me less able and interested towards such prompts. And our mild grasp on them drew discontent from others. 
            <br>&emsp;I can only describe our personal propiety as being born from such dissaray; as we ultimately steared away from the heart of such conflict, or rather the position which others were fighting with me about. Their acceptence was not whole, but so did our lack of commensuration draw their swords not. 
            <br>&emsp;Where do I begin then, along this path of being me. There is much in the way of self doubt and gratuity, but so our finer sense parlays. In that, we are rewarded for our actions and the pastural continuiation of them. We are also reminded by our debts and dings, and the redeeming commission to learn.
            <br>&emsp;People's words sting, especially when we are in a state of doubt and flux. The very fact that we are uncemented, at our age, is something which emitts an ambience of disent from others. And the care of mine is to understand the progress of becoming ourself, but through constant ebbs of failing and learning, and by that refining what it means to be me, that so are there moments were, upon those slips, and on route to a new ideal, we are not. 
            <br>&emsp;In those moments our stair is perhaps a bit too glaring, as if the norms of our high self are held by a tight brace, rather than pure assembly. And generally, our oddities come to light then, as we are awkward in our austerity, and at that all to nimble in avoiding conflict. "Which, in our stiff and changing state, is all more apparent: as interactions with immaleable things is more senstive then those which easily move." It is one thing to share that you are trying this or reaching for that; and another to say that you are trying such things at all, or being in such a way that of such things, your distance from them appropraites an unfinished state. Generally I speak of this as a attitude which makes for change, and committs. 
            <br>&emsp;Theres just this apprhension by your being yourself. And being around others who you feel subject to share such things, but feel averse, makes me feel like hiding. Those who are unassuming, as in most strangers, and not your family, makes such a state unimposed. But the issue really, is not so much that you need privacy, but an admittence of who you are. For being is hard when you are not allowing your strides. And it is not too uncommon to find yourself hindered by past miscommunication.
            <br>&emsp;The heart of the matter lies in the fact that everything about me is weird. I don't use social, I don't listen to lyrical music, I don't watch the news, dramas, sports or twitch; nor do I vote, read much of fiction, comment on the videos I do watch; and at that, I hold no dualistic conception of mind or death, nor do I believe in any graphical represnetaion of culture or violence; I play games, and old ones at that, read books, and very old ones at that; I write, decently, and of myself and natural things; I sit on the floor while doing this, along with games, watching film, fiddling with my computer, and then I sleep there too; I've never had coffee or soda in any meaningfull way, nor have I had a soar throat since my reign or propiety started. I have no job, and own little regard for getting one beyond the simple wages and active kind of work; I am content with a room, walking reguarly, seeing the sun, sky and moon, hearing the birds, the wind, the rustle of trees; nor do I have any deep and or detailed reservations about children, equities or relations being commiserate with such ways. Theres simply too much difference locally and afar, for me to think that others could not agree with me and commiserate; and by my shifting hand too. In all entirety, I want and am unaverse to things uncommon, awkward, lacking custom or tradition.
            <br>&emsp;A man though, is one, in a mature sense, who holds himself to the ways in which he naturally moves and truly is. And in this commisery, the prominet note which he sings is one of understanding; where he sees, by the otherwise fear of being expliclty different, that others also are. And by that, he realizes, that the source of his quirkiness and reproach is not in the material of his ways, but his secrecy and hiding. "It is seldom the man we know who seems perverse and or dangerous, but those who are mysterious." 
            <br>&emsp;As Plato says and all wise men who've followed, 'know thyself', for the world seems clear and even, commesnurable to your case, and at that, ignorant of who you really are. Like all those with paranio, the source is in the sense that your appear shift and mysterious: but this is so, for you are a blurr to yourself, unsure, undefined, and at that, flat in motion and expression. "By which over concentration and defense accrue beneath your hidden state; or your limber around, tight, anxious, scared to speak or be seen."
            <br>&emsp;I see in this though, that one's natural gait paired with their prompt and or interest in speaking, along with the peace within oneself as to in stillness be happy, merge together to form the vector of being through the world. For one's choices marshal their way, and as a harsh aversion to crack cocaine is laudible, so are midler yet common matters derseving of equal discretion. And doing so in seemingly fair ways, can orient your paces through the world and where you go. But so, it seems, that less you conciliate with your equity, personal or of family, have the luck of chance or invested reward or have the annuities of the times, then so will you have to commesnurate yourself in a worldly way. Doing so requires communication, and be it guilded by interest or neccessity, so ought you flaunter and cooperate. For in need, so lies the latter; and in the goods of friendship and chatter, lie the latter. And for sure, having one without the other beckons the holder to bear the other's load. "If I am unfriendly, then our communcation will lack chemistry and free expression; and if I am uncoopeartive, then we will be seperated, and at that left to make ourselves anew."

            Oh meaning, how you crowd my attempts to write. For I cannot just say what things are, but what they mean.
            <br>&emsp;In that, I see that the nature of us being is one of constant repute, as the land around weighs on our otheewise personal effort; and of those who think such things are importnat, that they condem me for not attending to them especially. 
            <br>&emsp;More or less though, our being is such that in full motion, we are brimming, cheerfull, endeared to all. Lacking concrete pleasures, from sex and sugar; but doth beauty lay. 
            <br>&emsp;Besides the quality of our experience, it is neccessary for us to know the form which such motion takes. For it is not a grabbing sort of action or care, but one of managment and solidity: whereby the inputs of life far and around, speak to us, and brighten our day. "And our efforts are in keeping us intune and light as to recieve such gifts."
            <br>&emsp;I will attest to the conflict and friction which this sort of living procures; as others, by their own fear and shame or not, usher me to be more obligate to the world as opposed to ourself. In their aim, the world is what we seek, and ought we be and orient ourelves to acquire it. While my aim is to to wholesomely be, and let what the world offer itself  in the way that those whose mere eligibility (and construct) bears them to see it. 
            <br>&emsp;In this though, by development surely, lies a risk of contradiction, whereby you are yourself and accordingly tuned, but thereby seek the world, as either a  consolation for the struggles in being yourself, or to validate your otherwise personal aim --and remove any outside contempt. 
            <br>&emsp;Outside this contradiction, lies our personal path. And affirmation, or understadning at least, bears us a sort of steadyness as we go through time. For I mean to make friends, foster relationships, romance even. But I am aware that our self interest does not warrant me such things, either practically or because I am special. What I resort to thnking then, is that, in order to be myself, ought I lay within the mere sociable mean, whereby I am friendly, kind and cooperative, and not prone to fancies or expecations born of my ego and loins. From that, I can simply be, and let the world collaspue naturally. For there is no trouble in being yourself, if the communion of such thing exhibits itself sociably. But in terms of relationships, or meaningfull connection, so does expereience line an easier way, in that you learn how to usher these at all; but so do you let things happen, whereby the merrit of relations, in that their is something to bond people, comes by you being integral enough to warrant a bond between somewhat relatable. There is no merrit in saying that the way you are will not be bondable with others. For the broadest of friends comes from the broadest of relations; and I surley lack no friends, but a friendship. And by that, our commradery with folk as it pertains to our passing by or needed prescence amongst them, barrs me the neccessary sociability and cooperation; but not any need to make actual friends. Besides the activites which such pairings exhibit, I don't have much interest in those sort of things to begin with. I am more set, content and indebted to ourself. What I really care for, or am drawn to is meaningfull relationships, or deeper ones; whereby the point of relation is not from some activity, but based on who we are. To be fair, activites are varied, and thus some may bring us together in a way I'm fine with. But, to be clear, it is more about recreation which draws such interest, rather than festivities and celebration. No matter, when it comes to deeper relations, so does this come from you connecting in a meaningfull way. And no matter who you are, your not going to do this with an abundance of people. For in terms of depth, so will only a certain person pertain. I feel this is natural for all people; and my personal stake, is one of sociability amongst collegues, a more honest and at ease communication with peers --as to solidify and or expand shared interests- and a true and open fact of possibility in relations, no matter our differences. "I care little if none relate to me in terms of our non-interest in dinner. Which meaningfull relationship is sprung from such a thing anyway." And indeed, how we are on our own is one thing as remarks these ordianry things; but the point which draws others together, affords both acceptence of those things, and alterations to make such connection work. But they don't foster or deny the connection.

            Were all artists in a way, whether that be in paints, words, bravado. But there lies the prevalence of supposition, and the alternate view from inquiry. For the illustrations of craftsmen and pundants is not in itself right or wrong, but merely an expression from prior experience. I know not what that is from; and indeed credulity lies as a sort of inherent merrit.
            <br>&emsp;Where I lie though, is that whoever says this or that I care not, but of those who listen, so are they the thorns in my side. For my take on one thing, perhaps uncommon, leaves me somewhat hanging for conflict with those who see things ordianrly, or at least otherwise. And at any rate, I feel strange seeing the world so differenlty; and partciuarly, if my roots are better, or at least well staked, then the contrariety of that to someone less founded, yet perhaps in a position of authoirty or influence (relative to me or in general), leaves me fearing conflict, or a hidden sense of pirvate truth; which itself leads to a sort of condensation of purjury, 'like my beliefs were without woarrant, or unlikely to be heard'. Indeed I could speak to the rampat simplicity of all far things, and the illusroy swarm of feelings and conviction to boot. 
            <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, our reflective path can pave the way through such thicket. 
            <br>&emsp;In that, I see, that in whole, or near at least to entirety, lies the current of the world; of which we are right to oblige, and thereby earn the goods from such connection --in what is appropriate. 
            <br>&emsp;I must admiit though, that the details of such view are not well defined. For the motions of those around me are not but what seems common; and so any notion of an ideal is not in itself a guide for action, but ointment to uncertainty.
            <br>&emsp;In a truly inquistive way, we remark what is par for the course of our nature, but of the posture and pace through such lane. The idea that family, death and governance are imperatives needs no dispute; but of such things and our resolve, ought reason and honesty conjure our oblige.
            <br>&emsp;In the end, nothing matters; at least little can be attributed to the nature of particles and fields. No matter, as Hume fairly said, that be it the componetns of the matrix or the strands of a dream, that what we notice is equal to the appartus in which we judge; and by that, we take to mean that no matter the nature of things below, so are our regards (in breadth at least) born of such nature; to which we resign our deepest doubts to our own evident nature within that whole.
            <br>&emsp;In this sense, we have the peculiar concept of reflection, or awareness, in that we not only react to things via our bodie's form, but consider, determine, grow. This can be explained by the lineage of thought, and its birth from baser sensation. But removing the core nature which produces such phenomena, and listening merely to the content, which in all fairness the senses form are made of, so do we have the subjects of memory, desire, habit and fear. And perhaps, via modernity, we have literature -in impressions and expression- which let us more acutely grow.
            <br>&emsp;But so the world lay, and us, in experience and understanding around that. As we rightly take for granted the core basis of things, and at the very least act on the principles of Hume, so can we extend such station with an acceptence of our means to learn and know, and at that find suitable paths and execution. By that, our enviroment, in location and time, will determine what material we respect, and at that formulate ourselves against.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed our fear lies in the ways of the past, and the oblige we have based on a unset inquiry: for without our own application and fortuity, so does such novelty remove me from other's arrangment: which itself invites critique and abasement. But neverhtless, there is but a mere practical matter of appropriation in terms of being yourself, and not being so ill set or kept amidst people and their ways. 
            <br>&emsp;What I can see is that the world is large. And albeit it fast, durations of time hold much quantity. And holding myself to some integrity of depth, I care little for nor am I concivted towards, any person, place or thing whose quality of existence I merely suppose. "Otherwise every bug likely stepped on, would grind away at me, as if the world was melting all in its claim." To be fair though, this mark of propiety is one that affords little unintegrity, 'for our own ignornace falls prey to the shallow crys of other people, whereby we feel alone in our mystery, yet pressed by the pleas of other people; which itself makes more our own fear and worry of those subject to their concerns'. 
            <br>&emsp;If we take this concept and apply it to the fortunes of other people, and the conduct of others as well, then all that is left is our perosonal lives. By that, there is but family, and the extension of friends and relations. Foremost, there is what you already have, in guardians and siblings, and what you are more or less natured to acquire, namely whoever you are a guardian off, and another who is in the same state as you. "A partner if you will." Friends are those you find relevance towards, in that you share something in common; be it goals, interests, ideals. Whereas relationships are born from connection; in that, be it through some activity or task, you don't merely spend time together doing it, only then to return to your core life, but rather they are part of that. In the deepest sense they come with you; while those who may be mere close friends, are but part of it. But my collegue at work who I talk games with, or another who I play diablo every so often, these are but friends who I do something with. As much of a relationship as there is, so may your personal lives be exchanged; but it is a more full on relationship if they come to dinner, meet your family, hold some meaning to you in the way that they understand your truth, or engage with you while your in trouble and despair. 
            <br>&emsp;Everyone else is but a portion of our kindred spirit; in that if help was needed, I would attempt to be. But our allowence to them is merely in kindness, not interest or itinerary. 
            <br>&emsp;Assuming there is no moral obligation for you to become a docotr or fireman, nor donate and or protest for the sake of some stranger in Botswana, then your interests really have full luxury. Indeed, it is a primary fact, that your actions would follow what is layed out in the law. And by that at least, so would your actions be fair if aggressive violence or larseny were not committed. Though it is tricky to estimate the requirment for defence, when the motives by the assailents is traditionally wrong. And beyond that, if your efforts and content is concillitroy to public actions which are deemed good for the public, then your position is good. 
            <br>&emsp;There is a matter of contribution though. And per our history, any idea of right and wrong, or real commisery, came when we are about to be grown up; meaning that we had to nourishment that prime statement in our older years. Ideally, perhaps, we'd be full and grown and in the motions by the time were of a higher age. And from that, maybe we'd contriubte. Of this I cannot entirely say. For there is the matter of children, and the contribution which one's commitment to that can only afford. The right time for a child is definitiely one where that appointment is porperly met; but so may that moment be one where broader contribbutions are applicable. Let's say that youth is the primer for being, and adulthood the expression of such being. I don't see children as a starting project for adulthood, but rather something which your fully realized self takes on. "You learn grammar, write, then teach; and having children upon the completion of youth, feels like your learning to be yourself in order to then raise another: all the while, your actually being has not been." At least, the handling of another, whose nature is formed and aimed comparable to your own, does not seem like something which, in handling, you become yourself; but rather, something which earns a hand which has already become steady.
            <br>&emsp;And in that way, by the worlds need at least, ought one contribute upon materliazing themself, and in that prioritize such contribution prior to having children; or should they have children as their prime fruit of able contribution, then attend to the world in their later years? To be clear, neither needs the other to be completed. That is, I don't see rearing children to be a requisite for broader contribution; nor is attending to the world the requisite to then have children. It is one thing to learn the basics then apply yourself, but it is not strictly so, that of the aim which earns your truest abilitly --upon such application- that this should either A) be something essential, nor B) be something which preceds something else eseential.

        <div id="gritofreason">
            All of our stress comes from communication. That, and the humbling need to let go of wants from others. 
            <br>&emsp;The issue, is when there are things owed to you, or bed to you via some understanding. This creates a minimum amount of harmony required.
            <br>&emsp;And our greatest discrpency amongst friends and nearby fokl, is to the values and or conduct of family. There is no respect in me, but a reasonable obligation; whereby I listen to those close, as I would show them ore earnestness in aid. But I don't value what they say anymore than if a stranger had said it; as if anything true was so because someone you knew told it. 
            <br>&emsp;And at any rate, what we see as the course of propogration for family, and what we'd teach those ahead, is not in line with what came before. I'd say, that the general school of life has pruned those of an older sort; and squeezed out a sort of grumbled acceptence by those more recent. But our view of things is helmed by reason: for only so much of what I heard could be adhered to. And at that, as I cared little for more than what I felt, so did the futures expecation wain.
            <br>&emsp;It is an odd thing though, for our personal interests don't mean lethargy and at that privation. But in tending to priotize such things, there is not always an emphasis on the further things in life.
            <br>&emsp;To be fair though, much of my life has been charged with personal care, with the effect being one of choice. In that, our position at various time never held much more than novelty, and so we could go where chance or fortune brought us. And, as it were, the persoanl care and propiety which I sought and flourished from, held no damning limitation, particulary at home.
            <br>&emsp;For all are reared and prepped to go. But it is another thing to say there is discontent from such environment, and beyond the need to leave, they seek it. 
            <br>&emsp;For me, there were large droubts of content where I was at home, sipping off of our wider family fortune. Although there was occasional struggle, and our interest to be elsewhere gained, so was it a rather even period where I could focus on and relish myself.
            <br>&emsp;Because of this, our choices were never marshalled to any further end; nor, in times where we were independant, did we cement ourselves enough to naturally extend that way. 
            <br>&emsp;Some may forget, but often the return home is one of need or offer, in that by our novel state within a new place, so did the mere interest of being there not warrant any sense of permanency. Growth could occur, and indeed it often did. But by the whims of others and thier interest, my less than solid place was seen malleable. "Small needs of others then drew me, as neither party was reserved in changing place --in ask, or response."
            <br>&emsp;I would note then the friction of communcation during our independancy. For upon those periods of solidutde -and at home- we generally sought soemthing new and further. In this, to be fair, there were the minglings of dreams and destiny; along with the promise of change from the common mundaness and turbulence of being so close to family. While we did change in such ways, and earned much preference, there was always this sense of holding back from rushing forth. "As if some deeper plea to make the future more clear and defined came about, as the present was only clearer in being on our own. Our independance brought more certainty to the effects of our actions."  
            <br>&emsp;The trouble though, beyond ignorance, was that our fair attempt to proceed rationally, and at that contendely ahead, held a more apparent disdain from those around. Not, to be clear, in words, but our apprehension; as if our resolve within true being held the sense that others would find faults. Or, better said, that as our independance prompted us to further be ourself, that the concession to more truly and happily be, and not reach further and extend, drew embarrsement and contention from others (our sense at least). For it has never been my experienece that the ways and or good of virtue, integrity, deliberation or inquiry were either respected, praised, understood, or entirely accepted. 
            <br>&emsp;It is better to say that our being within such ways fell somewhat in line with the results that other common modes of being were measured against. And by that, some understanding and accpetence grew. But upon independance, we felt somewhat condemend for being our selves moreso. 
            <br>&emsp;One insight is that in such a course, of propiety that is, there tends to be less around which is either of interest of hospitable. And because of that, there is more reason to be yourself, and thus less involved with such things. "As if we were otherwise gasping for air, and held our breathe tigher; only though, to let go of the world around. Yet, we'd still see it, but from our point of view, as opposed to some future ahead."
            <br>&emsp;Where this has changed, is that what we see as contrary to being, is not itself so linited. Nor, is that state which we measure things agasint, based on avarice, fear or fame. In that, we see that our being has both time and place to exist and become. By that, there seems a fair lane ahead, full of different assortments of regard. Which bears much ease to the present.
        </div>
        <div id="butter&bread">
            If you would, let us talk of butter and bread. For one is the matter, the substance of your life. But this, is not so clear, for do I mean the beat of your heart, the cheer in your way; or are we speaking of the task which draws such umph, or the field  in which you glee.
            <br>&emsp;We might say, that the latter notion is remarked in terms of bread, and butter the former.
            <br>&emsp;In that way, we can speak of life in general, and ours specifically. 
            <br>&emsp;First, I must submitt that our plate is enriched with the savourisest of cream, salted finely, and kept thick and fresh. And although our loaf is not so large, so is it of the purest seed; thorough grain, ample crust, but not in a way that makes you feel thick and rough, but rather firm, crackly, malleable to a pleasent degree. Thus my life is lined.
            <br>&emsp;In general though, it is not at all an unimportant point that we'd remark upon the means to 'churning' said cream. For life, as opposed to the fortune of family, is like wind on the crust, eroding it, thinning it, making it stale and dirty. And while the latter notion remarks the dollops of bran and grain, so is it the seasoning and condiment which makes it come alive. For a tired old man is not brought to the same level of cheer in even the most wonderous ways; but those who are at peace, but firmly happy and set, see more, and at that what would not be seen in less than preferable moments.
            <br>&emsp;It is true that a lack of family, home and friends will seperate one from what is deeply desired. But so mustn't we forget, that the world is farther than this; and as we ought be a certain way as not to be whithered by its erosion, and that in sobriety and thoughtfullness ought our time with such fortunes make such a must, that beyond such dear fortunes lie the candor and hues of the world, to which we ought be equally amnple in our ways to see it.
        </div>
        <div id="asenseofshame">
            So my dependance on my parents is more cirucmstance than any thing worth contempt. I have been on my own, and in that scenario, our state and aim in life was rightly just. At least, remarks about it held no swathing disdain as per our dependance. 
            <br>&emsp;And as for our current place as such, so were we asked.
            <br>&emsp;As regards family, I see it as unneccessary, strictly that is. That, and the time and state in which you form it, is not an obvious thing either; for one could choose to do so early or later in life; and so could it be much later --considering the abiulity to adopt. And its no small point to see that in our propiety, that generoisity is already so abundant, that the concentraed peak of a child is not eseential for fulfillment. A partner is otherwise someone you have, as is the case for comrades and friends. But a child may not be neccessary in terms of the requirment in it. That, or your contribution may be more civil then private. "For one can not raise a child, deeply, and also manage a nation. At least, time, oblige and effort are required on both ends; and it seems unfair to the child especially to rear it with your hand half way in another jar."
            <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, I am in this becoming state, whereby my place in the world or role in a family is per my actual self: for that is where my efforts are given from. In that, by some fidelity to a honored spot, ought you be more than capable in your means to give. And the first rule of that is in focus, in that you don't reach for things in order to serve the moment; rather to submitt yourself to them and all they need. In the way that you'd risk your life for the child, so is it the same in your effort and time across their development, that such attention would be sacrified for that. And ought you have the means and commitment to that.
            <br>&emsp;I find the notion of possibility a dreary one, for the proper regard for it is surely undefintivitve. My words, as proper, are not always shared or welcome by others, who seek things now. Nore is my reproach from things due to our candicay being premature something which is often praised or heard. Moreso, in our general scope of life -and such regards- we may find much work to be done personally, and inline with that, interests which were drawn to from such composure. This then, is not merely a question of orientation to a common subject, but a disregard for such object for the purpose of another. 
            <br>&emsp;In that way I find myself feeling disgraceful, as if our means to family is wrong, or too little emphasized ---as family being a goal in itself. 
            <br>&emsp;It should be noted that responsibility towards what is otherwise possible, as if we should work to make something happen, is not to do with happiness,  but duty; which seems to be drawn from some broader moral principle. 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, as the economy is a different mode of the otherwise social cooperation for sustenece, so is the idea of 'family' as a crux of society a somewhat ancient notion: pre economic if you will. 
        </div>
        <div id="trulyfull">
            So the background for lifes conduct comes down to the vector of possibility, and the all to likely change, and that of the material known to us, and what we can expect.
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, we may view something as sure and defined, or otherwise admitt the natural development we go through by simply experiencing things, learning then applying. That, and the world may change, in the ease in which your desires are met, and in how simple it is to handle oppertunites --be it old or new. 
            <br>&emsp;So will fortune accrue though, be it to your aid or not. And by that, it is not unessential that we regard the econmoical risks of what may come our way. But in life, there are definite ends, and sure ones at that. Ones, which in contrast to money, require the dedication to ourselves, as to prepare and grapple with such events. Whereas money leads one to apply themselves for the sake of such means, whereby the need for purchasing has a built supply, so lies the debts of illness, injury, death and loss. 
            <br>&emsp;And indeed, the common interest in eye care and dental, along with the general and or special care in terms of medicine and first aid, are all acceptable as desired things, neccessary even. But our future need not prepare for the purchase of a boat, or a car thats more than sufficient. Nor should we plan on trips, ventures, projects and or whims, that are based on absent understanding of what the world means.
            <br>&emsp;For in that, I cannot entirely say; nor do I mean to suggest it. But we can say, generally, that being so considerate of nature and your place in it, removes one from interests which spring themselves from the absence of such thoughts. I concede to the benefit and or need for basic things beyond that of shelter and food. But not much is worth but less.
            <br>&emsp;In this way the conduct of life is a struggle to dispense. For all my personal experiences mean not, if they are not pointed towards some true end. In that lies the conflict of liberty and activism, abstract versus concrete thought, reason at the cost of lethargy and contempt. And at any rate, all we have outside such truths, is a limitless address of the things we've known so far; which we can comment on at least. For I may not know this or that, but I can at least be commiserate to the path were on, and at that be aware of the terrain and our state; for we ought see where were going, what is not had which is needed; but so may we also rest on the things we do have, and how the experience has been thus far, settling into the troubles ahead as being not but hurdles for our legs to cross, or points of trouble which require the patience and fortuity that our time has already shown to have.

        <div id="howwewere">
            My first jobs were techincially coaching and refing. The latter was stressfull, the former fufilling. My first real job was at Boston Pizza. From there I worked as a detailer, followed longer by a car washer; then as a delivery driver, sandpitt cleaner at Eagle Ridge, house painter, and a sushi maker at Save on Foods. In 2017 I left save on to work at Walmart as a produce associate; I did so for a year. I was hired for personal shopping near the end of 2019, and left October the following year. When I moved to Vancouver in 2022, I was rehired as personal shopper in August, and left early November in order to be with my Dad.
            <br>&emsp;Now, we are moving back, and surely for any and all reasons. We have too little money to move out, get hired, make an income, and bridge ourselves till the constancy of it is in place. Our mom and dad have not sold their home, and are taking on the mortage of a new one; and as it happens, including a month or two for completion, our current house may not sell till April, May or June even. It could be earlier, as Amy remarked that buyers wait to see which direction interests are going; she also mentioned that buyers may come at any time, late even. Our dad even said that the folks who wished to buy our house had some interest following their long drout of nothing. So it may sell; and surely, if we take it off before the years done, and put it back up soon into the new year, then it may sell then. 
            <br>&emsp;We are being told to work though, if only because any of our living expenses cannot be covered. The problem, is that if I get a job, accustomed and settled, then the course of doing this again is but another beginning. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, I have no modern grounds to sit on. For sure, many people succeed in the current age; but I am not convinced there happy; especially at least. 
            <br>&emsp;What I see, is that the times of old, and the ways born of them, hold no basis any more. The behaviour of people hasn't changed, only the value. But so in living, as it is fashioned to this day, so do people work for that as they would in the past. 
            <br>&emsp;And I have no immediate answer as to what I am doing different. Nor is it easy to be so forthcoming, and not get sucked into doubt, as to our current place and whether or not our prior actions were misplaced amidst the proper course of action: one, which it is not clear why the common route is not such.
            <br>&emsp;What brings it up for me is a sort of youthfull interest, and the balance of the world's need, and one's optimism that they can make their dreams come true according to that. Whereas a child who has no duty can openly see the world, youth are asked things, and at that, driven to see things in terms of duty and taste per the broader world. One, mind you, which is detailed with the tenants of family and social value. Whike a kids broad view is one of mere wonder. At least in their case, the extent of their view holds no boundires or commisioned regard; while youth, however open as per their reltaivley younger ways, has more formality and concern lined in  their vision. "Which is why children, seeing not but the stars, dream of reachinbg them; while youth think of their time and place with respect to ability, means, finance, ends."
            <br>&emsp;It might be an aid to submitt the basis of our duty and aim, which is along lines of family value. For nothing else holds so dear a spot as the basis for our kind. We may have worked together in different ways, and for different ends; but so as time and stability gained, was the constant of procreation and according relations bade. 
            <br>&emsp;With that in mind, and pairing the notion of modernity, the real question, by which our uncertainty rests, is of the manner in which our liberty should persits, with such family in mind. For on one end, there is the matter of one's natural proclivity to procreate, and the balance between electing to do so and the counterweight (of not doing so as early as possible) by those who happen to do so. In that, there is a lop sided statistic, which rightly suggests that, by our natural proclivity, that procreation will happen with either earnestness or happen chance via our natural bent. This is not an ideal, but an appeal to the populace need for procreation; and the stastical strenght in seeing this as likely by the common natures of folk -who are, and continue to be.
        </div>
        <div id="changedago">
            My roots are not so straightforward, but by whichever course, I came to see something good. 
            <br>&emsp;This came from a sense of propiety, which beyond the true beginning, had a earlier bout in similarly tough times.
            <br>&emsp;Because of this, my life has been a religous sort, in that our experience held the scale, or measure rather in which things were weighed against: whether that be as supportive, negativite, or, per the norms, relevant or not.
            <br>&emsp;That latter notion fairs the trick. For I may, in all liberty, choose to consume and practice what I please. But that I would make money, and the means for it at that, marks something a little different. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the transition between adolescence and youth was one of a idle conception, whereby the care for our experience cuold not be priortized at the abandonment of success. That is, our needs were not able to be satisfied without some sort of amends. "Literally, I sought to sleep outside."
            <br>&emsp;As it stands, I understand this now, but am also pressed by loose thinking. For our experience is all I care about. Nor are those needs and their means a damning hault. That, and our agreement to such means and the contentment to such ends, is not one which takes away from our experience. Beyond the passion which our oblige excites, and the coloring of our experience in such a dreamt way, so does the stability and space affored by our place in life, both prompt and service our experience, and at that delight it. For such occupations, however civil, are part of our experience, and at that afford us different textures and sight. Moreso, as our recent days have shown, that such a commisery, of mere stabilyt and experience, has no need or trajectory of stationlessness or promise. For we may apply ourselves, find goods beyond ourself in romance or friends; and at that, per our fuller wants, and complimentary needs --within such a life-- we can invovle ourselves in recreation or public affairs; be that churhc, free yoga, drop in sports and community involvment.
        </div>
        <div id="lastgrip">
            When I start with our experience in mind, I hukbly oblige the missing holes of our knowledge; not at all out of respect, for why would truth need any, but as a remark of what may in fact be wise for us to concern. 
            <br>&emsp;For the complexion of such experience may not define the broader structure of it; and at that, per one's intent to oblige, may our current amends be less fair in the future than they are now. As we mentioned, there was a point in 2018 where we thought that our duties were stearing us away from our experience, or piking it into the ground at least, by which we sought to ascend. But in seeing that we could not, so doth our adulthood lay. My point though, is that when we mark our experience as the aim of our regard, that so are broader interests or needs beyond the present worth addressing, as to fairly enstate ourselves within our current action. For most advice is based on the future and what your current actions are oppertune to treat -or prepare rather. And it is one thing to say that the present is fine via simplicity; but of the future and what we are more or less fine to consider, that so does the common view of the present hold an equal norm in the future. OUr present care and grasp of the present absolves according cocnerns or guidance (for some other aim); but so lingers the norms of the future.
            <br>&emsp;This creates an all mighty reservation. For less we remove ourselves from the matters central to such future, or we let such future come to be, and happily via our simple (and forseen as such) conduct, then we are left with a sort of ignorant and or defiant relation to what is ahead. Most folk, and tradition on the whole, stands from such a view, that of what is to come, that the past has already been privy to such; of which those so indetted offered their history with such.
            <br>&emsp;We could bring it together like this. Experience is a matter of quality, in that your time, be it from within, or by its relation to some task, is both sturdy and secure, but rich and tender too. As it were though, the promotion of such is not something, despite the core means, which can be mitigated entirely by such means; for as means, they need a person to exhibit them, and at that be alive; for which our needs our measured by [our ability to meet such standard and exhibit ourselves]. And the take away is that as measure is more or less based upon home and food, that so in natural and moral need, do the matters of family and community lay.
        </div>
        <div id="rumblingsaround">
            I've heard politics regarded as childish, and media as garbage; yet those some folk are curious, and at that elated at the means for knowledge.
            <br>&emsp;For starters, being unsure and holding steady within such uncertainty is much preferred then to evaluate the world on by those sources; by your own admission their poor. But in this, lies the need for reproach, as one must deliberately examine the world, through writing, inquiry and purer sources; and as such, must sit in reproach, before fuller opinions are made.
            <br>&emsp;We make for our experience though, and by that, when the words of politics and publicists are being told, and friends, family or communal sentiment is in response, so do we sit on our own examinations; by their virute, and their contrast to those scattered words.
            <br>&emsp;In this though lies some vulnerability, for seeing those frustrated, opinioned or unnerved about the world leaves an idealistic scent in air, as if it is our role to attend to such troubles, and at that not be so ignorant as to not be so. By this, I can permitt so form of generosity, be it active or in virute; one being a invovlment in such affairs, the other being a behavior of agreeableness, as to consent and assimilate to changes made for the broader good. "This will help," you hear, and you thus situate yourself to that for the common good. 
            <br>&emsp;There is a tricky aspect though, namely our rebellious mind, or that of removing hurdles and power; which differs then educating folks or protest, or that of submission; but rather evokes a sort of defiant removal, as to not merely improve, or yield to imrpovement, but to tear down those responsible. 
            <br>&emsp;I am not so agreeing to this aspect of fighting. For one, my sense of it is incomplete; while the other, is that our view of the world is an examined one; and due to the size of the world, in both time and breadth, we more often than not sit in a state of consideration, rather than approach. I admitt that this is but the present, and our idea at least of how active we should be -and in the ways we can- is progressing. But I don't much admitt the 'less than examined' -in reality or as seemd- conceptions of the world. No one is forcing us to work in camps, or removing our right to speech, assembly, guns even. All there is really, is a world whos antiquated roots has born conflict, despite the collective harmony of the broader powers. And at that, lies econony, or the vectors for people to recieve and exhibit liberty. By this, sits interest rates for mortage and loans, and the lever of taxes (for various groups). One's professional conduct is one thing, but ought our fears of this not be so condensed; nor ought we confuse a specific scenario with that of the broader world. The United States is not going to war with Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy, Africa, Australia, India or France. They could war with Russia or China; but the merrits of that which rest on specualtion, and of a far sort, seem like sparks on an otherwise dense world. Moreso, ought our fear of that, be mature when it comes to the projected loss; and unceded to ignorance as regards nuclear weaponry; as such matters merey concern more loss, or a definite point of destrcution. "But so the concern of death lay, in which a unhazy or sprawled view lets one see the actual place of conflict. Which, alotghet, is one that our own warless life is set for."

            So my time in the recent era has been one of vagrancy. At least, I resort to such when a stationary life feels to slow and small. The path in this, to be clear, is not one of much variety, as our temporary stay always amounts to staying with family. 
            <br>&emsp;I do so though with no future in mind, and their allowance. But as of late, I've felt that our taste of such vagrancy, paired mind you with our family prescence, is not either sought or ideal.
            <br>&emsp;Normally the thinking is that, if our experience is key, then removing accessory responsability will furnish our means and enjoment of that. As it were though, the limitations of doing so on our own are no longer there, nor are the concessions of being near family as permitted.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the hope of mine has been to turn our love into dreams, whereby the care to do so was furnished by some encumbent substance. "Like my fancies were made into something beyond themselves, as to support them." Besides the drama in doing so, the real issue was that, as the future was brought to mind, or the matter of our satiety, so did I clinch at the thought of being so still and stable, yet small in our experience. That is, our means were never that far, and by that, offered not much more than the mere means to be; yet such being was halted, or at least sequestered via the bounds of such means. "Like a I couldn't see or dream naturally, as our future held nothing but the mundanity of our means."
            <br>&emsp;What changed is that our idea of what experience requires, and the dissolving of outward limitations, made it so the common sway of our means was not so limiting. Not only in space, but motion, as per possibility, means of acquaintence, and normal paths for community. And because of this, our privation for the sake of experience was held with less reverence. For despite the freedom to truly be, there lacked much substance; and at that, only forced me to be even more, as to make do with less substance. "Like I were squiting my eye in order to see more around me." 
            <br>&emsp;Now, as it stands, that need to squint is no longer sought; and such a feeling is elevated by the consenting sight of stable means, which remove such need to squint, and through their lack of restrictivness; which, in itself, was something I experienced in terms of having a rich time, without so much interference from things once sought damning. By yielding to the common rungs of the world, there is immediatley more possibility. And at that, our feeling of ware upon our squint, is given room and reason to end; as there lies a suitble, promising and lively place outside dependancy.

        <div id="hopeforclarity">
            I have some loose thoughts, but some no less. Centering primarily on the balance between public and private discource. 
            <br>&emsp;As I see it, there's this (albeit fair) tendency to attribute media production as a sort of linch on the corportions and governments of the world. "Like those speaking are rallying up the citizens, who then rally to make demands; and the governmetns all sweating, tossing here and fro in order to amend."
            <br>&emsp;But our rational view does not portray this; even though our experience, in brief even, of media is otherwise concluding.
            <br>&emsp;In part, the issue lies in the orientation of our regards, whereby the press is in one sense deemed a constituent of the public, similar to the way that governments are in an administrative sense. But it is important to know, that the press is not an essential feature of a system, as the management of state affairs are seldom done in referendum or disclosure. Indeed those enacting such affairs are chosen, and by that representatives; but in lew of old comparisons, the sentiment is one of trust and the extent to which it can be given; and so much as it cannot, so lies the press' purpose.
            <br>&emsp;This is all fair and good. The issue comes in when our understanding of the state (and its features) runs short, and the seeming presence of the media becomes one of contrast to such state. As our emotions regarding the govenrment -short of virtue and patriotism- are negativie. That is, they are akin to one's care for a parent, in that they love them, but dislike them, as the sense of discipline is always on the line. While one's relationship with the media is generally positive; for they never ask, but show where your authorities are mistaken. They may even say their wrong. "As one's reprieve from their parents is not so much a dismissal and or rebuke, but frustration. In youth, one tends to rebel, namely by their developed posutre and sense." And it is a lapse of knowledge on my part which leaves the media as seeming to conjure such confidence in the public. 
            <br>&emsp;And the consequence is not one of actual disruption, but sentiment. "No matter the woes andc cries of folk, Wall Street keeps running, money keeps talking, and officials conduct their adminstrative and civil affairs." The trouble, is that as one who is both ignorant and sensible, I wish to either learn, and at that suspend my judgements until having and understanding; or I sit with the impressions of the world steadily, remarking upon their minor effects within the breadth and time of our state. But when people are complaining, or you get the sense that they are, then you feel like your 'less than critical and or indifferent' view of things is unacceptable. This is fine, and per the norm, a fair condition to have. But our ignorance acts as a hole in which our composure escapes. For instance, if there is a perceived sentiment of an officials licentiousness, then our ignornace of how officials are impactful will leave me somewhat unable to rest on the irrelevane of said persons behavior; for such grievence is not a true remark of their civil effect. Indeed there is room for such grievence, but per the points to do with such behavior. And the common effect, by me at least, is that with such an vicious stain, that such offical is seen as incapable, or better yet an antagonist within their civil action. And I, having some sense, know that the behaviour in question does not mean, in all likelihood, or in relevance, that their civil efficacy is off. A matter of ethics sure; but that the both would and could turn the lever is not essentially diminished by their licentiousness. If I don't know about such civil action though, generally I'd say, then I have a hard time resting on such notion. For, in all fairness, I seldom feel so anarchic or afraid as public sentiment can seem. But in appearing so, I am only more pushed to be steady in our own sensible view. Indeed our life can procurre such indifference by its own motions and 'ingestion' of media. But so much as I do view it, and have this farce reaction, so do our definitions lie. And if they are empty or loose, then I am left standing with the sense that nothing is wrong, but not then able to say why things are all right. "The public is afraid, or acting against some malignancy which I do not see. But I do not knwo what there is otherwise. As if someone said that God created the world, and that such a claim was so by neccessity; and I may say sure, in admittence, but that such a claim was empty. Or better yet, that I did not align with such view naturally, but had no other which I did. "  Such struggle we'd define and say, is about a subjection to falsity, or claims at least which are not whole, principled (and at that from inquiry, and thus suggestive), but then not having something of your own which is defined. For you end up refuting such claims on their baseless, rather than denying them on some truer measure. 
            <br>&emsp;In that though, lies one who heeds no rush to finish their quilt; or at that lacks any taste or happiness for their effort. But when someone comes in and rattles the piece so far, it fairs both petty grievence and more serious aversion as to the welcomenedness of rough action upon a working piece.

        <div id="balanceofold">
            When I was younger, I cared most about being myself. Being so young, I had no alternative sense. But, compared to fire, scenarios which seemed to draw me out of that state were more or less hot, and an aversion. 
            <br>&emsp;When I got older, circumstances came about whereby we'd recieve the means to further ourselves, and I'd say no. And upon reflection, a core reason was that, without indisputable amounts of cash, that your realization of those ways would fall short; we saw awkwardness in the scenario, and a fairly reproached place from our parents serving us in that full way. For if we worked to make this form of life happened, then I would be alright and unembarressed. But as it were, when I was young even, the means for me to do so were not there or apparent; and having to ask our mom and dad felt like gathering lingering sticks to make a fire; the flame of which, by that method, felt unstable. And from that doubt, led to a fear of change, as if I would become someone different, but in a state of want of such things. 
            <br>&emsp;Instead, I choose to do nothing, and remain by myself. I never lacked friends and ability; but so as they amended themsevles for women and fun, I was  left alone. Better yet, I transitioned into caring for those things primarily, but was in a rather minnowed state in terms of means. I became a sort of tag along, hitching off of other peoples car and booze.
            <br>&emsp;As I got older though, this way of living led to despair. I recall one point where I was fully working, and had unparamount means to splurge; and doing so truly felt rewarding. But as that situation eroded, and our means became smaller and challenging, so did I care little but for a indulgence which was binge worthy. Prior, we'd drive around, have fun and be a light. While in this, I wished only to be alone, or a mile away from a party, and consume things for satiety rather than fun.
            <br>&emsp;The balance seemed to be the thing which was off. For our full amends brought with it a sort of confidence; the opposite of which brought embarassment and doubt, as if I merely thought of fun, but relied on others to provide it for me.
            <br>&emsp;This is one end of things. And indeed, our full time at work and the full means of fun around it, marked what is the otherwise path of teenage fufillment. And by that, what I failed to reach the years prior. But as the work slipped, so did the fun; and by that, what we sought changed to. We became private in our interests; and despite the substance remaining, our care for it became less outward and exuberent, but personal, in the way I cared about games and noraml food. "Smoking weed became a sort of inhaler, of which I had no interest in doing it in some elaborate way; and even though this would occure, as smoking was so desired, I much preferred to be in a comfier sitatution while doing it."
            <br>&emsp;For whichever reason, this mode of life did not continue. Namely because the use of weed was depleting, and our shorter means around were noticbly small. When I went to college though, I found that or aim of it was bare. And despite enjoying the tasks, the purpose of them was empty. And so the reality of applying ourself had so little to contirubte, beyond our natural interest, that we became depressed; as it was like wishing to leave a post, in intent at least -for I did not mind showing up. 
            <br>&emsp;Following this, we were exposed to the brevity of nutrition, noticing through some article that mussels had 12000% vitamin B12, and Kale with 1000% vitamin K. Me and my friend were so intrigued, as if a sort of richness was in front of us. Unfortunatley though, despite gaining much personally, we focused so much on turning such interests into something profitable. Only, our care for such things lied so deep and at hand, that the seperation from the outer world which spurred us to see such things, held no place for us to bring such things into fruition. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the desire to be in that outer world is one best characterized by security and fun, and unweildingly as not to be impassioned but elated -like were seeking more than ingrained. But as said, we were not in such lands, or much in line with them. Being was not clear or easy otherwise, which was why, as is sometimes portrayed in peoples conversion to religion, that doing things central to ourselves was itself a sort of application. In a similar way, upon breaking up with our girlfriend and loosing friends, we stirnly applied ourselves to schooling, and took up a consistent workout regime. And of note, when we ended up changing schools and finding more friends, our outwardly place became more secure, and our personal interest wained.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, we did not create that buisness, as we only had excitment for such things, but held no definite means or care to bring them beyond ourselves. The point I'm getting at, is that our wish to do so was one akin to being offered money, and the elation which comes with that. In getting older, I can see that a steady and secure place within yourself removes the otherwise outward interest, or sensitivity rather, by which forward or deep means to such fruition are attached to.

            So I have some lust, and perhaps rightly so. I see craiglist personals, eharmony like sites, POF like sites, and other things of the sort. At the very least we can pursue something, or be invovled, and at that, have some sort of priority beyond ourself; which I believe will help in being more discrete at work and recreation.
            <br>&emsp;This pleausre though is consuming, and I see nothing else. And oddly, besides our experience, I cannot quite explain why this is not the soul aim. For the reason to do it is paramount, like warmth in the cold. 
            <br>&emsp;Yet our days have only shown, by neccessity maybe, how being steady within yourself is not only satisfying, but reassuring to any of the desires who abscence sprung us to be more self content; and, we are quite fufilled with such development, for nothing feels better than working on yourself. That, and we don't feel idle so long as we have this aim; for there is never so much you can do, nor any time to stop it. 
            <br>&emsp;But the true promise of this is liberty. For one who needs the world will not have much luck less fortune bears the way. And even if they held the kingdom's crown, so would it not feel enough. While Cretes walked around happily in a theadborn robe; or Socrates, who responding to Melinulus' claim that Athens was expensive, showed him that barley was a minced amount compared to the olives and wine which he sought, and at that measured expenses by.
            <br>&emsp;In all manners, the fruit of glory, gluttons and loins, is but a inflammed moment, heated, somewhat impassioned; but the moment goes like each point of a stream; leading one to become somewhat disposed, and angled towards another moment. While self regard and content, by it's own merrit, seeps one into a state of rest and tranquility; something of which is, in practice, lost only by contrary efforts or a lapse of producing ones; nor do the effects of such balanace loose their appeal upon use, both in reliability of the means, and their saturation. "For as I paint my pallete with sweets and wine, so does the same taste mundane. While the crsip feeling of a steady morn, looses none of its endearment or appeal; nor do the means to such freshness loose their stature as being so productive, and at that value and appointment."
            <br>&emsp;All in all, liberty is our claim from being propietous. For the world may grant fortune; but not even death is excluded from the emperor's call. And at that, I am not sure what remarks we have about wishes and ends that don't fall beneath that? 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, liberty is what occurs when one is free enough to live well; in that, the latter notion marks a cease of hostility; while the former marks a sentiment of fertility and faciliation. For none, in the freest state, can inherently paint, or reconigze the details of wonder; or at that, find a sort of peace and steadyness found by right actions. For the matters which give them leave to such pursuit, do not imbide them with the qualities they seek. As a removal of famine, and at that an offer of plentiful food, does not inscribe the proper use of that. Being fed versus not is a matter of freedom, for the brightest star could not pull you away from starvation. But upon satiety, or the ability to do so, the actual amends for liberty, or reasonable goods, come to pass. For it is not only a state which needs moderation; in that food was on offer and you needed to select 'wholer' kinds. For even if whole kinds were all that was available, this still would neither A) account for other choices which held moderate means, and B) actions which were not only good because they were not something altenrativley bad, but actual productive. In that way, positive amends are what liberty feeds off of. For in despair, one cannot even survive; and are at best lucky to breathe. But upon such breathe, they may attempt to overcumb such need. Upon doing so though, beyond being free, there are accomodations within the matters of such need --such as keeping to foods rather than indulgent ones-- along with efforts which produce the stations for richer goods. As painting is not embellished by a mere steady hand, but a practiced one. Even the sights which spurr you to the page, can be seen in a finer light. For one's interest in representing death, no matter the heart, no matter the trade, still require an understanding of what it is; at least, in their attempt to further see it through their craft, ought they reflect on the parts they already know. "For there is surely some characterizing feature which makes it distinct from life: but in that, ought one delicately know." 
            <br>&emsp;In that, one in need cares not for the goods of consumption or liberty, but the filling of their stomach. Upon such satiety, they may be prepped for richer kinds of satiety, and at that, the exhibition of wants which spiral off from the deeper needs.  But in the land of reason, lies a fuller kind of being, namely that of expression and receptivity. For the vanity of consumption is not all to hard to detail; but we can say, in comparison, that it is not so delightful by the abscent terms which expression and receptivity offer. In those, your in motion like consumption; only one is falling over, seeing only what is exciting their passion, and more than not likely unable to be much more upon completion. While the other is light and tender; and albeit not so heated and alloyed, so is the initial step one of dear fancy, rising up to a fairer mark in terms of substance, but like the ends of a storm still winding away. The fruits of our loin  come to pass, leaving us to seek more; while one in the purer kinds of motion, be it of dance, words or craft, tend to remain so, ably and happily. Moreover, the dearest part of this, for those at least who have lust the youtfull means or interest in such lust, is that through and upon such tender attentions, one is treated to the all mighty posture of rest; whereby the effect is not one of past pleasure and more to come, but a satsifcation which lets one peacefully be: as if they'd truly one. For in that, the tips and tats of our writing and craft pitter along, picking up to their own fuller strides; but so in our heart and mind do we settle, gently, but whole and solidly too. And be it the cooling wind, or the heat of a summer day, so does the fuller grooves of your craft wear little upon a lack of means or time; for the strides prior have given you the strenght from what you'd already done. "While those moves to cheese, sex, fame and wine, care only for more; or worse, sit uneasily if there's none."
        </div>
        <div id="strenghtfornot">
            In all fairness, meeting your lusting needs is no small task. If it were so simple, then the comparison between expression and receptivity would be one of quality; at least qualities of taste and consistency, over accesibility.
            <br>&emsp;But the truth of the matter is that having sex, eating rich food, purchasing wonderful things, is no small cost. Or, better yet, that compared to expression, which bears satiety in even failed attempts, the route to such consumptions are not so definite; rather you must try and chase, and deal with the unease until such excess.
            <br>&emsp;For I see that consumption is like a splinter, throbbing till its dislodged. And in that way, I say nothing ill of sex or food, but gluttony, distaste for whole things, and horniness. For these things cloud your mind and spirit, rustling you till their goal is finished. And indeed there is room for excitment, along with pleasure, but it ought not thwart the rest of your life.
            <br>&emsp;The reality though is that sex is hard to come by. At least, in our younger years, we were somewhat embarrassed by the natural means we had, and not those which bore sparkle to your attraction. In many ways I saw the means to such sparkle as futile and dumb; and thus we steared away from their ends completely. In good sense, the right statement is one that says, by your natural goods, that you offer them without comparative pretense and shame, or at that, exagerated needs which such 'pretenses' are based on. "For the vain idea of beauty, in hotness namely, does expect more than those natural needs. Yet all people have beauty, and at that, hold room for attracion. And the relations born of this need less than those grandeur displays."
            <br>&emsp;Indeed our life can be summed up by a balance of cynic complacency, fair reprieve from superflous and taughty showmanship, along with a sort of crushed despair between the ultimate bounds of which our 'hot interests' were moderated by, and the otherwise expression of that range of cynicism into the dislike and disinterest in working for such consumptions, but in a moderate lane. 
            <br>&emsp;For our mom and dad never let the future and our current prepeartive duties slip away. And by that, all I saw was a life employed towards that. And such a life was not one I yearned for. And so, the youthfull efforts which would serve my hotter interests, were not embellished due to our sense of duty being reproached from; as such a sense was marshalled agasint the broader parts of our life: and our swerve from those saw me swerve from those which were more novel and fruitfully fun.
        </div>
        <div id="whitheredconsumption">
            Coming from this is an over reliance on liberal goods. For our aversion to the norms, and at that an unremarkable attempt for consumption, meant that, in purpose and satisfaction, that the goods of reason were emphatically there. 
            <br>&emsp;The value of this is hard to explain. As the terms used ultimately remark feelings that are not themselves easily expressed. That, or as clear as they are, the sentiment is not compelling. For the pleasure of sex, or comfort of food, is something we know and can relate to. While the solidity one feels while writing inquiries, playing games, relishing shows and film, is not something which holds much insight to the feeling involved. We understand what a good film is, and why thats enjoyable; as are creative efforts somewhat clear in their delight. But these two fall short of any real insight; as we are simply comparing our own time watching a movie, and relating that to the supposed feeling another had while they watched one. And whereas the taste of food and hottness of sex is something that, as an experience, is understood, or at least grapsed as something desired within the activity of food and sex, the actual feeling of watching a movie and things of the sort is not equally understood. Despite our grasp on the activity. 
            <br>&emsp;Foremost do I say this, for the feeling in question is not so universal. As one may be flipping through channels, unervingly unable to rest and enjoy, while another is hooked, satiated by the beginning of the episode, and elated by its finish; and then unable to wait for following previews. These are different experiences within the realm of televsion. And at that, one watching the same show as another may have a different experience. For you may have seen something before, and have sort of interest or respect for the material in play. And by that, like a performance seen before, or better yet, like a roller coaster you've been on previoulsy, 'throw up your hands, this is the best part!'.
            <br>&emsp;The passions of consumption are in themselves consuming. For the roaring embers of your loins cloud all other cares and judgement; and at that, hover around for anything which can please your excitment. But age and duty lessen the proclivity for such flames. And at that, offer the experiences of pleasure, but not their inflammed excitment. And from that, beyond the satisfaction such pleasure brings, lies around the rest of your time and ways. The points at which, must be filled for living to be claimed.
            <br>&emsp;My life was such, that that proclivity for excitment was not abily or happily enacted. And so we fondled around, privatley contenting ourself, or mopely despairing over the lack of goods our excitement sought. And indeed from this came much envy towards those seemingly endowed with such affairs. 
            <br>&emsp;It would not be unfair though, that our amends in those days was towards the unmitigating task of school, and its day to day and long term needs. Considering this was our chore, I only wanted free time and comfort with respect to it. And getting girls, partying, things of sort, only came from a job; at least extending yourself into such realm. But doing so brought me outside of the harmony I had with school. In that I would go, do my work sufficiently, then retreat to my points of comfort. Indeed, had I a definite and or extended view of such schooling, than perhaps the goods for that would lead into those loinfull goods. Better yet, considering the merrit of school, and this aversion to abandoning that for the sake of composure needed to have fun elsewhere, that applying myself more for school, and at that gaining composure from that, would more than likely led to those funner goods, but sourced from that composure born of more merritbale extension. 
            <br>&emsp;I never did this though. And besides the factors which led that way, and paired mind you with the mindset which understandibly came from such influences, so did our youth lay, in that we did not embellish our oblige to school in any capacity beyond the point of sufficiency. "As if to make it seem, and at that validate ourselves, by the most minimal stake." But this did not lead to much more than an enormous vista of oblige upon graduation; for we were then asked, and at that personally placed, to do something with ourselves. As if the point of school had been reached, and set us off to the subsquent chapter. But I had barely finished the book; at least I had skimmed through enough to get through school. But upon the next book, our ability and care to read was so minimal, that the tasked seemed a burden. Especially because, in that large oblige, lied no real desire or end from me. And although this describes all yet too little, It can say that our prep in life failed, upon which our motions through the stalemate which followed led to the interest and care for the lane which were still part of. 
        </div>
        <div id="rockyflair">
            I feel fair in remarking the motions of liberal goods and consumption, as being fit for analysis through the measure of elation, and how the swerviness of such is no good thing to have; and at that, prone to misinterpration in the way that 'the excess' portion (or upswing) is used as a opponent to the otherwise steadyness of liberty; but in that lies confusion regarding the starting point of such excessity, whereby one goes from a plausible equal point as one whose temper is otherwise calm; and in that case, the high from that standard is not so redeeming, in particular when you consider the actual form of such swing (in terms of quality and width), and the more simple notion of 'the downswing', the result of which is often an upheavel back to the standard; which too, holds its own shape and hue. 
            <br>&emsp;In such sense, the flairs of elation, both up and down, are not so desired when you consider the wholesome plunder within a virtuous state, and at that the bitter taste of the downswing and upheavel. 
            <br>&emsp;I have worked through a near arm and a leg to describe such sentiments in my life. For support is an all to forgotten privalge; in the sense that nature is out to get us, and we hold so much which is worth feeling dear about when it comes to our family and friends who stand by us through our response. But that we would live per those descriptions, marks the fact that our life has peered away from what is normal, and at that prone to the wholest of supports. As it were, our time has been such, that our care for virtue has come from a sort of parched resolve, in that the goods of elation were a farce to me. But absent of virtue as well, we were left with an experience which was all worthy of contempt. Only, our cultivation of virtue, as if a commisery to ends worthy of what we were otherwise averse too (in elation), brought with it a fully integral lane for us; which itself, albeit unpitiful, still lacked the acceptence that our elated success would receive.
            <br>&emsp;Now I stand with much understanding, having ruled the cynic and beggar in me; as not to fold under the lack of support amidst the world, or begrieve those who offer at best their neutral hand. "Who are never elated themselves for our prowess in virtue; merely accepting, and at that ready shame me upon the slightest slip beneath our proclaimed status." But in that lies that the true course of our way, that through the bare embrace to virtue, and our albeit fair yet, in better terms, humble naivety, clambered the currents of care and amends. For in that, ran a dear friendship, between man and himself, through which the world was seen. 
            <br>&emsp;And all our 'descriptions' serve, is a ledger of reasons and defense as to why said stream ought continue flowing. Only, in heartfull matter I know, merrily, that being is all I need. 
            <br>&emsp;"And the lie in life, is that solutions to your problem are in fact the proper course for action; for in my accounts, they are but bracings to the apprhensions born of not being; the strides of which need no candor or stake."

        <div id="localabide">
            I submitt to all that I have no morals. In whole, I have our own mere interests, and nothing else worth commends.
            <br>&emsp;Our sympathy is not barren though, merely our contribution. 
            <br>&emsp;In that, I simply attend to our common matters, namely of virtue, family and friends. 
            <br>&emsp;Where I am no maligned is in our placement within an illustrious world, which holds neither detail in time, nor breadth within the integrity of it. This is the commercialized view, the picterqsue one. And this I do no oblige, for it marks no the bits of world strung together into earth, mammal and man, but rather the theory, tale and practice of it all.
            <br>&emsp;I am a cynic, and by that fair deficit, admitt only to our curmudgen acceptence of those who critique such matters; and be it with respect or passivity, so do I accept. But  of those who blundgeon me with my lack of knowledge or amends in a current world, but not a substantial one, to that wince not at our ill-commission.
            <br>&emsp;Nucleaur weapons may be used, so be it; as may floodings, typhoons and droughts increasingly occur, so be it; as is crime similarly postered, so be it. This is for the governments of the world to align, and at that the citizens to accept the prospective change. Education is fair, as fair accounts of those who say one thing and mean otherwise; but we ought not pretend like we are anything but what we are, be it the chief executive, secretary of finance, civil employee or resident of the state. "Let virtue breathe commradery, and at that open mindedness to the routes by which we exhibit resourcefullness; and at that, an equal receptivity to other's proposed problems."
            <br>&emsp;It is said that philosophy, as in all guidance, is aimed at one thing only: to fear not the future, and in all practicality, accept and bestow the ways into death, and at that senility. But so in our common fears, whereby we fret at the commerce of states, or the flamboyance of corporate officials, does the source of our discontent lie in sympathy. For I truly care not what the government gives and takes from me; for by all accounts, my life is fostered by employment and oppertunity. What really irks me, is seeing others in despair, or subject to violence during conflict; these sightings breathe a fury in me, 'and purge me towards the state culprit'. 
            <br>&emsp;But so in fear of death and the soul gain of wisdom in guiding us through it, that so in our sympathies to other people, and at that the empathy within that as our similar perrils compare, do we need an equal kind of guidance, or wisdom rather, as to be less elated in our fears and struggle; on par with the sentiments which wisdom produces in order to level out our fears and bearing of death.
            <br>&emsp;I know not the pain of severe injury, nor the taste of dust as I sleep woefully on the floor. "My own floor is covered with rugs and linens." I can say though, that our sympathy's sprout as our own struggle ceases. And by that, lies a kindred side to the sense which offers peace through death, whereby the sense of propiety and neccessity spurr an equal economic, and by that worldy grace. 
            <br>&emsp;In that though, per our current place, lies one who is endeared to all, if not for a generous angst. For despite our lack of struggle, and a tender sense of the goods I seek, purely, so do I lack much composure when our sympathy for others is flared up. More than that, we are not in any real sense contributing; which offers no grip on the matter. 
            <br>&emsp;What I can say though, that as erotic images flair our libedo, and at that elate what is otherwise a calmer and contendted passion, that so in the media lies a unfettered source as to elate your fear for the sake of others; and at that, the irritation at others causing it.
            <br>&emsp;And in all ignornace your justness and integrity may lack; but from an understanding which is proportioned and substantiate. "We mustn't measure towns with mile long sticks, for the units become small; nor can the world be represented in anything but miles; yet what I see is a limit to that broader extent, with smaller and fainter measures added onto it, but in no way enough to be circumspect." 
            <br>&emsp;I struggle then, in that of the worlds enormity, my sympthaties are clouded out, for in no fair way can I deeply see. Yet I am somewhat on par with the pace of things, in all there might, and merely keeping along; all the while things occur naturally, and we coalesque with our natural increase of attention and care. Yet when we read or here dramtic statements, we are thrown a little, as if the problem which the world presented was in fact near and clear. I struggle though in seeing this, if only because our sense is otherwise when we are not in view of a small world. For in our greater studies, I keenly compared our sights and senses which are wholesome and appropriate, and those which are righteous, naieve and condensed. 
        </div>
        <div id="farhappenings">
            We have our truth, and the exploration of it through inquiry. And indeed my desire lies in that course.
            <br>&emsp;But via our sympathies, we somewhat hanker over it, and at that run ourselves over. Indeed our sympathy and or fear is exasterbated by our consumptions and state, but there the question lays: why are we so drawn to our sympathies, or moved by them rather. 
            <br>&emsp;It may be true that what we mean by sympathy is like a stomach ache a 1000 miles away, and we, in line with our own aches and being, trust and or accept them as being per their own place. We are all on the same stream, but each of us our rowing, and less someone is drowning besides you, those far around hold no means or need of oblige. "Indeed our parched sense of those around such people makes it seem like their perrils are unbounded by support, and antagonism at that."
            <br>&emsp;In other words, we have the truth, a path to it in the way that a garden is but a blossoming place, yet the value of this is unclear. Again, I feel it comes from our sympahty, whereby the self regard which empathy affords, wherein you share someone's struggle, but thereby hold warrant to priortize yourself, ceases. At that point, you are, by all abscences, free and liberal. 
            <br>&emsp;The truth though, is that we are somewhat sensible to the worlds despair, in the way that we concern ourselves not with every death, in animal or man. Nor we do account for all accidents, injuries, payments and frustrations. Even a rampant genocide is hard to express; for our efforts feel at best communicative, rather than adversarial. It seems right that our understanding sympathizes with those who are misfortuned amidst natures growing ways, all the while knowing that it is from such growth that the misfortune occurs. And from that, our attiude, contributively, is never gripped by financial aid, as the tempests of the situation are at best dulled. Minorly even; though there is merrit in the means for repair. But we somewhat sit here complacent, resting on the reality which produced this, by which, compartively, we accept like a natural disaster -whereby we hold no blame. Nor does this foreign sense, by which through natures flow we trust (is the cause), do we see the actual misfortune any other way; for in that we equally trust, that there is real, as opposed to illustrious struggle.
            <br>&emsp;In that sense I am wrong. For my mother and father, gautning over the news, pronged in their worldly sense, hold a reaction which is in fact fair. As for the reason, I cannot entirely say. And per our dissedence to such cause, so am I, as in all shortcomings of perfection, understandibly unoritented to such reason, due to our 'less than pronged' impression.
            <br>&emsp;There though lies the care for truth, as it lets me comfortably and suitably be. Perhaps it is it's own prompt for inquiry, of our contribution. For I may be best and right to join military operations, to volunteer in Africa, teach ESL, or something more community based and local.
        </div>
        <div id="mineandother">
            I might, with literary indulgence, spread our tenants of experience. In a four quadrant view let's say.
            <br>&emsp;For one, there lies joy; along with the marshalling of it. Then there is struggle, meaning our imperative deed to nature. "For not I or any man alike can fake a grasping breathe without airs prescence." Then their is trauma, or better put, the hues of the world; which might be better defined as the contents of the furthest conception. And then, nicely, lies rest; whereby we see no misfortue or foreign grievence.
            <br>&emsp;This latter comes quite easily; but it requires a mixture of integral relief from understanding the world, and at that properly stating it's trauma, and at that plea for you to contribute -or sympathize. But alongside this, sits the mob, or common sentiments, and how these, in the push to solitude and or (fair) dependence, causes a grinding friction between you and that 'percieved pedantry and elation'. 
            <br>&emsp;Aside that balance of peace and true sentiment, lies the mirror of joy and struggle. For in one, you are burdened, and at that stripped away. While the other, you have the treats of life for your attention, and at that the self interest to remark upon such travels. "As if I know where I am going, within my freedom and her aim towards such good." Sometimes though, when the balance of sympathy is high, and our peace is more latched onto rather than situtated upon, then our joy feels more novel, and at that a glimmering promise; and by that, despite the sparks of hope which our moment of peace affords, so deep down lies our honest conset to the tears and thicket below. 
            <br>&emsp;And perhaps virtues greatest claim is the blossoming  from wise integrity; whereby those brambles are tended, the esscence of such being ethics; and by that, our means to remove ignorance and naievity is equal to our means to explore our dearest treats; all mind you, by the proportioned relation to the world, whereby said removal of bare mindedness raises you above the otherwise small minded frustration with things, and at that the pin on your own peace: the description of which, can best be stated as a formative stance through the world, by which our sight is on all things, and at that prudent for your own deeds, and the sympathy of others. For the proportion of that regard leads your attention to actions which are suited within a completely viewed world. "And your own propiety, family, relationships, peers, collegues, neighbours and the kindred interaction with community and humanity at large, bears you a fairer state."
            <br>&emsp;And the ethics of your own nature left bare, leave you vulnerable to the impressions of the world; the broader definition of which elevates the sharp and bitter tastes, but no less drenches your stiff pallete. 
            <br>&emsp;Where I stand then, is why we need definition, which is to say to freshen our views with timely sense and accuracy, and not propitiate our receptive instrument. And the anwser truly comes down to morals; particularly those with earthy as ooposed to local remarks. For in that, you more than likely would attend, as would you with ease to your family. But man is always growing, and contacting other locales. And our moral quandery lies in the mystery of those amends; whereby the boundries are removed between us.
            <br>&emsp;The point being, that you cannnot be entirely perfect so long as the fortune of others has any sort of concern. The nature of said misfortune, and the appropriate response is one thing; and indeed, defintiion removes the risk of error and at that gratuitous sympathy. But so are we somewhat left hollowed and bare, when we are so uninvolved or committed to those around me. It is perhaps are peak towards modernity that has me looking beyond our local borders; but in all our balancing lies therein the farthest end; whereby we act not like people of old, whose idea of success was the triumph of their own folk, even at the expense of others; but for all of mankind. 
            <br>&emsp;For morals can be split into two camps, namely those which are obligate to fighting, as to achieve the ends of duty through opposition; and those which are boundless, or of all people, and beings at that; by which our opposition is to nature; at least that is the mold for our task. "And indeed, it is much easier to accept, holding all of eachothers hands, her task, whereby we all take her hand; rather than taking some of ours in order to break down others." This may be the better path truly. But of its interest, or aim rather, I am not sure what it is beyond the satiety of its people. And nature surely holds no short supply for us all. 
            <br>&emsp;I'd describe then a 'national' sense of unity, as a head down approach; as if such unity is in arms, and at that against others united. But the spoils of that seem somewhat ignored, in terms of the need for such opposition. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps I have a conceived interest, whereby natures truest task, in terms of our liberty and end, is such that, all people being proportioned towards that, removes any stragglers for goods sought in opposition: namely food and shelter. The issue though, is that the truth of that human matter is not but of inquiry. And so the reproach from a life whose gain is measured without appropriation to what the contents of such pursuit would be if they were respective of the bearing of such inquiry, is one thats uneasy to sell.
        </div>
        <div id="goodlineage">
            I see with some strenght, that our appeal in life is to goods born of virute; and that such state is born of aversion to impropiety, and a disposition to its opposite; the motivation of which is born from the stability it offers, and the flourishing which steadily and congenially spurrs.
            <br>&emsp;Yet, in all opposition, lies a sort of farce. Not so much of those pressing me; for which my family plays the part. Rather, in our awareness of the truth, shortcomings reveal themselves to others, in that our actions correspond only to what we know; and even in foregin lands, less we abandon relations with such sources, so are we left with a trembling to their expectations: as we have nothing positive. 
            <br>&emsp;Central to this are paternal values. As friendly and or romantic relations are like long summers; lucky to have come, but with no damantion upon winters coming. 
            <br>&emsp;Rather, children situtate themselves as the soul concern; in society, from our mother and father, and at that the judgement of others around, commending and or disputing me for my actions as they proper to such oblige.
            <br>&emsp;To begin, beyond traditin and what other people expect, there is no duty in having children. The government does not request; nor are you censored in rights or oppertunity. You are at best subject to scrutiny, pity or indifferent dissapproval by folks familiar with the matter. "And indeed, modernity has brought with it a decrease in the passions of such contempt; nor has the expectation of such afairs remained a custom."
            <br>&emsp;But, we are all people. And as friendship and romance are to be expected, akin to one's sensible course amidst the comfort of food, so is it fair to expect, or predict rather, that children will be sought, and by that sentiment, had.
            <br>&emsp;This is comparable to a kids eventual interest in a car; and despite not requiring it, so would the value and or interest predicted to come, be tailored with the approval of actions set one for such achievment. Children are no different, in that the foresight of their coming, per an assumed interest, elevates actions as worthy of approval --or not- in succeeding in such action.
            <br>&emsp;For all contention and praise in the matter comes down to the requisites for parenthood; in that you must birth, shelter, feed and raise the kid. And of the needs which one's expereicne, or common sentiment (as inhereted) have shown to be useful and or essential in meeting such matters, so doth wisdom lay. 
            <br>&emsp;For all men generally wish well for another. At least, of the concerns men have, it is usually within the sphere of those which they'd deem kindred. And by that, as tenants for certain tasks are inhereted, so does such guidance get passed along. And so a young man will be prompted by their families guidance, via the assumption they have that he has certain interests, and their experience in what is effective for the matter; the union being one of parent's care for him to succeed, and thus offering him what they can that they esteem useful. 
            <br>&emsp;And indeed, as a young man myself, I find that, misguided or not, that the interests of such sentiment are such that it is rarely of little benefit to at least heed such input. For even if those who care for you are fools, you can at least expect that their intent is good. By that, I submitt myself to their words in order to listen to something worth my time. Which is not how most discourse is occasioned, in that, less I beleive there will be worth, then I afford no attention. Whereas to those who I care for, and at that see as caring for me, I bear such attention without pretense of profit. There may be none, and at that, I continue to see them as I had. But their relation to me bears them a constant welcome to try and suggest something. 
            <br>&emsp;Where lifes friction comes to fight, is not neccessarily when said offerings are of no benefit; rather when said inputs are not given with our own welcome to take them or not. But instead, there is a mixture of indigence at our not accepting what is said. That, and of the ways we are presumed to take otherwise, there is a sentiment of pity and disgrace; as if, what was offered confidently as something good for me, upon not being adhered to, colors me with actions that are then not good; which invites the sense that we are thus not doing well, despite the esteemable offer.
            <br>&emsp;The cause of this entanglement is not one that has much basis in the relation; for in that, there would be one if I bore no attention. But seeing as I do, and the concern is one of accpeting such offer, that the reason I do not, is comparable to the reason that the dissent from the offer bears conflict: namely, that those offering such sense, beleive it to be true. 
            <br>&emsp;And to halt our inquiry, I'll simply say, that as for the lineage of one's belief, and the crossover between folk, be it strangers or relatives, that such matters are set in the means by which knowledge is acquired at all. "And the according relations which exhibit themselves based on such material." But aside from that, lies the matters of our believe. Beyond our disputes with others who see otherwise, there is, by our character and right, a bound of liberty to both enjoy and heed such beliefs, and at that their steps and ends.
            <br>&emsp;In that, lies our core principle, which is that a child is something you attent to, and oblige yourself to its helpless need. Romance is a matter of interest; and despite the loss, both parties continue to be. While the loss of a parent by a child is a damning sentence. For despite their comparble trouble in remaining happy, they also cannot feed themselves. If it were the old times, then their inability to gather food would be a complete sentence. Nor in modernity, where employment is concerned, would their lack of so warrant them any stock of food -or shelter. And so bar none, our regard for a child should be a moral one, rather than a fancy. 
            <br>&emsp;And it being so, is a challenge, as I know not how our own life should be. But, considering morals to be defined along the lines of duty, we can at least be imperfect in out attempt to be responsabile. While the whims guided by fancy seem more like dreams and passion; and albeit fair and pleasurable, are not themselves productive, but rather gains. "In other words, one's regard for children is comparable to all regards, in that their are means and ends. But whereas the failure of a relationship is but a cease of the end, so is a failure of parenting a failure of another's being. And by that, we can say, that easy or not, that the duty to a child is of the highest order; and by all fair accounts, ought not be 'handled' with impairment, nor oversight to things we'd thus be ignorant of." 
            <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst this, is that the measure by which we happily and neccessarily raise our child by, ought be whole and complete; and by that, not garnered by convention or approval, but by the measure. To be clear, this is not to say, that if our principle for rearing is to have our kid be well, that our particular case of something be decided by that; as such a statement is not actionable. Rather, we ought have some sense as to what we need, in terms of home, food, prospects. For the ends of our child will be such, that by their own whims, and furnished in their own manner, that such elements will be what we provide for them while they are being cared for and raised: differing only in the complexion relevant to that age.
            <br>&emsp;To return to my inquiry, I am left questioning the merrits and or need for dental work. That, and the neccessity of optics, nutrition, conduct of living, space, education, commradery and being social; that, and the limitations born of childhood, and how travel and employment ought be prepped for and advanced. For it is hard to say what I need as a parent, when the need of my child is unclear. No one debates the need to feed them, and at that whether or not they be fed; but seeing as 'feeding' could vary in constitution, so is it a principle of mine, and at that a fair assumption, that some constitutions will be better; leaving then the question as to what knoweldge or sense leans something as being better; or better said, as having qualities and or effects which are worth higher degrees of approval. "For it is one thing to say that I will feed my kid well, and to do so by not feeding them pop and donuts. But what about the degrees of benefit, and the various forms which things can take to be deemed such. A general measure is what our general sentiment accords, in that we have a general sense of what is good as to correspond with our interest in offering a general benefit. But if we want something riper than that, then so we'll need an equal kind of sense."
        </div>
        <div id="equallyaimed">
            What I seek for my child is akin to what I seek from me, liberty. But this aim is only strong as I truly seek it: and per our desire, our ignornace throws us off. For liberty is under attack; namely from public, or at least what is percieved as public, opinion. For in that, my morals are otherwise to my family, relations and explicilty so to my child. Moreover, I have a propiatated sense as to treat others kindly, help them in need, or at least be kindred in what they say. Surrounding this though is worldly sentiment; be it from the town over, the kindgom, our people's land, or the relation of such commune with others. 
            <br>&emsp;Our sensibility here is not without promise, in that our awarness of such breadth may offer us freedom from the pangs of stretched concepts; which is to say, that in seeing the world, in meters or miles, we are somewhat subject to it as a realm of thinking. Even if our pleasures and effort surround what is local and dear to us, so is there a foregin, if not adversial sense far and abound. And we may, upon being subject to such sense/extent, remove the risk for inflammed fears or passion which a lack of understading of such breadth imbides. 
            <br>&emsp;Beyond that though, there is a frustration which rears deep within me. Namely, there are representatives, and some common discourse, which remarks the affairs of such world, be it from sympanthy or our relation to something. But unfortunately, there is a sense of imperative, and at that a glare of those inflammed passions which we are all to weary of. And it is one thing, upon seeing more of reality and experiencing the doubts of it, and removing such pang, and hearing others who seem equally distressed, and at that doubtfull, but have leaned in, and at that overlooked their ignorance. On one hand, there is the matter of our discontent of others being so impassioned; as such cries of distress flurry our own view of things, and at that reveal more ignornance: making it thus hard to feel sensible enough. It is another thing though, that in our response to such 'increase to the point of content', that we'd be critical of those who are the cause of such; and at that, our cynicims spurrs up as a sort of righteousness, as if what was fair enough to know in order to give our realtion with the world some peace, that so, in others not as situated, that their passion then is some sort of flaw. It may be such, but it is our own sensitivity which prods us to define them. This is a difficult sentiment, as the merrit in seeing them as 'unrigthfully impassioned' is not far off; but taht we are put off by it is more a remark of our self, and the amiability we have to any sort of ignorance. "As if we padded all the edges to an obsessive degree; but upon someone knocking at the door, I flinch: and is that a problem with their manners, or me?" 
            <br>&emsp;So it is hard for me to say that liberty is what I seek, for I am somewhat seperate from the lingering fears brought on by other people's expression. Our own sentiment about the world is both large and ironed out. But our place in life is such that our composure is more peacefull than it is of luster; and so we get thrown off easier by those clambering around. "And indeed this may be a choice away from remedying back to a relation with the world which is not so intruded upon, fairly at least; for she herself shows me her harshest sides, or at least points out where I have imagined concepts. But upon seeing the truth and letting it sink in, it is only our inactive place amidst such conception that has me feeling off, when others are more apparent in their sense that the world is otherwise." That is the route of solitude.
            <br>&emsp;For it seems natural and fair, that our place in the world would be approved of and preferred had we run the course entirely, rather than starting half way through our life. And at that, I can say, in all our best subtly, that our child will have that regard from me. To the effect, that their liberty will be as bound as mine, but not so from reproach and fortuity. And by that, their full strides will keep them steady and unaverse to the crowd's singing. That, and their own strides, as remark the stature and care of a man, will have more means and pleasure in furthering the moral bound; whereby they may be more invovled in kingdom, the world even. "While we are just squandering our ability to at peace with our friends and family." 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, I have a clearer picture what to do. For the same question I have right now, is one that perhaps indicates an awnser; namely, because of our concern, so will our child reach a similar point, where they are asking what they ought raise their child to be, and at that, what is a) their oblige, as a mixture of duty and interest, and b) how they can achieve this without negligence or oversight, and at that, succeed with excellence -so what they offer is not merely good, but swell.
            <br>&emsp;First off, as my need for a child is my choice, so will our child be the same. And by that, as we are given suggestions and care by the assumption that we naturally will want to have kids, that so will my child revieve such assumption. "Not that they must have a kid, but that seeing as they will at some point wish to, how can we rear them for such."
            <br>&emsp;But foremost in our sentiments, is one of liberty, as opposed to confinement. For in one, the means we seek are those which relieve our troubles; and generally, this is the basis for all our actions. But where liberty differs, is that in our success we don't merely indulge in the excess of those elements, but rather propitiate ourselves to to others matters. For seeing the sun bears no need, and at that holds no essential care. But it serves as an instance whici liberties merrit and need reflect. Namely, that of those excesses of what we basically need, so do these, in excess, blunt our ability and care to see the richer things of the world. Second though, is that beyond such pleasant sights, that we may a) wish to see further, and at that better --as to see the sun is not much more than the bright ball in the sky; while in truth it holds a deeper complexion; and b) contribute towards such matters, in the postive sense that we respond neccessarily to the prompts imbued by nature within us, to treat our hunger and fear; only in this case, the draw is towards something positive, as if a satiety to our curiisity and wonder, rather than our baser needs. 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, we could summize our nature as being one of need; but properly characterize such need as some range of emphasis within a domain of interests wishing to be ceasesed (or full); the gambit of which covers our hunger, wonder, reverence, lust. And not to get derailed, but liberty -as we ought mention what it is- is really just a measure of baser successes, whereby the sight of wonder is given the time to seek, be drawn, and at that be heard, when the pleas of our hunger are equally fufilled. The point being, that withtout air, the concern of food is gone, and water at that. But soon, upon the satiation from those and warmth, we reach a point where our finer instruments can open up, be prompted, and oblige our draw.
            <br>&emsp;No matter, the important note is that along those lines of excess, there lies a sort of stubborness and discipline; whereby the means to such satiety are deemed adversarial, and at that constantly fleeing away. Even if we have enough, and so much that we have more than enough often, there sits this attitud of 'and you musn't let it go, for it will flee away'. Because of this though, there is this fear to focus on things beyond those baser matters. And the reuslt is that contents of those matters get overly emphasized, to an indulgent effect. "For people find stability, but act with respect to it in terms of smoothing their efforts spent on reaching so, or applying themselves as to reach deeper means of provision." But the matter of satiety is fairly objective. Not so much in your means to seed what is neccessary, but what is neccessary. For some indeed do not have enough for what is needed; and at that, are fair to value finding said means. But if you have such means, and are situated somewhat as to maintain them, then the goods on offer are additional, and at that uneccessary. Better yet, if the means to neccessity are enhanced, then you are sitting with profits, as your expenses are more or less payed. And to be fair, meeting those finer tastes does cost money, or at least benefits from such; but in that case it is unessential. At least in terms of the employment towards such things. And from that, the primary means to food and shelter is money, while our finer tastes are advanced through attention; which is, upon the satiety of those former, given reign to. And so working for more money, either bears more food, which causes an all likely indulgence; or softens your means to attending to those finer interests. Though these benefits are in some cases mere novelty, and at that, born from distractions and or draining committments; which has more of a negative effect on your finer attentions, as your time is spent immoderatley elsewhere. For circumstances do change, in time and localle, but generally speaking our means to neccessity are small. And so long as we are propiated to the sufficeincy of such, then the manner of means is fair. And at that, if the course to such means is all consuming, so be it. But as much as it is not, so is our excess of time free for finer attentions. "We can at least have this sense in mind."
        </div>
        <div id="cleardeeds">
            To bring this together, our childs life is characterized by our excellent vision of it; whereby the felicitous goods of our finer interests hold the fairer dream. That is our hope at least. And in line with that, so would our child be reared with the sense that they would have a similar interest, and at that the means to foster a similar dream (for their own child).
            <br>&emsp;In this though lies a broad concept, namely of equity. Whereby that sense of furthering our means, and at that the pecuniary goods from them, that so lays the common notion of fortune, and our benefit in nurturing it. I do feel like an obvious weakness of this course is clear, as accruing fortune is not in itself advantageous; as the extraction of the accrued funds for use is needed in order for the benefit to be made. "And it is hard to say when you cut off some of the pie." That, and considering our finer interests, so are the attentions for equity draining in terms of the required maintence and appointment. And as formentioned, our aim is of that dream, whereby our higher interests flourish. And as stated, these benefit only novelly from things beyond our needs. 
            <br>&emsp;As a result, our pecuniary care for ourselves and the family to come, is one which more aptly acheives sufficiency. For it is admittedly a chore to work common jobs; nor do those that offer higher wages and ways leave us with as much rigor as we'd please. In all honesty, our modern sense of this is a litle conflicted; as our current time is indeed privaleged to work from home, and through finer means; which themselves afford higher wages then lower jobs, and are generally more hospitable to our health. Even so, if we were a plumber, so would we be one because we applied ourselve to some better means of providing for ourself. 
            <br>&emsp;In all fairness, the scope of our life is not so easy to state. And from that, there may be but a limited sight, in terms of future decades, which our regards struggle to content. But in general, commnon jobs can leave us robust and provided for; that, and they may be achieved without application. I am merely saying, then beyond one's childhood, that they may infuse their liberty, and privalege of application, to form themselves for preferred means. And at any rate, their broader interests, as remark things of a civil and or professed sort, fall equally under this line. And as to conclude, granting the limited scope of our life's end, that so will baser and or applied means to sufficiency reflect the complexion of our commensurate duties. "Contrasting what they are traditionally, in careers, perk packages and pension." These may hold essential benefits; but each item is to be measured seperated from the nicety of something offering one. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, we can remark the slippery notions of dental, optics, babysitting. Along with the more definite, yet demanding in principle situation, of living arrangments, schooling, and the otherwise commiserability of the expected 'oddities' in this, with the common rungs of the world. The rungs mind you, which hold neccessary elements of infancy, namely in being around other people; along with the likely interests in later friendship, romance, cooperation and esteem. 
            <br>&emsp;Let us start though with that notion of working from home or not. I cannot say how this relates to times of the past; though I give myself some leniancy, in that of the understadning of how our life would go along, by our liberal standard even, that so might those hold more unity via the simplicity of said times; or at least whatever those standards were, so would the nature of work be according to that, and thus not so relevant now. 
            <br>&emsp;I will say though that working from home removes alot of hurdles. For one, it does not impact what our child does, in the way they live; for it is merely a matter of whether we drive to work, complete our shift, then return home, compared to starting our shift at home, being there through our shift for the benefit of pleasure and need, and returning to living all while being at home. There is the question of education and people, but babysitting gets removed primarily as our prescence at home fills the otherwise task. That, and our managment of shifts between my partner and self is simpler, as someone (if not both) will always be at home. And indeed this affords some leaway for a potential partner to work out of home; or myself even if they work from home. 
            <br>&emsp;As regards dental, my feeling is that a great deal of its value comes from remedying what is otherwise a result of ill health. And seeing as health is natural to our dearer interests, and quality of life in general, then so do dental issues reach less prominence. Orthodontics may not be worth regarding; but are cleanings even, which I have not partook in since my younger years, become but situationally required -or of worth. And by that, the regard for them is much further then our cares for routine living, but of some irregular expense. I see optics similarly, and less so even as the presumed cost is likely in the low hundreds, and final at that. While dentistry might hold a higher fee, and regular at that. But of any pretense that it is essential, or advantagous, I'd remark the lack of prescence of it through all but the recent century, and how the manner of health likely causes such concerns, and at that, upon good heealth, alleviates them.
            <br>&emsp;With that in mind, I think it'd be fair to offer a sample outline of our finances. For one, working from home holds no expected difference in pricing. Certain costs of living may be introduced, but the actual means is different. Moreover, there are likely health plans afforded by those at-work scenarios. Though, I must note the general state provision for such. No matter, if I and my partner are equal in income, then 25$ per hour, 20 hours per week, is 4000$ a month. At 30 hours, were at 6000$. 
            I submitt that a car is not needed. Beyond the people our child will associate with, there really is no other need. I can remark the need in emergencies, or in order to meet appointments, but these concerns range in prevalence --considerably moreso during early infancy-- along with preference, as less our child cannot walk, then we can otherwise reach appointments. And there are such things as strollers for all things non emergency. "A doctors visit comes to mind." 
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, what I see, for my life and my partners, is a constance of days which is blossomed through our provisions, into a time full of games, reading, tv and craft; along with local living, and land travels. There is the notion of far off travel, and our childs requisite of walking, speaking, and general sense; but this remark holds with it other matters regarding essential and social need. So no matter, my life, like all others, is local; and mine and my partners life is such, that as adults, we need no car. Nor do we need much more than room for television and sleeping. Floor living is an odd comment, but more or less, a little space for living is fine. Establishing values, we can say that there are indeed preferences, and such as regard sound upon the years of infancy, but in terms of space, only an amount needed for what our lives constitute is required. That, and as much as that is fitting and our life is in motion, so do those preferences loose their luster. Moreso, because our needs are easily met, so can we select places with preferred features, namely location. In that, being nearby a park is a god send, for we, as adults, can walk there, play and read; as can our child go there with us, become healthy, find means for rest and at that interest; and otherwise bear him into stateliness: 'as all adults behave like kids, in their emtion at  least, when their inactive; and so is the risk for our kid (in all his procolviity to do so) less so'.
            <br>&emsp;As a quick note, in terms of savings, as might remark the timely needs of the infant, or the prep required for their presumed need of things, so may we live according to that prep; and in line with our choice to have the kid, so may we act with equal deliberation regarding funds; considering what we need, and taking some time to fufill that. In parallel with that, is the notion of retirement, and how the point in which you can do so, or afford to at least, can be sensed an age prior, and prepped for.
            <br>&emsp;Now, concerning strict funds, the essential matter are those elements of routine living. For all other expenses are unclear, and at that met by our own fortunes and effort. I admitt there may be more, in preference or need; but I also rest on the tenants of simplicity, and how the expectations of others things, however common, relly come because we are undefined in the more basic matters. "And I do consent to taking those matters seriously, as to then afford the leisure of principle and chance." In that, our cost of living as a couple is likely 2000 for rent, or 2500 if more space is needed. Then, you have 800 for food and beverage, and really not much more. In that case, to have shelter and bread, would cost between near 3000, perhaps a bit more. But on those basic grounds, we can afford such working 20 hours a week at 25$ an hour. And as I submitt an honest examination of our needs, I also permitt myself on the basis of the natural increase in wages and time. For the case of our lives is ultimately one of activity; and considering the irrelvance of extra money for such, we'd choose a robust job that pays less yet enough, or work fewer hours rather than more, for the sake of activity. But considering our attempt to have a child, and dreaming even of us both working from home, so could we raise our hours to 30 a week, and at that, go from 4000 to 6000 a month. If our expenses were 4000, which in all honesty, considering 2500 for a basement, and 1500 for food (and no car), so would that extra cash be free for saving. And by that, we could, by our middle class earnings paired with lower class frugality, save 20,000$ in a year. "And who couldn't afford a baby carriage after that." And surely the preperation in terms of tools and some rainy day funds could be made during the pregnancy even. For working at home has that benefit, in that the lesser amount of labor affords those pregnant to work more and later into the semesters.

        <div id="burntremiss">
            Let us begin with ourself.
            <br>&emsp;We are fine, yet somewhat burdened by prior effort. This is normal, yet our response to such ware is where we find trouble.
            <br>&emsp;For in our amends we mean to recover. Yet, in prioritizing such, we are unengaged with other affairs. Personally, there is nothing I lack; yet as regards the ultimate means for family, so are we unadvanced or set. 
            <br>&emsp;Weirdly, our life is best summarized as a fine attempt to be ourself, while giving mere regards to the likely future. We settle ourselves unknowingly, but happily on our principle basis; whereby simplicity, such position in the times, and our otherwise humble needs, fair us no mountainous task. "Will I be able to complete my meager task in 10 years time, I do not know; but I am confident on its simple basis, and our trajectory as dervied from past steps; whereby we can see that we'll naturally improve."
            <br>&emsp;In this though lies our contention. For such a remission from gripping the means to your future is not given much approval, or respect at that. And, as the complexion of our relations with others, so is a scenario where such relations see me as dependant, than so does that whiff of contempt (by said others) make me feel pusehd up against the wall.
            <br>&emsp;I don't beleive this to be the truth assessment; but our feeling is more or less, that our wish to oblige our self, while not being so advanced for the future, and mixed within our scenario of dependance, whereby we have asks and needs from said others who are concerned of such future, leaves me feeling averse, and at that seeking some place without such contention.
            <br>&emsp;But this is not the right statement. For we are fine, and our deeds are realy not so poor in thesmelves, nor so contentious. 
            <br>&emsp;What is really occuring is that we don't know what we want to do. It is not so much that we are clear, but letting the present bloom into the future. Rather, that future is not so defined, and at that, prepped for our gradual possession. Instead, it seems, in all infant garulity, that in our care for rest, and the aversion to others wishing me to focus otherwise, that I in fact seek not so much that gradual advance, and at that permission to be right now, but rather to not advance at all, and simply be: whereby the coarsest of interest comes to parse, namely dreams and gratuity. "For I reach for some concept far ahead, but so rash and lustfull that it only holds bounds within our pondering moment; a point I wish to remain at. Moreover, I yearn for an abandoment for that future, in plans or character, and to otherwise live as though there were no rules at all; so that, be it in gluttony or epicurean ends, so may my current pleasure be the soul amend. All mind you, with a measure of consent or reproach based on such pleasure; the indulgence of which, holds permitt to be, then moderate from. Yet duty holds no right to overstep then retreat: for she is always in need to rightly proceed -rather than stopping, erring, then returing to an idle point of less gratuity."
            <br>&emsp;I might state an unwelcomed remark, namely that  of those around me, who hold so much emphasis of the future, that they do so because there angles and humors are off that stationary being -and the wishes around it. And because life holds no warrant or reward for such effort, so do they learn. "For I know not one grown up who is so able and wise, who wasn't at some point a lustfull teen, or gorging loaf." 
            <br>&emsp;In that it is somewhat easier to see how they learned what they did, and at that believed in; of which we receive. 
            <br>&emsp;But I think in all scenarios, there is a lack of character to begin with; and a remaining abscence upon their 'maturing'. For the point at hand, is that the future is unknown; and despite certain wants and needs, that sensibility and principle can curtail both a satiable and easy satisfaction. Whereas those who age with characters of a contrary sort, are merely forced to move via life's tasks. But they don't suddenly become inbalmed to principled living; merely one which is more appropriate to nature's ways. 
            <br>&emsp;The point to clarify then, is how a state of indolence and gratuity get converted into responsability, and the disposition for it. For the thing I'd note, is that the transition from the former to the latter does not remove the tendancies or cares of the former. Rather, amidst lifes bends, there sits spots in need of oblige. And of such younger wants, so must they be subsisted by such obligations. "As such amends mark the means to be: of which our wants are laid upon." On route of this, one either developes better means to subsist in their younger ways; or such ways become propitated to a life which the obligate ways spurr. For being responsabile does not always excite our younger passions, but rather activites and comforts which are more productive, and at that conformable to the itinerary and effort of our deeds. 
            <br>&emsp;But we musn't flinch from the fair description of what we see. Namely, that as obligations are ahdered to, so does the remaining effort, or time rather, exhibit itself in those younger ways. The colors and hues may alter, or the form rather. But the nature remains; in that you drink one way in the younger state, and in another in the responsible one. "But the orbit of wine remains." In this sense, we could describe someone as a mix of oblige and the character proper to it, and a surrounding medley of in between affairs. 
        </div>
        <div id="needofnecessity">
            By my accounts, the merrit of metaphysics is based on the sentiment of 'neccessity', and its relation to being and goodness.
            <br>&emsp;For on one end, there is a basic inquiry as to how things became, in motion and substance, from nothing; and that even if they held a constant existence, that of there peculiar motions --as to create the features we deem objective-- that so is this equally unclear. For one may say that in substance and motion, that such things are asietic, or constant rather. There still lies though the issue of composites, or the evident objects we see. "Even if all was but a sliver off in terms of trajectory, so would uniformity be absent." And at that, considering reality as a whole, the question lies in the concession that its material and impetus is innate and constant; yet the orientation of each strand is not so clear; or in other words, 'if we take it to be true that there are forms which remark a lack of isotropy, then how does this inherently occur'. For you come to the question of parts and wholes. Considering that all is but a mixture of slight differences, how do such differences occur? The common notion is that, akin to the fabric of a sheet, that so may it ripple here and there, while remaining whole. The mystery though, is what causes any such ripples? There is no evidence that what we take to be objects are but compositions of the slightest ripples. Yet, of such small ripples, why would they compound into the complexities we see today, or in the infant stage of existence, if said ripples were not oriented differently. "For if they were in fact equal in their orientation, wouldn't the result, however extensive due to there being motion at all, be one that was uniform? And thus, how are such strands oriented differently than others, if not for their own uniqueness compared to them. But as so, what springs each piece to be a certain way? Or better yet, less there be some guided emphasis, why would each piece, in its being and end, differ from any other?"
            <br>&emsp;There is something taken for granted in all of this though, and it primarily falls into the thinking that our portion of the supposed 'force', or spirit, which guides all into being, is in fact something for us to reunite with upon our cease of objective being. "As if the food on the plate was done, and all that was left was the platter: the baseness of which, is viewed as something to desire, in that of our deepest end, to be souly with such (baseness), means we have won." And this indeed leads to the sentiment that 'our objective body' as guided by the plate, weighs it down; and thus, upon such release from said body, that the portion of nature's plate is all thats left, 'leaving us pure'.
            <br>&emsp;Science, and indeed sceptical inquiry, 'or a method of advancement rather than angsty conclusion', means to demonstrate that the basis for such notions is unfounded, and at that, truly discover more about nature; and by that, our relation to it. The method of this is one thing, and indeed it differs than the scholastic or abstract. But foremost in the trail of promiscuties (produced by the latter) is the abbrasive notion that without the prescence of a nature which remarks the tenants of such, that the world is otherwise evil. "For how am I suppose to be pure, and at that emablmed with the fairest of things." 
            <br>&emsp;My response is almost impossible, as it ultimatley leans on the strength of our beliefs in the contraries of neccessity. For in that, I say, that the denial of metaphysics is not merely a reorienting  of one's place within it; namely, that per the norm, that in that deeper realm (upon death) we return to, our rebuke of metaphysics does not claim that this 'salvation' is merely denied, but rather the concept of such realm entirely. And the promiscuity in this, is that most folk have little idea of how things move in a 'unneccessary way', that so do they have little concpetion of the 'unneccesary way' of death. And so when I say, that not only is there no realm for your soul, but not a soul entirely, you are left with the mystery of true death. But such an idea ought not frighten us at all. For even if it did, it would be in all likelihood the apprhension of what sent you there, namely things which constitute threats. But the irony is that most folk who have a handle on the soul-realm concept, hold a sort of ambivolence to such threats: 'for they throw me not into a place I'm afraid of; and at that, offer but a different means to the same end: an end which I am all to happy to reach. And the route to such point, in terms of what happens to me (as our own choices do stear us a litte), is generally irrelevant: so do as you please'. And all the while the fear from living stirrs them not, as the consquences are somewhat muted, so are we distraught without such ends in mind; whereby we succumb to the fear of danger, and at that the contention of there being no sturdying end. Yet there is such a place; one which compares to the peace found in rest, or the tranquility in deep sleeping. "A state which, like those, is equally dark, void of dreams or discomfort, nor distaste for the lack of comfort; for like those who feel held by the body, so is such an experience (of deep sleep) one which exhibits the qualities found when one is seperate from the body: death being a mirror of that, but constant."
            <br>&emsp;In that, the truth otherwise considering the illusion of a dual realm and soul, is unknown. But as I know not the truth in the earth's orbit, or the composition of matter, so am I aware of their complexions, and at that character. And as features of a mystery I do not know, so am I content in the qualities of such feature; in the same way that I am all to pleased to not be without air. And by that, beyond our faith in discovery, and at that understanding through inquiry, of the term good, and its contrary of evil, 'I accept the sentence of death in all it's nativety'; the peace of which, makes the truth unremarkable. "For my life, like those subject to danger, yet with ambivolence upon their end's security, is all too gracefull in the meagerest of fortune; in that such a state is colored by an abscence of danger; which upon the removal of beasts and famine, holds little attention by me. "
        </div>
        <div id="grippingourmeasure">
            So a contract is a fair point of security. As are dealings towards one but prospective, but not yet securing.
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, I must state that my views of peoples aims in life, and at that methods to reach them, is ill thought, antiquated, and at that contrary to the purer things worth seeking. But as we are not so imbued by the choices of others, so do I feel like I have to prove our own merrit within the path we take. The problem though comes down to aims; for we are not merely reaching for the same thing but through a different method; nor do we have some way of living which is proposed to reach the points sought by other methods.
            <br>&emsp;Where the notion of contract comes in, is that I see, in our own way of being, that of our confidence in it, that so is it fair as much as we have a contract; which is to say that we are secure in our place -wherever that may be.
            <br>&emsp;For I ultimately feel like we are asked to be something, and at that define ourselves and reach such end. For if we are otherwise, then we are but exploring, inquiring, seeing things as we gradually be; but such a pace is not so respected; and foremost is it tricky to share. For less I communicate why we are not grasping for common ends, or one of our own, then we are left with a sort of shaded development; one which hankers little over the future and its outcome, but merely blossoms as it be's right now. "But it is oh so hard to convene yourself amidst elders, or those inbued to their ways, when to an end you are not endowed."
            <br>&emsp;Our ultimate concern is not one which remarks a soul, but rather a united state of nature in which our forms are merely part of. And to that, our familie's along with our own ends, are in finality such. "So I dredd any reality wherehy the gluttonies of pain are shrewd upon them, or even those primitavley moral and or natural fair; but that they'd be thrown to such ends, is not but assuring; for such finality (in access or complexion) differs not by any entry." 
            <br>&emsp;But so in life ought we work to be pleased; for we need to in many ways, 'less our stomach forever grumbles'. But beyond the natural futility of this, 'seeing as the ends are the same', so can we respect the fact that we are alive, and at that with cognizance of such ends, but all the while we live. In that sense, our idea of the end is but a kind of idea, as would compare to other kinds --of the present or future. And so from that, we can rightfully amend to the cares of our living, and at that settle on that ultimate fact as if it were but a further kind of regard, as compared to those more pressing. "For our fear of death, or address of it at least, is for the sake of fortifying ourself against nearer concerns; as a final sense angles the meaning of everything as to be accordingly set and kept." The crucial sentiment though, is that although all that we do is in peace or attempt for such end, that seeing as such an end holds no 'requisite' to it's entry, but rather a mere understanding as to know its ultimate offer is freely had, that so in our security and rest upon such understanding, can we do as we presently please. 
            <br>&emsp;With that in mind, might we be a little principled in this, and as all past men have, concern ourselves with the aim of our living. 
            <br>&emsp;To be clear, that living and the aim within it hold a warrant for us to address, so has that been stated. "And favorably so, for most of a man's regards are so as to remove unseen or predicted threats (and consqeunces), as to then earn the ease of living as his more 'pleasingly tuned senses' care for." Culture thus is a primary tailoring of such 'unpleasant regards'; whereby the experiences of one's negligence and or ignorance in the world bears them an insight and or lesson to learn, and then share: culture being the sum of attitudes and principles which collaesque said experiences, and faciliate them into societal norms and custom. 
            <br>&emsp;My feeling though, and where I stand, is that as one grievence is dealt with, in food let's say, and another subsquently --upon our attention and care opening up- that so is our final concer of death, and the mystery of being an ending point whereby our fears are dispersed --which the soul, or 'other realm' is neccessitated as the fair attribution. By that, the whims of us which are not endowed and or 'naturally' disposed to aversion and risk have warrant and ease to flair, and in that blossom towards the grades of the world which postively attract us. "The point being that such relations are proportionally stirred, as the whims which brace towards things which appear negative, and at that spurr apprhension, cease." 
            <br>&emsp;Bringing it all together then, the world is a certain way, but considering it as food and platter is flawed. And per older ways, the soul is not a present concept. No matter, the fairer view of death, or one in unity, is such that the experience is A) preferable, as one feels in the deepest of rest, and B) reached by the ceasing of one's form; which exhibits them as not being dead; and as such, occurs by any means which such form ceases. With this being so, our place within such form, whereby the experience of living is at hand, so may we concern ourseles with worries and threats nearer than our final end. "As such an end is not something we must prepare for, but merely accept so much as we care to know, and are insecure without. But in knowing how it is effortlessly reached, and at that not so unfavorable upon entry, so may it, as a mere kind of concern within the domain of all worries, be set aside happily: like our hunger had been satiated, and thus there was no attention brought to mention: all the while mind you, other pangs worth mentioning (by memory or throbbig) can be addressed: and at that naturally orient you as so." 
            <br>&emsp;And by that remark, one may say that pleasure is a servant to pain, 'for no amount of what pleases us could subsit for the oitment to our grasp for air'. And by that, only such a treatment is of concern, and as such a neccessity. But considering that such requirment is met, then so are we free to pleasantly be. "For I am indeed pleased with the air around me; yet this is not effectivley so when it is absent; for I am not then lacing what pleases me, but what I need. In the same way without heat I am desparetly in need; while having enough gives mention to the amount which is of excess, and at that pleasing." 
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, seeing as pain is brought on by a thwarting our needs, then so is an abscence of such need a remark of our natural expression of what pleases us. In that sense, stability is the means to such pleasure; while the weakness of the former bears no fair or effective strenght to the latter.

            So much in life do I think, but in an unclear haze. And although the contents are desirable, so do they lug me down due to that haze; as their permeability gets blurred, and thus I stirr to keep them defined.
            <br>&emsp;In that, I might benefit in stating some terms, then elaborating on them. First, is pleasure, which is not in its own right good, but rather an objective remark; or a description rather, per our common ways, as is the case for the appearence of red, or warmth of a fire. In the same light as a stars motion as seen through observation, yet not known entirely but the mystery of motion in itself, so do such 'descriped', if not experienced remarks, account for all things beyond that mysterious realm; pleasure and pain of which, are but a memebr of such domain. And in that sense, 'the good and bad', in a purely rational sense, sit in those shaded depths --where the sentiments of motion, substance and being lie.
            <br>&emsp;In this sense, the ethics of our time are inconclusive. Or to quote Russel, 'laudible or not, of all theories which pruport a scale for right and wrong, none ought be reaosnably accepted'.
            <br>&emsp;And so in that way, all we have is a presumed, if not misguided attempt towards the real good; and the all to likely prejudice of what we feel to pleasurable, or at least preffered (as found in experience), as a leaning factor towards what the utlimate good either is, or would correspond too, in the sense that of the pleasure we normally experience, and that such an experience is more or less deemed good, than so would the real one serve but a compartively higher amount. 
            <br>&emsp;And like many things, the Humean notion comes to mind, in that of any idea or sense of what the good would be, we are really referring to what we already experience as good, or consider to be; but in that there lies only what is personally positive; and the good seems but a source of something which would offer but a richer form of what we've already experienced. This assumption though, is built on the fact, that of the good, we presume it to be postive upon being with it; and as such, what we've already experienced as positive is but an instance of some other good, differing only in the form of it. And the highest good, or true one which ethics is concerned with, is but the fairest form to acquaint with. The point though, is that what we imagine such a relation to be, and at that worth in doing so, is in the experiences we've already had which build in prejudices of what the true good would bring, and at that be.
            <br>&emsp;For it is hard to say what the good is outside of your common experience. For it is said that the soul binds to our body, and at that releases upon death; and from there finds a the supposed good. "As if being released from the world back into the fairest meadow." This notion though, in its oldness, seems all to promising, and built as such (in the terms) to mould such promise. Besides that, sits a sort of neccessary moulding, as if a lack of knowledge of the good, and thus resolve to it, will lead to evil; or negative experiences rather. Again, this seems to fall prey to the prejudice of what we presume to bad, and thus the motivations for finding the truth and adhering to it bear themselves from the aversions within our experience. Morevover, if we look at things frankly, then the prescence of a soul, and at that other-realm whereby our own portion of such is set for, is not a theory worth accepting. Foremost, is that the basis for it comes from the supposed neccessity of there being so. But per the being of things, so is this but an absent thought as regards the worlds complexion; in that of the phenomena we see, that it is our ignorance to other worldly elements causing such mystery that has us believing something arbitray caused them. Moreover, if we look at the question deeply, we will see, less we have faith in the ways of such arbitrary force, or at least faith in the conduct of it, all the while we understand little of such conduct, that the question left to us is equal to the sensible mystery of the 'piece like' components of the baser world. For no matter our ignornace there, there is almost surely a lingering question of cause, and at that impetus; the origin of substance too. When we lean on neccessity though, we are really permitting ourselves to conclude based on an explantion which we believe is there neccessarily; yet we have no understanding of the ways in which such 'neccessity' occurs. And even if we attribute good intention of it, we merely have faith and not knowledge. 
            <br>&emsp;This creates a permiscious scenario. For the argument may be that knowledge is the mighteous of interests, and faith is but an appeal to what we have no basis to be true, yet believe in by the intention we attribute to such mystery. The contrary of this holds no reign, despite our uncertainty of knowledge. For that attribution of intent is itself born from knowledge; at least, how can you truly say that the neccessity which faciliates the world has you in mind, or if so, is benevolent? And one may say, 'well, that is fair, but having no truth means that we won't know what to do at all; and tradition does indeed fortell the meaness of human nature, and the then required discipline; the conduct of which, is born from the moral refinement that comes from some scale for approval: in which we form ourselves against.' And to this I say sure, that is itself fair. But we musn't make the common mistake of thinking that our fears of uncertainty, or incomplete morality --in truth or givens- is worth anything more than what we commonly deem as unfavorable, and at that worth 'being good' to avoid. In this way, we are left to the givens of reflection and deliberation, and the all to wordly prominence of pleasure and pain; and by which means or another, that so do we give ourselves a natural placement as to be as we naturally are, in terms of such experiences. 
            <br>&emsp;What I mean then to say, is that if we are to marshal ourselves based on experience, then we ought not pretend like the motivations we have are born from anything other. For we do not know if the sentiment of defintiion is fair, or if it is but a linguistic behavor, and at that feature of our nature. In any case, if we mean to live by givens and principle, then we are effectively giving into prejudice, and at that experience; the procedure of which ought exhibit itself through the propieties of evidence and inquiry. "Where we merely account for, then ask; chartering whats been, and where the meaning may be." 
        </div>
        <div id="senseandcause">
            All comes down to being. For I might say that our response to things is featured in our use of language; as is our structural composure a response to gravity; or our use of pens and tools, which are features of our dexterity. 
            <br>&emsp;But in this, lies a sort of trouble, in that how we are is baked into the question as to how anything is at all. For the modern notion is that all, or all of us, is but a part of nature's form, and of our portion, 'so are we a strand'. 
            <br>&emsp;On one end, you have the remark of the earth's orbit, and the insight that the mass of the sun draws it to do so; compared to a heavy object in the center of a sheet, and how it moulds the plane as for surrounding things to fall inwards ---or orbit if they have their own initial vecolity, as to create centrigul motion. In this case, what was a blatant observation of the earth orbiting the sun, as the moon orbiting the earth, so was this not itself the point in which the depths of reality lay: beyond that is. Rather, it was as if a deck of cards formed into a tower, and of such form that was all you saw. But upon inspection, you saw the cards, and at that the actual elements in question. But as for their own basis, so would that be closer to any supposed 'depths'; compared to the higher form at least. 
            <br>&emsp;In terms of knowledge then, we have what is apparnet, and at that regarded. But deeper as we go, so do things which appear phenomal have some objective reason. And indeed, the faith in reason is such, that no matter how deep you go, or better yet, considering the depths to which we've been, we still hold faith that a) more light will be shown, and b) that any mystery per the level we've reached, holds a rational explanation below.
            <br>&emsp;In this way, our knowledge can be expressed by sentiments which are observed and understood, and those which hold either a faith as to their rational cause, or one of an arbitraty sort --which we presume neccessary. 
            <br>&emsp;Considering that, our model of life is such, that the phenomena of language and sensation are but nestled in the rocky alcoves of objectivity. And like all chemical elements, which serve as the deeper reasons for higher forms, yet hold themselves a rational source in particles and forces, that so are the subjects of language and mind elements of an equal sort; only, like all dinosaurs that were, and of the fossils which remain, so are the discoveries of mentality but remains of something not yet uncovered; yet with faith, we believe they are there; and at that, our model states that such things are not but ill-observed elements within the higher world. Their pecularitiy, and at that need to be further observed, does remark the mysteries of the deepest of things. For the nature of iron is not much more than the nature of charges and forces particularly arranged. Yet, while iron is quite understood, as an object and with cause, so is the deeper mystery of its cause more easily set, 'for we are clear what the mystery's towards'. While the mind is not rightly presumed to be a part of the world in a distinct way compared to all other things; but in its own way, we hold smaller definitions and much ambiguity. And considering then that for nearly all things the deepest basis is unknown, then so is the link between that and the unclear effect of 'mind', a hotspot for ill-concieved imagination. "For we tend to define that deeper cause in order to anwser the pecularity of the consquent object of the mind; yet the ill-clarity of the latter awkwardly motivates the cause of it to be a certain way; for we both have too little guidelines to propose such cause, and at that, a awry bias in our want to understanding such mindfull effect, to the ends that we make the cause of it in such a way that what we suppose and or preusme the mind to be, as then caused by the manner of something which we deem neccessary to produce what we assume as such. Yet within the mystery irony lay."
            <br>&emsp;At this point, it is only fair to resort to inquiry. And as one in the past may have resorted to faith in the esteemed causes which they held as being with intent for them, that so may we, in the denial of that, and otherwise ignorance of any pre-concieved form or being, that so our faith lies in the frontiers where reason lay.
            <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst these rules, is that in attributing the cause of something apparent with the properties deemed essential, you are still subjecting your understanding of such to the measures which knowledge is found on; and accordingly, if your understanding is ill-placed and guided, then of the truth you do not know. "It is as if a ball was in motion, and your prompted as to whether it came to be so by means of its identity, or another's. And in attributing the latter to something beyond, you really are placing it as nothing more than a prior dominoe; with properties of an esteemed kind mind you, but of properties no less." Asserting then that such properties are present because the effect which they are esteemed to cause could not be so otherwise, is a proof that holds little resistance to all but the faintess wind. 
            <br>&emsp;Indeed though, certifying this as the base of our inquiry is in itself essential. Namely, why the properties of a cause, as relate to its effect, cannot, nor would not be so if in fact, as stated, 'were neccessary, for the effect could not otherwise be'? How is this not true then? Is the attribution wrong, in terms of what is deemed to be required for the effect, and thus the cause? Or perhaps the cause is credited with an end which is itself misunderstood. As if we saw red, but were decieved from the truth in it being a different color. For indeed this is where metaphysics lies, in that weaving of cause and effect. In all fairness, the latter is quite easy to isolate, and formulate as something false in the end attributed to the cause. Yet, even with accuracy to the effect, there still lies something essential. And one's faith in reason is akin to the belief that a discovery will be made. While the belief that the cause produced said effect due to something neccessary, is all but the toughest claims to refute. For I do not know any reason for the effect; and at that, denying the property lauded as the cause, or amidst the being of said clause, is without much validity beyond the speculative prejudice I have; in terms of explaning something by an irrevent factor distinct from the effect itself, but something imposing upon it instead. "While it is not much more than hydrogen and oxygen being that corresponds with their binding into H20. Yet the force of their meeting is the question. Only then though, are we left with the prescence and slight differentation of the field which exhibits the basic particles and forces. And I find little meaning in the neccessity banked on as the explanation of that."
        </div>
        <div id="truthorinquiry">
            Of ends, so may we falsify attribued means on the basis that the effect of such cause is in itself ill-founded. "So and so is the source for this thing happening; but if that thing is in fact not happening, in dynamics or substance, then so is the proported clause false. At least, that gravity causes the earth to orbit the sun is true, but that it causes our heartbeat (its rythyn at least) is not a reason which falsifies gravity, less it is proposed as the source for so."
            <br>&emsp;Propositions then are a tricky statement, for falsity and truth therein lie. Yet description falls a little short of what they offer, in that their aim is one of explanation, while the other is merely observation. No matter, if I say that iron is but a meddley of particle, so is this true; while saying that quarks are a meddley of particles is not; but this holds no bearing to either of the subjects, rather the quality of their stated relation. 
            <br>&emsp;In this way, one's faith in reason is really one or refutation towards the claim that in being or substance, that so the basis for thing lays. For I may say that atoms are soul, and at that born from the qualities neccessary to proport them. But in doubt, and upon findings, I may deny that, and use such evidence or reasoning to support my falsified claim. 
            <br>&emsp;Where we lie then, is how even the deepest of understandings will be either a) born of reason rather than neccessity, and of such matter known, or b) how in our doubts and or thinking as to the further depths where reason lie, how we know that, at the very least, nothing other will do, whether we have any glimmer of hope, or merely have faith in so; and as such, rest on our uncertainty and inquiry, encouraged by faith and at that the revelations through progress, all the while we care little for, and at that seek to deny, the sentiments which exclaim some non-rational basis for things: as if reason, or its promsing depths, hold nothing more but what neccessity is required to grow. 
            <br>&emsp;That is our trouble. Not the strenghts of our inquiry, and at that encouragment of the gains so far; but whether it is futile to look deeper or explore, but instead accept the infalluable fact that the features we seek explanation's for, are so from something not discoverable; or in other words real, but rather transcendetally moulded and guided. 
        </div>
        <div id="stainedcloth">
            In this way, the canvas of reality is painted two fold: of completeness, be it of the real we suppose real or not, but entirely so, or of distinction, or otherly rather realms: transendance if you will, whereby that existent realm is cushioned by some resonant other; and of such other, so is it the source for substance and being, i.e properties of mass and magnitude. While the soul realm, or one which, akin to pantheism, is entire, is not one that sees its elements as imposed upon, but rather with immanence. 
            <br>&emsp;For each there is a difficulty; though one seems less laudible. In the dual realm, there lies the mystery of how the other-realm functions, and at that, of its own nature as the guiding force for the real realm. While the complete realm, holds the weakness of ostentation, whereby we ad finitum reach the defintivie quandery of space, form and differentiation. In this case, we can say, that the speculative theory of entirey, is such, that of the complexity we see, so is it sourced from an aggregation of the meagerest differences; the apparent effect being but a compounding of the real entities, and their slightly slivered differences sewing together. 
            <br>&emsp;In some sense, the dual real theory is perhaps the most skeptical. For it does not propose how such other-realm faciliates the features of extistence we see. Instead, it is generally deemed by neccessity that the means to such existence are caused by properties which are not themselves real or explanable, but merely required for anything to be at all. For our point was that the nature of such other-realm was not itself understood. But we are then attributing characteristics to it which we find in existence. "As if there were motions in the other-realm which spurred the motions in the existant realm." But this is not the actual claim of the theory. Rather, it states, that unlike existence, which ebbs and flows in certain ways, that the other-realm, or neccessary cause, is not itself real, and at that subject to any understanding as we'd find in the effect it produces. Personally, this is the frankest statement of, 'it is what it is'; which to me, as a ultimate theory, is quite skeptical. Though, in all fairness, the nature of such theory is such, that it does not support any inquiry into the conduct of its cause; but rather accpets them --with right statement-- as required for the explantion we seek to be claimed.
            <br>&emsp;The main issue though, is where do the neccessary, or otherly qualities and the existant ones begin. For we may say that being is innate, and at that, the effect of motion is born from some unqualified force. And we may accept this as true. Yet, understanding how such a force produces the motions we see is mightliy unclear. At that, we can rightly falsify any 'neccessary' statement on the basis that the effect in question is not fairly stated. Which itself, holds a reccessive issue, in that, as effects appear in their composite form, that so is their actual form an unknown point in which said neccessary causes would unfold. And in that sense, it is quite hard to say what any neccessary cause is, when the proported effect of it is unknown. "For how can something be attributed a cause, when there is no clear effect for it to be a source of. How can we state something as being the means, when there is no (fairly stated) end for it to be reckoned as spurring. For it would seem that of such end, that so is it so, and as such reasonably deemed, by a cause which is in such  a way as to create such end. Yet, of such way, how can we rightly say what it is, when the ends which said ways are reckoned to be so as to create such end, are not themselves known." 
            <br>&emsp;To me then, the weakness of an imposed theory, is that it does not question the composite nature which we mean to explain; moreover, it cannot say what the true elements are, in the early 21st century at least. And that, so much as this weakness holds, 'whereby it affirms a cause to an end with no further basis', than so are you left with a never ending point of real-explanation. For less we rightly and or wrongly affirm the identity of something, and thus subject it completely as the thing for which a cause is proported to make, then so is it fairer to expect that our perpetous discovery of the identity of things will illustrate the explanation which we affored to those 'neccessary causes'. In that case, ought the soul question of our inquiry be, 'at what point do we affirm; at what point does our curisoity feel satiated by the things we really know?' For death, mind, space and magnitude may be understood in the way that we've learned about light, mechanics, organics and such. To which we have one question to ask: is there any more worth to our inquiry? For if every person were adbundantly pleased, and absent of pain, nor were there any doubts of the entrence and or quality of our tranistions within existence, and at that any such doubt as to the conduct of existence as it pertains to our relations with the world, and that such relations were based on findings which held forward and true by the constance of said nature, and at that the lack of suspension and or intrusion, then so might we merely settle some finer despairs, namely in the realm of language, and the other features of the mysterious sides of existence; all the while though, we held no trouble at all but accepting our peace and liberty through life and the stream of infinity. "For at that point, as man, for pleasure, and in the richest of states, are we charged with being as we are liberty to see fit; and by that, forgo, and at that shed, off those behaviros and concerns of primitive disposition."

        <div id="softwords">
            So I am here, in Pitt meadows. And I'd like to remark a certain bit of closure; namely of the relevance of other people's thoughts, and our otherwise begrudgement about not being invovled with the things they are so flippant about. In that, we normally feel like the advice, and our wisdom and fair guidance, say to mind your own buisness; attend to it at least. But in doing so, we tend to feel like we are ignoring the buisness of others; which I can only say, in our simplicity, does not hold any fear in me; but there is indeed the hurt you sense in others. And at that, I feel conflicted in disposing our time and attention to our own efforts, all while 'the apparent distress' of others is left for someone else to tend. 
            <br>&emsp;The point however, is that despite this feeling, so is right that our idea of this would be well-founded, and that we wouldn't let imagery, rhetoric, quick conlcusions form our idea of things; and at that, so would individual circusmtances be but random occurences; while remarking upon the world could only be done so with a broader sense and statistics. And upon that view, so are the ruffledness of others response to near sighted views, encourage me to think of the greater good. But so as remarks our irreverence to the seamingly odd occurences, yet amidst a world I am either ignorant of, or with the sense that it is normal, and at that not so pointed towards another's suffering, that so in this approach, are we left with the right mindest. Yet, we feel that others remarks about it are so caved in, and at that full of irratable confusion. Only, what I see is that despitre there being this way, and in such a way as remarks passing conversation, or that at a dinner party (so to speak), that so is it assuring that such moments of seemingly 'in tune' disccsion, despite the empty custom and falir of it all, is all but a moment whereby people's social strides combine with their ignornace, and they say 'trump', or 'get this'; but so do they move on, to occupation, seperate converstions, or relevant interests to their day. And by that, I am not upset to be outside such discussion, and begrieve at that consquences of such flaunty conversation. Nor, do I fear taht such converse leads to irriatbale reactions; as if people would then contribtue towards a the problem they think has occured, and at that be rebellious, dissarayed, anarachic, and brutal. "There is not much of that outswide the despots of Cairo or Sudan."
            <br>&emsp;There will be more developments upon that sure; but what I can say, is that of the fairer view of the world I see, and at that the reproach towards such view, whereby our judgement is suspended, I think I can appropriately be as a single man within the extent of the world; and at that, consider our place within such extent, all the while we are begrieved not, or nor affraid, of flippant and or passive remarks regarding faintly viewed things.
            <br>&emsp;In that way, I have little to comment on in terms of proper custom. What I can say, is that we are here, in Pitt Meadows, lauding the bounty of fruit. And beyond our rustling harmony of concerns I ought to approve, so are we left with the normal course of our life. I can say that health is a prioirity, and besides our moral remarks and enlightenment reading, so is there little but our woodland ventures and homely actions. These are all nice and plenty; though I am somewhat unsure of things in the near term, and so paying 50$ for a short campagin, additional map area, and new game mode, seems a little rich consdiering the means we have. I am not sure if I am overly excited to merely try the base mechanics. 
        </div>
        <div id="dutiedexpress">
            Might I iron out a loose thread in my mind, namely that of variable forms of discussion; be it promotional, organized, civil, or more along the lines of scoffing and barking, or being talkative and social. 
            <br>&emsp;None truly bother me. For the latter kinds do not lead heavily into the effects aimed at by the former. It is true that such aims are in relation to our representative interests, and at that the right by said interested to democratically convene. But in the case of talk and scoff, so is this quite seperate from the choices eventually made; and at that, any reall contribution to the matter: be it positive or of revolt.
            <br>&emsp;In terms of those organizes and deeply expressive, so are these doing what is fair and appropriate within a state of affairs which faciliates itself on public consent. Whether or not that public is really influenced by said expressions one thing; and that, so much as they are, if it is towards revolt or educated consent, so lies a mystery. "For I remark the recent sentiment of class and orientation equality, and the general scoffing of folks who see such statements as 'over the top'. What I see in fact, is not that in the common walk of theres or any ones lives, that such expressions remark an actual change; beside the barest and most deeply packed policies; but instead, there thrown off by the notion due to ignorance, and how such ignorance thwarts their sense of normacy and security: the consquence being one of hidden fears that they are being supressed, and at that, upset by an equaly deep sympathy for someone other who they feel is being oppressed."
        </div>
        <div id="theeveryday">
            So it is all to concerning when a person draws their view of the world by the incidents they see. For presumably, there sentiment is one that remarks a supposed world as to produce such incident. 
            <br>&emsp;I would illustrate things this way. There is a light source, and it shines in all directions. Then, there is debris, scattered if you will surrounding it --a spherical orbit. As the line shines, it catches such partciles and creates a sort of figure; of which we are impressed. 
            <br>&emsp;By my accounts, the government, or culture at least which is mixed in, speaks to the light; while the surrounding material in which it shines marks the actual tenants of the world, in people namely. And so if some incident is seen, there is generally two responses: 'man, people are crazy', or, 'damn, those people (of a country or place) are messed up': that, or it is 'why does the government allow this? Like did you see what some guy did: the states is nuts'. Of that  latter, it might be better to state it as a sort of confused irriation, as to how either a people or state can permitt such things, and at that, not remedy them in some supposedly proper way.
            <br>&emsp;The main point I would make, is that not only is the light source as less than prominent cause of those impressions we, compared to the elements shined upon, but that even so, if such light was what caused such a figure to occur, that so would this not speak to the other elements being shined upon. For in that, the glimmers of oddity and despair speak out in ways that both eagerly and crookedly catch our eye. Yet it is perhaps a fair definition of ignorance to say, that being unware of how the less than striking forms appear, and at that, having no solid basis as to ground your impression of something odd, speaks to something worth our concern, in terms of someone exhibiting such ignorance and rashness.
            <br>&emsp;In our own way then, an ignorance as to how people are in general, and at that groups of them, in general or specifically, makes room for our own irrations upon hearing someone else be so rash; as we attribute their feeling to be one of commen sentiment, which is an alarming feeling, in that you perceive the common folk as then being rash. Yet, I  find it important, that even if we suspend or own judgements, and are not elated by incidents, that so is someones contary response but an incident itself, and at that, not often an incident which holds huge amounts of weight. "For someone who is rash and negative, and at that flippantly topical,  but an instigator to other people's shared proclivites; but as such, is not an expressor of something many people care for or respect; and thus, doing so yourself is seldom rewarded; and of such aversion, so may others get sucked into to being equally unappealing. But akin to a mob, which supports others who get invovled in their fury, that upon the mobs cease, so are you left out in amidst the prefferred customs; to which you stand alone as you remain rash, or you then revert back to the acceptable ways."

        <div id="sourceforprinciple">
            What ought a man ought to do? I cannot say I know. As regards felicitous pleasure, and peacefull absence of pain, of that I know quite much. But that such a principle would be invoked, seems but a personal pursuit; and at that, not what others exhibit around.
            <br>&emsp;Oddly though, it is not so easy to describe their efforts as anything but. Only, it seems what is regarded as worthy of concern, and otherwise worth seeking, is varied from mine. In that, the notion of utility and pleasure is quite universal in its appeal. And only the apolagists or endowed saints (and their disciples) have much character or need for qualities which pertain to something beyond life. They are not unwise on the whole of it though; for their efforts keep their pleasures moderate yet fair, and their pains at a minimum; nor are their duties dealt with in toil. 
            <br>&emsp;In that way, the principle one uses is always the mighty question. For in the advancment of whichever point we choose, so are we fair to accept the knowledge we have, and merely make do with it while we further learn. At that, assessing things in terms of a principle is as easy as such a thing is understood. "For the sweetness of soda will offer such and such; but of one of those offerings, in the glycemic load namely, in terms of utility contrariety lays." 
            <br>&emsp;Indeed, it would be proper to better define such principle. For if the mere sentiment of pleasure is whats regarded, then such sweetness of soda may remark a higher good than that of an orange. But if the scale for measurment includes in it qualities such as accessibility and consistency, the latter being a mark of what the good from health can afford, then the effect of soda despite its sweetness does not align. 
            <br>&emsp;What I find tricky though, is that in deciding on the principle of utility, or that of idoltry, so there lays a deeper mystery than the mere alignment of comprable things; but rather the actual discovery of what a) the complexion of such principle should be, and b) what the core of the principle is based on; or in other words, what merrits deciding one principle over the other. For that latter mark strikes me as something quite overlooked when it comes to orienting our morals and interests. And the likley reason, is that of whats required to learn about a principle, and at that what bears promsie to a principle of any sort, that in such needed discovery to establish such basic things, that by legacy and it's continued propogation, so do the contents relevant to such discovery already appear to be stated. Just as one may say, that in utility, that accesibilit ought be a concern. For the pleasure of a donut may be fine, but not if you must hike a mountain to recieve it. While the pleasure of a deep breathe, and the creative strides that merrily come, holds a sort of good that is born within, and from there simply. This is all part of the discourse as pertains to objects and their relation to value. But as the alignment of such things is but a matter of understanding them, that so in the acceptence of the principle by which such things ought merely be appropriated to, that our establishment of said principles are comparably based; in that, of certain truths and or insights about the world, whereby the apparent nature of things spurrs the principle we have, so is such knowledge which principles are derived from not full or founded. And at that, as we take for granted the principle in question, and spend our time assessing the subjects fit for it, that so do such principles come in by a similar way; whereby we take for granted the nature of things, and merely assess the principles fit for it. "Yet in that, the ancient waves of tradition hold too mightily a claim. And with much evidence to, for the tug-O-war between values newly established in the 16th century and those developed from establishments in antiquity, mark the trajectory in which governments and cultures have come. Quite unfortunatley, the larger wars within the recent past, seem merely a result of the major powers fending off those whose 'state of living' was born upon the developments of such ancient-modern conflict. In Germany namely."

            So the nature of things is such, that via observation, both our mind, and its otherwise ambigious counterpart of matter ---and converseley- are but composites of baser things. Such things appear to be nothing more than excitations of basic fields (and or field), which exhibit the properties of particles and forces. For the former, you have up and down Quarsk; two of the former and one of the latter create a positive charge, while one up and two down create a neutral charge. The gluon initates the binding force between the quarks, as to create the charges and charge relation: the body of which (of postive and neutral charges) is the nucleus. Surrounding the nucleus are electrons; and the amount corresponds to the amout of charges in the nucleus. As well, more electrons there are, the further out will they be disperesed from the nucleus: these are valence shells. Via the electromagentic force, the electrons bind to electrons orbiting other nuclei; such a union forms an atomic bond, and at that a molecule. These molecules interact with others, and as pertains to life, so are cells made. A union of cells is termed organism; and within said organism, different kinds of cells joined together is called tissue. In animals, these tissues form organs. And in terms of sense, it is all to clear that what we mean by that, is some sort of impression, and some mysterious response. 
            <br>&emsp;Such an interaction is of a compositie type; in that, of visions case, the light coming in does so individually, and by the various points of input, as reflects the coordinates of points within our field of vision, so are our senses excited in such a way. Our percpetion of such an impression, and in a composite way, is in itself comparable, in that, as the input is but a collection of light-streams, and so as to create proportions, so is our response equally composite, in that of the collected input, so is it harnessed and exhbited (to our  perception) in a compositionally assembled way. Cameras serve as an example of this. In their inital form, light would hit a surface, and a firming chemical would be placed as to hold the 'more or less relfection, or proportioned glimmer' into the surface. Illustrating this though in depth, there were indiviudals light-streasm that hit particular points on the surface. Upon each point hitting its respective spot, so was the binding agent exhibted to that point, by the piece of such agent as was placed at such point. Our brains potentially differ though, in that of the collective input, that so is this brought in, as if a solidified impression, but therein dispersed to various points of the brain for perception. The question, is whether the collected input is sent as a whole to each point, or if each point which indivudlaly came into the senses, goes to a corresponding point of the brain; by which each brain-point which recvies an according input-point, offers an according point of perception: the total being a composite perception. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps the ambiguity comes from the total-view of the sense-appartus. For it is not so true that a left and right point come in, and as a line, are inputed to the processing parts of the brain; whereby the left goes to one recpective point, the right the other. Rather, the actual input-apparatus is a point system itself; so that the left input impressess  itself to a certain spot on the appartus, and the right equally. And my feeling, is that each spot on the input-appartus corresponds to a recpective point. 
            <br>&emsp;This feels very Humian, in that, of our composite perception, it is more likely that the experience of  perception is but each processed point offering its own pointed perception. The act of processing into perception is one thing, be it whole or composite. But we can say, that whether the inputs are processed and something else is made aware as to call perception, or if the processing brings on the perception more innately, that so if if a left point came in, was processed then perceived as a point, that the adjacent right point being processed does not in fact lead to the perception of a line, but rather the perception of a right point and left one as parallel with one another: yet, per the Humian notion, that only each point is per itself percieved. "And perhaps via the actual means to perception, that the experience of said points being parallel, and at that a line, occurs." 
            <br>&emsp;In other words, that one perceives compositionaly is fucntionally true. But that, of the composition, or seemingly whole object which we normally see, so is the means to that unclear, and at that, unevident that such a unity is actually occuring. "And not a sholl of perceptions of the elements of the composition; leading perhaps to the sense of unity by their being enough elements to actually consit of something composed; yet we are in our ignorance and naievty fooled into thinking that the breadth of compositionla elements are in fact the thing composed." As if one really thought, in terms of tissue, that their body was whole, and not a bundle of cells. 
            <br>&emsp;Though, in all things, it is hard to the baser elements, and at that, affirm the prescence of actual points, as opposed to a whoole. For the truth in that matter, is that compositions of the mental kind, like those atomic, may be but feeatures of an otherwise univseral fabric, who's unaltering ripples create the seeming effects of otherwise seeming elements; only such elements are in fact mere ripples in complete fabric. For otherwise, if there are indeed pieces, then the magnitude of them is unclear. As for substance, so is the source of that in terms of a whole fabric equally unclear. Nor is the source of its ripples, as to compound into via differenation, clear. But in that, the question lies in the movement for something complete and entire, and not so of a vast amount of distinct things. "Who would need some source of motion which brought them into each others company. While the fabric needs only a gust of wind; for in the consquent ripple, so is each seeming strand already strung together."

        <div id="simplycomplex">
            That all being said, it is fair to say that the form of nature is very basic compared to the complex objects apparent to us. And our perception is, arguably, nothing more than an exhibition of such simplcity, but in a peculiar form. For the motions of particles is either a) basic, or b) a feature of baser magnitudes; and thus water is a relatviely complex form, regarding motion. And our mind, as in the complexities of tissues and DNA, are but a equal kind of complexity. The mind is perhaps foremost; but our ignorance and confusion, seems the cause of us thinking that it is something distinct from those other complexities; and at that, per its special form, that by the mystery of how any form is at all, that so is the mind subject to a unique part of said mystery; whereby we attribute some neccessity to the baser motions of things, as if imposed upon; and that the mind is uniquely impposed on, and at that, in relation to the imposition: and its sender. "This comes from the ambiguity of perception, and its seeming governance by us; and from there, it seems like such governance is in line wiht, or tapping into and thus in relation to, the otherly source which imposes itself upon all things; and that perhaps, in imposition that the mind is uniquely subject to, that so is our mind such as to seemingly connect us with the special portion of the general imposition. 'Gods heart, rather than the clap of his hands."
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, of the nature of things is thus, than history merely lays as a precedent to our current undertanding of this; and it acts as a sort of disposition which modernity must reorient itself from. 
            <br>&emsp;One of the key principles for man, is that considering the past, that the explanation of change, as has come and will be, as that the evident mistakes of the past were such that, of those holding them, that the evident falsity merely led to incongruety with nature; thus causing more pain than ought be made, and less pleasure than ought be had. And because, generally speaking, our beliefs are esteemed by their output of such, that so was an experience which brought litte something which spurred us to inquire and advance. And the insight I have, is that the resistance to doing so tends to occur when the point of suggestion revovles around beliefs that people are afraid to change; and by that, the content of such beliefs is almost typically in the ways and aims of idoltry. Governance holds similar whims and cares; but the turbelence in that is more than not drawn from the conflicts of devotion. For it is not so hard to say, that of our devotions, that they are not in fact promsiing for anything beyond life; nor are they advantegous to life, 'as nature does not change'. As regars morals, these are commonly argued in favor for devotion due to the collective harmony, and at that ethics within such resolve. Only, the actual contents of the deovtion are not themsevles true; and at that, it seems fairer that an agreement to what was true was the requirment for collective harmony. Indeed the nature of devotion is one of worship and oblige; and one may argue that without the sense of some fatherly and or threatening judge, that people will not act suitably. 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, histroy lays as a sort of superstition to the divine, and the esteemed qualities which follow; but equally, resits any usefull change via the strict contents of such devotion. I cannot say entirely, but it seems that the point in which man had begun to inquire and ask, that the initial beliefs he had, and at that devotion, barred him from doing so: indeed causing the great war of man. 
            <br>&emsp;From that, I am not convinced that the nature of things has been properly defined; nor has any moral pretense of what is required for man to properly be, been rightly stated. For all the experience one has to suggest such a thing, is born from an age, or eon even, where man has been nothing but devoted. Yet in all the fraility of that, there has not been a point where an devotion to something true has been done; or that he has, in mass community, co-existed withotu devotion. It feels more historic to say, that in mans communion, that upon the core of it being harmonized by devotion, that all war and petulance was born. Now, in the modern age, or approach to it at least, the sentiments of the day are of liberty and discovery: and the riches are so expansive, that even those who we accept will in poverty lay, hold in fact similar riches. "The wilds of Africa, be it in the jungle or Sudan, is barring a complexion of the fortuned world: whereby it, and most others, are becoming developed, at that of the first kind: second even, as reached with a relatively recent and quick pace, would be dispproptialty fine."
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the contrast to modernity is in the remants of the prior age. Namely, the cultures and custom which centre themselves around the objects of devotion. But the conflict in life has come primarily from those seeking to achieve the goods and utility from living; while their opponents are those stuck in the past cares of divine goods. "But upon mere examinations, you may find much strenght to believe that such goods are made by those who propogate the merrits of devotion, for the sake of moral harmony, but in fact know nothing more than the past experiences of morality as it pertains to devotion --and thus they know no community based upon liberty and natural oblige--- nor do they say, rightfully or not (in their falisty), how such devotions are in fact true, beyond their utility; for the heart of their validity comes from illiterate and 'telephoned' testimony, and the otherwise confirmations as are prejudiced by past falsity, or the pressures from custom to do so." 
            <br>&emsp;In all of this, per the actual world, lies the broken core of Germany: through the world wars at least. For, upon Rome's demise and the Barabarian settlement, the eastern portion of Gaul came under rule of the soon to be Holy Roman Empire: Charlemgane and his father to be exact. By this legacy, the split of Germany and France saw the former as bishoped by the church, and at that, culturally endowed with the contempory notions of the Church. Upon the reformation, Germany was the foremost ruined; as the influences of the surrounding countries, upon the slightest impression in Germany, saw the highest offence: to which the country, in what is known as the thirty years war, lost a third of its population. From there, the powers of England, Spain, Russia and France grew. And indeed, modernity lent its hand equally to all of them, including Germany. But upon the Napolenic and Prussian wars, the country of Germany was hoddled beneath the strenghts of England and France. Upon the Ferdinand asssination, the lines were drawn, and Germany (and its ally in Austria Hungary), lashed out, seeking conquest. They indeed drew allies (into the central powers); while the remaining countries, who's more liberal aim was continue advancing their internal means of propserity, merely unified in order to defend themselves, and at that, cease the threat. England sought no conquest; nor did Russia and France. It was Germany who sought much; and upon their defeat in the first war, the ruins held much motive for a drastic leader to come in; and weilding the prejudices against other cultures and ethnicities --in order to gain power, and rally the public-- so did the holocaust, along with more attempts (and successes) for conlfict ensue. Allied again, the rest of the world --barring Italy and Japan-- dealt with the woes of such tradition. "For upon liberty, which England and France notably embellished, the aim of man was not to overtake and at that supercerde, but to flourish, for utility; the tenant of which held no difference between man other than that of his past. But in the present, in the lands more or less established, would he cooperate, and by his able and relished means, proceed. While the flair of Germany held the ashes of devoted policy and conflict; and despite the falir of liberty that incorporated itself through modern days, compared to the surrounding powers, the roots of Germany prominently lay."

            Life would be so easy if we could just try and be happy. But there is this principle which holds me back from such satiety.
            <br>&emsp;And I can't say why. Nor can I clearly say what such principle is. It has to do with someone asking if you wan't to go out and have fun; and you reply with,'what will that consist of'; and they say drinks and food. And I have always said no to this; and felt quite incongruous with most people who otherwise would.
            <br>&emsp;At heart, the principle is one of standard over taste; as not to drink soda despite its flavor, and thus avoid the glycemic overload. Moreover, the good which come's from such refusal, is more than a mere avoidance of pain; for soda does not bring much which is terrible. Rather, it allows for the promulagation of creative and or tender interests and cares; and at that, by avoiding the soda, you also avoid its contrariety to such an experience. 
            <br>&emsp;For none can rightly say that your rigor and accuity holds little effect to your more invovled experience. One who drinks can surely do so and still enjoy the drimking, or the food and lavish converse. But the principle we abide by, is such that all toil is removed from our labor, nor is there any short amount of steadyness through our days. There is little fear, no sickness, no boredom. But our fun then, comes from things we do. And despite the actions invovled with partying, so is there little which is actually done; it's more like a festival, whereby the candor and vibes provide a sort of liveliness and excitment. But when you consider the actual acts you do, its more about taking it in. Our interests are purely in tasks, namely in reading essays and texts, writing more or less constrcutively, but heavily in a reflective and or considerate way; we play games of all sorts, from Witcher, Battleifeld, Ark and Civ; and we sink into shows such as Star Trek and Seinfeld; nor are we beyond the pleasure of long ago videos, 'whereby the times and character hold our interest'.
            <br>&emsp;As a child find's fun in making things, running around, breaking rules, seeking adventure, so as an adult, am I more inclined to heartier experiences. I bear myself upon them with equal luster, but also with the neccessary care and oblige in order to see them. It is not easy to watch a movie you've seen several times before, or a show at that; youtube is like this even moreso. Nor do games grab our attention when there similarly old, or in need of ingenuity and investment. Nor can I write when I've little to say; which almsot entirely comes from curiosity and affirmation; but such is lacking when my interest is dulled, and thus there is no care for inquiry; or I am restless or impassioend, and merely declaring how our fortune's will be. 
            <br>&emsp;I just simply invest myself into an array of books, writers, reflections, films, shows, youtubers and videos, along with various kinds of games, whose discourse and development brings me to relish; and at that, I am fond of nature, in her colors, form and shine; nor does her constancy of such offerings ever dissapoint. And surrounding this, is a relatively effortless mode of being; whereby work is nothing but the smallest employment; nor is our health and reasoning but a fostering of such ease. I am never sick, nor am I in any trembling way tired. I am always walking, listening to music, sitting upright, writing, enjoying, playing.
            <br>&emsp;And from this experience, I can say, that by chance or complacnency, that I see how certain items impact said experience. Namely, sitting in chairs hankers my ability to sit on the ground; which on principle, and in practice, is akin to eating whole foods or not. Eating sugar begrudges my body, as does eating breakfast weigh me down; nor does the right blend of strenght, stability and restoratvie training treat me to anything more than adaqueate energy and form; while doing the latter brings a solid and tender pace throughout my day. "Where industry, love and time come to bear." 
            <br>&emsp;By my accounnts, the terms richness, splendor, wonder and felicity remark something somewhat broader, firmer and fresher than that of longing, craving, recklessness or elation. These are admittedly peaks which spring higher than the tops of those former; but so do they fall. And at that, such springs are not so constant, considering their nature as shining moments, rather than entire days. "And if so, but seldom, if not passing one offs." 
            <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is in a sort of contrast to the common fancies and wishes for comfort and fun; and at that, exotic delight and luster. As such, our course of action, so far as our means are concerned, is so for such ends. And like those who's means are for those funner ends, so do we have our own line to convene with. And as per all lines of oblige, so lies in it potential contrariety: which we will merely define as anything which brings you off the line. "For sin brings you away from the path to God; as does junk and fatigue bring me away from industry and recreation. While the case for comfort and fun, is such that being uneconomical whithers away the extent to which you can afford to enjoy such a state." 
            <br>&emsp;As it stands, I am an incomplete man. For I have the cares and quality which remark the deepest interests. Only, I have little form outside of this; and by the neccessity to exist in such a way, that the required amends make me anxious. It is not from the work demanded, but the association with other people. "For it seems that upon their work being done, that they go to the bar, or somewhere fun; and upon asking me, I have no recourse but to agree, or for some reason say know. I tend to just say no, and let life go on. And indeed existing this way is fine; as not all are in such cahoots; nor are we so aversr to all matters. But it is hard to enter a new enivronment, and only therein mingle; whereby you don't convene beyond that."
            <br>&emsp;Ultimtaely, what it comes down to is that I am tensely disposed to the goodness of a day, and at that our life. As one innately knows that college affords credit, and thus means to money, so do I, in what a good life seems to me, in being wide and plenty of rich and flourishing activity, know that what affords this is your health and care. For in one, you mould the furnace which burns the coals for all your active attention; and the other, faciliates the skill and familiarity to be both drawn and able within said tasks.
            <br>&emsp;We have learned that there are things beyond this. As food is but an adjacent element to our crafts, so are itineraries, trades and friendship equally around. And despite some of this being harder to find, and at that properly align, so are some accessible. Admittedly, they may require you to sit in a chair, or pay a small fee. But so is the worth of such things sufficeint. And at that, the value of such things is not comprasmied but the things itself. Eating out costs money; and although working for so much disposable income is not ideal, so is it permissible in its own right; but for 'eating out', so is this a fatiguing use of such means. By that, going to church or temple requires you to sit down, listen, communicate, and at that, be upright while public and social; but the ends are one whereby the instruments of such task are exercised, yielding us a little recovery from our private state. Plus, the advent of an occasion brings structure to your day; which irons out the neccessary appointments of work. As well, by exercsing those faculties, and being somewhat invovled, so do you hold more ground compared to other possible relations or scenarios; which brings more ease towards those, as you are not so eager or bashfull. "And thus, the cost being time, there holds no concern from me; while sitting, and at that begging the question of our principle, so may we be discrete, or confident as per the norm: which all in all, makes for a small price compared to the good received."

        <div id="comingaround">
            In our heart, we know a mistake has been made. For we left our home, our stbaility, maybe even a friend. Of that latter I hold no remorse, for how would I know; nor would it be but a vain experience amidst our attempt for truth. "And, admittedly, I saw little which remark much relation to to truth we then glemead."
            <br>&emsp;But now, having lived on for so long, all we've done is accumulate wellness to our living. Yet our position is such, that such living is held onto to much; and thus any return to stability is one that is all to apprehnesive. This is so though, for we are so ill-grounded outside our families offer and fortune. Yet, we know we must go; and thus, in leaving, we have left ourselve bare to such a return.
            <br>&emsp;For I never wish to do much more than the freedom given by my parent's provides. It is an odd scenario, as our simplicity and respect propagate our tenancy. But so is such a stay strictly limited. For my parents wish well for me, and at that, hold a fair discipline to our ultimate task of being ourself in a unprivate way.
            <br>&emsp;We are so private, for the procurring of such ways was done in contrast to the ordinary path; and at that, our cares and congruency fell short of the affairs of such path. And in that, we found a relative amount of joy, that being at home, 'as it was then esteemed', felt like the concillary action. But time went on, and we were asked for more; and perhaps fairly so. 
            <br>&emsp;I can't say whether the merrits of pushing me out there is well-based. But I can say, that in my heart, I at least know that it is not to our benefit or comfort to be as we are. And of such view, I accept it without concern, for of such matters which would better surround me, so are these not contrary to our dearer cares. 
            <br>&emsp;For the truth in the matter is that upon the cultivation of such cares, we disposed ourselves so heavily that obliging ourselves to dutiful affairs felt like a defecit; in both the toil and time. Now, our cares are not with much luster, but our harmony with such labors and their offer of autonomy and invovlment, is not but smooth and consistent. But as it were, we have come from a time, centered perhaps on the divergence from what our entire yuoth built towards; and thus, in all our ripe cultivation and awkward stubborness, we have cornered ourselve as to be so far out of outward connection, that finding any, be it demanded or sought, is so relatively stark, and thus a prompter for paranoi and reservation. "And as such, our contrivances run amuch, and at that over indulge in perfect scenarios, as to accomdaote our weariness."

            I want limber shoulders; those which don't bear down on me, nor lug unevenly. To accomplish this, I ought primarily do dowanrd and upward facing dog. I also seek a solid core, as to hilt my shoulders, and at that, be secure while seated. To do this, I ought remain active, along with doing leg raises and lunges.
            <br>&emsp;I seek good friends, but per interest. I play Diablo, Ark and some shooters; we'll play together. I do wish for a girlfirend, but only if I like her and she likes me. Our naieve optimism that our irrelevant merrit will procure some sort awe upon me is not right. Nor should we hope for something which is not realistic. "Our view on such things should not be but 'furgal' amidst a supposed exoticness." 
            <br>&emsp;At that, from work I find commradery with peers; along with some commune with distant associates and nearby customers. My name is Ryan, we love films, gaming, writing, youtube discoure on such things. I am seeking future professions as an online worker. Right now, I have helped my parents move, and am looking to work part time.
            <br>&emsp;The most important thing to me is flow. So I work shorter shifts, nearby, and nicely, while at home, in order to accumulate future rents; all while the meadows warm up, and the mountains afford nicer spots to see them. While doing so, our in between time is spent playing Diablo, Ark or Civ; all while we read at parks, having walked or ridden. We eat brussel sprouts, the freshest oranges, the greatest soups, and the fairest breads. 
            <br>&emsp;In life, I am obliged to regard the future with our likely family. As are such partners requiring of me to bloom with integrity; so that our true wisdom is not hidden or afraid. I fear no obscurity, nor does the world's path alarm me; nor are we ignorant on the tracks of it; the former motion being one of ultiamte and peacefull insight; the latter one of understanding, and at that humility to further understanding we lack, 'whereby the points of potential threat are being attended to in droves'. 
            <br>&emsp;I simply wish to express myself. And instead of doing so in the overt contrasts to responsibility, or dreaming like a child, or from bravado, I rather harness what good health and care brings us; whereby the work from our eyes and hands bring me to a rich and hearty cheer. This needs little possession. Instead, it requires the little which our provision is staked on. At that, those exotic and or hampered delights are overlooked as passions swirling from our unable means to an otherwise dear expression. And so I sit in such inability without dreams, but rather communcate, to those I depend on, or those who agree to exhanve work for provision, as to be stably thus, and therefore commenmurative to our aim.

            So two things are on my minde, namely that of work, and making friends/relations.
            <br>&emsp;For one, I think our need is quite tame, and at that, can settle on the point we care for. Let yourself be oriented, say hello to those who you were acquainted with; learn the names of those who your not. Remark your situation if it comes up; focus yourself, and at that situate yourself, by learning more about the various jobs. Find a way to talk about games, be it Cod or diablo, star wars, House of the dragon. And all in all, seek little which you at heart care not for, or are not right to, and be merrily cheerful, friendly, hard working and ethical. You can show up, say good morning, rest between the 2nd and third hour, then say that you are leaving. And honestly, my interest is such, as to faciliate our means of living; or at leas the comfort in doing so now. Also, having funds for our PC, future moves is appealling. As is the general free time amidst our stability to play Civ and scooter to the fields and read. We like ambient music because it makes me relax and into a flow; in particular, I like film scores or soundtracks; though, if I did like normal music, it would be soft rock, ie. chili peppers. I'm really into yoga, and eating heartily. I am not a vegan, but I tend to eat in such manner. Ask people their names, where their from, if their ready for the holidays, if their taking advantage of Black Friday, for VR, new computer, tv --considering how cheap they are. In total, the smooth pace of the holidays makes for a rather clean and comfy ambivolence; for bot our home and active life, mixed with work. "And to be fair, I never felt off while at that job, nor much while on Mariner. It was only so, when we yearned towards, and acted on our expectation of interest by another. I don't think so in any literal way, but I do consider whether such remarks by me made Holly, Nicole or Bailey feel like I'd harrassed them. If I did, I hope they'd forgive me, and know that I only meant it with a plain heart. And much of our forwardness was from our kind indifference, as to merely share that I felt that way. But we have learned that such feelings were not brought on because they, or me truly, liked them; but rather that I thought they did, and felt like I was oppertune to do so. Now it feels like, whether we need it or not, or at least if we can wait, that so is the question and at that interest, care, approach or regard for someone angled little on our heart fluttering or the apprhensive mystery of whether or not they share my feeling. For in truth, you should already know, for you have spoken to them, and they you. Try chatting, skyping, going for a walk or playing games. Just see if there's something for you to do. That is what a relationship should form around. And so a) if that core isn't there, then you need not pressure yourself, to make her feel uncomfortable, by being motivated and elated by mere repor, as to usher said relation; and b) if such thing isn't prescence, then let your hinderance or nerves come from an inner confusion, that there are such flutterings, but ill-placed considering your less than wholesome view (or intent); and thus, you need not linger or embrace, but be; and if that means you are not with another, so be it; better to be ourselves, free, ready and steady through acquaintence and familiarity, than fixate our impassioned breathe on some envied, begrieved, self assured and or ashamed feeling."
            <br>&emsp;That being said, I can see that spring holds a dream, whereby the woods and bees of Pitt Meadows open up, and mellow me into a cheery state. As such, less we are asked to quickly leave, then so may we stay for the warmer months. That being so, whether not we get the job now or later is not essential. I reckon that the holidays are a great way to meet people in an occupied state, and at that, build a point of friendly relations. I only seek part time, and thus, our meager ask (for Dev) need accordingly oblige. If that is not available, or the time isn't right, then we'll wait, and hopefully get hired prior to winter. So let's just phone, say that we've returned to Pitt and were looking to come back to PCX. Were a solid 80-90 uph ---with a bit of resharpening-- and that we wish to learn more about fill rates and 'department boons'. That, and while were there, ought we draw on such elements for our reflections --as we might do upon moving, or anything of the sort--- along with seeking proper conduct and ability within different tasks: notably the register and phone. "I just want to be more involved and able, as to feel more drawn and with care as to time and producitivity. And we have our own personal adendum, to speak clearly, ask and share about youtube, movies, tech, holidays and games. Ask even whether or not someone is from Pitt. Someone even who seem's another ethnicity, ask them where their from; and whether there is alot to be said, you can end with 'and do you like Canada, lower mainland, or Pitt Meadows'; for you can share your own feelings too."

            I am not a scientist in any meaningfull way. I may test my insights, but for now, I merely wish to cultivate the hyposethis which I'd then test.
            <br>&emsp;By that, what I seek are methods and or principles for inquiry. Namely, is that our mind is to be deemed as something analagous to the derived motions of planets; or that in life, that these are but motions of equally derived objects, but whose motions are best described by 'water dripping down snow, whereby the force of one propells it through certain trajectoriees by the friction of the substance'. Moreover, we have a Humian principle, whereby the recognition of our senses is but an equally derived thing; and just as the actual sense is but a union of finer motions, so is are regard a union of finer perceptions. 
            <br>&emsp;In that way, we can remove our mind as being some distinct object which the mystery of nature has produced. 
            <br>&emsp;From there, we can merely sit on the two main questions; namely that of esscence, in both substance and magnitute; along with distribution, as to see, how beyond an entities impetus, how it actually bore relation to others to create the complexities we see today. 
            <br>&emsp;This is better explained as a pairing of compliments, in both the inquiry needed to discern the base esscence; but then the science, and or investigation, as to see a) what are we anlaysising, ie, what is the form by some method made, and b) what is said form? 
            <br>&emsp;This latter portion is perhaps the truest question. For it is one thing to say, how did the planets come together: and you say through the sun's infant debris. But upon primordial unity, the question then reaches a basic form; as to how such unity is possible --or differentation at least as to procurr complexity within a soul, yet rippling fabric. 
            <br>&emsp;But such possibilty is not itself the question; at least, of that and how something complex came to be, so are these but the ontology and law, as to make results (or unity, as observed and descibred) able. Rather, the question, is of that ability through ontology, and to the laws we see --ie, the evident unities-- so are we looking at the means to the design of such ends. Or in other words, that unity could occur, why did it occur in the manner that it did? Why weren't other laws or unities created? Is it perhaps possible that the prescence of being at all is exlusively unique, and at that bound to the results we see? Could the results now seen been apart of a basis which would produce nothing else? Or better put, could be there be any basis which did not produce what we see? And at that, ought we consider whether there are many basis', if not potentially? 
            <br>&emsp;For the true test of a base theory, is not that any literary understanding of being is exlaimed, nor the deepest laws understood; but rather, one must understand how complexions made by the former and generalizes into the latter, came to be. For you are otherwise left with a fair idea of how being could be at all, but know causal effect as to the evidence we seek to explain. "And indeed, much confusion and contraiety lies in this isse: whereby you suppose the basis' conduct as to reach the evident end; or to work back from said evidence to reach either a)  a similar basis, but with with properties that are understood via analysis, or b) an understanding which is more akin to our causal view that cells are made of molecules which are made of atoms, which are bundles of particles bound by forces; and that these, may be composed of something equally definitive, but basic, or something deeper at least --of which may be made of something baser as well." 
            <br>&emsp;In fact, beyond the ostenstive principles we use to simplify the world we seek to explain, so may we use a crowned piece of evidence to better determine the 'grooved and or complex principle' we also seek to explain. Namely, that in the Cosmic Microwave background, you have distributions of 'lumops'; and that these are deemed to be the marks of anistropy in the universe; and at that, the points which would draw more matter (due to graviation), as to produce the massive clumps of matter which galaxies are. Alongside that, is the notion of dark matter, which is proposed to be the source of such anistropies, 'as if such points remarked dark matter wells, but which dissproportionate amounts of matter would fall into'. 
            <br>&emsp;Now, the question for all eternity, is why there is such non-uniformity? This indeed is why we remark that the baser esscence of things is not merely remarked by substance and motion, but magnitude, as to reflect the results which seem caused by a less than unifrom motion. At that, we can say that of the cause of CBM distributions, that these may be merely parts of a prior chain. But the question seemingly, be it inquired of in terms of baser magnitudes, or through analysis, as to see, how galaxies for instance are in fact in their wholeness, distributed by such CBM wells, is to how such anistropies were formed. And, foremost, to the form they took. For it is one thing to state that there are anistropies; just as there is fairness to say that the universe on the whole, seems homogenous. But of such homogenuity, so is it only so on a broad scale; where in fact, each element is where it is by a precise output of the function which causes non-uniformity. "For everything would be complete, soul, and at that featureless. Which in terms of the earliest things may be so; but so is everything we now see, in all its complexitites, a seeming result of some prior anisotropy. Meaning there was something which produced the features we now see."
            <br>&emsp;In short, the definitive principles regarding evidence make the investagtive principles approahcbale; for we need not regard any output as special. But said principles are not easy to declare; if only because we have too little to state regarding the cause of the particlar complexities, as opposed to there being complexity at all.

            All I seek is permission to express myself. My ignorance and adolescence barrs me from the sights and or resolve to public affairs. "But we are alike most peopple in that way." In any case, we prioritze our family and attendances; and derive a warm and stable liberty from there. "Or better put, such things direct my duties; to which our amends yields the treats of success." Again, we are perhaps privilaged to regard our 'deeds' as such, and not look to the affairs of others. "But such is the times; in that of our culture, it lacks broad reason."
            <br>&emsp;In this though, as the care for what is near and dear, so lies the battle to support oneself, while thwarting the 'customary' requests by others, to possess more than whats needed. And at that, the trouble to pronounce yourself, and by that find relations, via your interest in joy and active things: and not mere possession --or the active dreams which remark one's post towards the former, all the while there unpossessed state is drawn to things which promise some movement outside their idle station.
            <br>&emsp;In that, our own care for such principle is such, that finding stability is not so hard; if at all but the easiest amends to a slice of normal things. But thereby runs the frozen sentiment of our unacquiring progress; and the, albeit admittedly youthfull, feeling of being stuck in your stability, with no room to use it, 'nor any sight of developing it'. This is for me though, and indeed our growing years have shown little which is required that can't be mended to easily.
            <br>&emsp;But I think that our remarks here are bound by a sentiment of the past, whereby all these 'stable and or impassioned' matters, were measured up against the amount of princiuple good I could afford. And by that, I can see clearly that the last peg of such regard, lies in an understadning of the world; as if, upon our balance between deep and common pleasure, that so would the truth of the world commend the former. Even now, the balance is not much of a comrpamise, but an acceptence of remission from the passions built up till this point, and the practical trimmings of our excessive free time in order to secure that which is left, and nourish that deeper good

            So our localle is quite rich in plenty. It is not perfect though, like most locations.
            <br>&emsp;To begin, the 193 walk (north) is a run away hit, for it is so easy to take that path and come back up 192, or keep going to the park. At night, you can do the standard 193, or add to it naturally. You can also go south of 193, then turn around before you reach the round about. This road is not very busy; and everything is obscured by trees or backyards in this lower part. 
            <br>&emsp;Scattered all around are little routes to walk. At our intersection there are a set of townhomes which runs you to harris; and right there is a crosswalk to go to the rec center or town park. "Which is itself a fair place to sit and read." Besides that, you have Ford road, the back lane, or the curve at 193, each bridging Harris and 193. Further than that, lies the town hall area, the back road of the Coachmem and Hoffman park. There is a big loop from lower 193 and Blakely, with two long dead end streets on the latter. Going through the school is a bust during the day, though evenings and weekends you can add to 120 by looping through there, or going up Bonson.
            <br>&emsp;The main attraction though is scootering. In this regard, the town has welcomed me with renovated arms. From Pitt, you go down the stairs, and have a paved path which continues down the back of Pitt Athletic, coming out onto lower Airport way; or you can turn right, and take  the path to Harris. That airport path takes you to the long road, which has a stretch of dike which connects with the end of the airport; or you can turn back to go up the dike to Bonson's Landing --or take the forest route. The long road has a mid point which takes you through the woods to Harris, or brings you to Hammond or 119.  There is also a path which connects lower Hammond to the lower Airport way. And from there you can enter the Hammond region, or take Hammond road up to 203rd.
            <br>&emsp;We have learned that the moutains of the north are really the souther tips of the Pacific Range; and bordering those on the southeast portion of the Fraser Valley are the Cascades --with Mount Baker and Saint Helens layed prominently in the north. The Pacific Range holds all our familiar mountains within sub ranges. Cyprus, Grouse and Seymour are of the North Shore range, bordering the Gariboldi Range which Burker and Golden Ears are apart of --they are divided by Indian Arm. East of Golden Ears lies Stave Lake, which acts as a border between the Douglas Range; which extends to Harris Lake. From there, between Harris, lies the Lillolet range, which extends to the Fraser River, and all the way up to the eastern portion of Pemberton. 
            <br>&emsp;Looking Eastward, you have Golden Ears; the left point being the Golden Ear, the right being Edge Peak, and the little bump right of that being Blandshand Peak, or the needle. The valley between this holds Alouette lake, and to east side of the said valley is summited by Mount Crikmer. To the east of that lies Stave Lake and the border between the Gariboldi and Douglas Range. Also, from the meadows we live, there lies a small hill in the distance. This is Thornhill, and holds at its base SRT, Albion and 240th.
            <br>&emsp;The grand daddy of this thinking though, is to views. For clouds, the moon, color in general, finds its greatest strid over distance. And indeed we are privalaged to be near many bountiful spots. But as one who has many allergies cannot fully enjoy a menu, so does our limitation via terrain, or time of day even, lower the vantage points of interest. For we must see the North Shore Mountains, and those of the central range. Too, Mt Crimpken and Thornhill, being quite prominent to our eastern eye, are but the northern portion of the further ranges; namely that of Mt Sumas, Mt Baker, and the far off Cascades. 
            <br>&emsp;In that, there are many known spots which offer according views. Pitt Athletic offers a fairly detailed eastern view; and near the back of it, you get a fairly nice and rounded view of the northern mountains. It is almost entirely flat though, so sitting is limited. Near the foot of Airport road, sits a dike which runs to the Pitt river. Seeing as it is a dike, there is an inherent lip for you to sit on. And although the far West of the North Shore is harder to see, you get a very drawn back view of the eastern portion and all of the central range. I don't believe you get such a good view of the east; but even the east portion of the central range can be seen. In order to see Baker and the Cascades, you need to be either high up, or on the back of a western front. Ford Road is the main culprit, near the farm path. There are also northern portions that may offer isolated spaces as to see further east, or at least be closer to see the central portion. Up Ford  Road you can turn right onto Mctavish and go to a potential spot; or you can go a little up Harris and turn down a farm path --which is quite isolated if I remember. You may be able to see Baker, but I do not know. You can turn left on Old Dewdney onto Hale road, and sit by its own lip.

            One's remarks about things tends to be a little awry when they are of a vagabond type. For stability being what we seek, so may we relish the amount we have as given by those were housed by; but then upon leave, be in a relatively unstable place; as our vagrancy was not so much out of need, but choice. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, our principle of vagrancy comes by our principle of simplcity; so that our dependance does not merely satiate us, but bear means to flourish.
            <br>&emsp;What I've learned over the years is that dependance is not the means to such flourishing; but that having such a meager satiety has its advantage.
            <br>&emsp;Now, that we are more or less seeking a return to our own provisision, that so is our place in dependance one that is at a minmum beneficial, in that if we work as though we were providing, then we can accrue resources.
            <br>&emsp;In this though, I feel a little exposed; as if upon our plea to work, we feel entirely absent from anything of the sort. That, and there is still a perpendicular parallel from those we depend on, as regards the pressure for such provision, and at that, our leniancy for preference.
            <br>&emsp;For I don't admitt any shortcoming to our self made stability. I also have no qualms about recieving provisions; nor am I confused as to their periodic retreats. What I do remark though, is that each state holds a certain posture, and at that suitable conduct. While we are working, while being provided, then we are merely saving; and by that, so long as we are employed, than our promise should be sufficient for those housing us.

            It seems that pain is but a reoccuring event in our lives. Yet, in moments of pleasure, or spans at least, so do we forget; and at that, priotizie such pleasures and the expense of future pain.
            <br>&emsp;There is a lesson though, namely in your constitution as a being; and by that, akin to your forgoing air for comfort, that so will the latter have no vessel to please while the former is absent.
            <br>&emsp;By that, I can say that remarking our learned and or forseen troubles is the right thing to do. "For those we care for will at best be subject to our own experiences, having shown up unprepared; and that is even if we can handle such affairs when they do occur, and at that, develop any sight or understanding to pass on."
            <br>&emsp;In this case, the point is one of sincere admission and remarks; for the inevitable hurdle will thwart any current and coming good. 
            <br>&emsp;The moral of this though, is not that dredd should be our proper response: as if the neccessary challenges ahead warranted such. Instead, as we would break iron to reach gold, consider your abilities spent on things of such neccessity. And from there, earn the stability to be, as though you were unburdened. For it is one thing to forgo breathing, and by that, cease to live; and another, to oblige the requisites for home and bread; but thereby, over time, develop the character and composure as to accomdate stresses, appreciate what's nice; and at that, lower the actual weight of the incoming trouble, via wisdom and skill, and otherwise raising the good you receive, via commisery and time's fortune.
            <br>&emsp;To note then, we have learned that the ultimate requirment of satiety, is one that ought be truly adhered to. For this indeed is the poster child for, 'I am fine now, and oh well, we'll deal with that later'. So that even in stable positions, we abandon them for pleasure; but then upon our encumbant return, so are we with little, and at that, forced to reorient ourselves; which drags down any current pleasure, and at that, invivtes much pain from the novel prescence of responsibility. "Life is like a spearhead, and one ought always be in line with the thrust of it; for never in their privalage will they hold so forever; nor, in their fortunes, will time offer much or demand less. For the joy in things still comes down to your engagement with things; which is not something which fortune especially faciliates. In fact, it seems our fortunes are sought due to their clearing of pain, as oppposed to the freedom they provuide for pleasure to be gained. And when we consider what such aim requires, we realize that it is not but clarity and commission; which is something that fortune merely orients from stable grounds. But only so you can fully be."

            The world's complexion is such that, of its various canders and hues, so do they return to the points once been, and by that, blend with any subsquent or prior points: which indeed, makes for much warmth in the coldest days, 'as you know that change is coming'.
            <br>&emsp;This creates a sentiment of indifference regarding our itineraries. For our life indeed will grow and end by the summer's day; but ought this be remarked upon by the elements of such course: leaving year ends and quarterlies for buisnesses.
            <br>&emsp;In this sense, we can look at the time of our lives as being bare, or blossomed; and at that, warm, hot, cold and Icy. And marbling that are the clouds; and they may be dry, puffy or overcast. 
            <br>&emsp;For the world is not homogenous, in that as you go from top to bottom, so do the arrangments of said factors change. There is a sort of mirror considering opposites in terms of relative southern and northern distances from the equator. But all in all, one really ought assess their local pattern.
            <br>&emsp;Far east of us lies a great flat. And between us and it is a line of mountains, namely the coastal, columbia and cascade. In our little neck of the woods, we sit between the coastal-cascade knot, whereby one has come from the north to meet the tip of the one who's come from the south. In that exchange, lies the Fraser Valley; named by the prominent river which runs from the eastern side of the northern ranges, in between that coastal-cascade exchange. The land is generally flat, though there are some hills, if not minor mounts and plateaus; such as the strip between central Vancouver and Burnaby. The foliage is a mix of leafy and confier trees; along with surrounding areas of farmland and fields --some of which are either public, or lined by public trails. And flanking the western side, is the ocean, and all its wafting salted smell. Due north lies the head of the Coastal mountains. These come southwest into the Northshore, due south into Garibaldi, slighly more east into the Douglas range, and fairly southeast inot Lilloete. "While Mount Baker lines the northern tip of the cascades."
            <br>&emsp;As for the warmth and hues, we ought remark the solstics and equinoxes per our hemisphere. For all I know, the winter solstice for those in the south, is when ours hits summer. At any rate, from the winter solstice, the land is completely bare, as is there a fair amount of overcast and rain. There are some clear moments, with clouds and open skies; but besides the propensity for purple hued dusks, the land is essentially devoid of color. There is mind you, a vibrant effect by light, as such blankeness takes it all in. As are the morning moors crisp in their paleness, and at that tinted with a icy blue. As the Spring equinox is approached, the land begins to blossom and warm up. There is rain, but it is not as often, nor persistent when it occurs. And by that, there comes a medley of clouds; be it souly on days wihotu rain, or in the evenings when the rain has lapsed. To note, the early approach to spring is still cold, and does not get warm till the equinox happens. Upon that though, the land reaches full blossom, and begins to settle into a consistent heat. And as such, the evenings open up for sitting. As the solstice is met, the ground is dry, and the clouds are thinned out. They remain somewhat puffy, but it is more of a dry streak across the sky. And from here till the fall approach, the air is stuffy and hot. But as that ceases and the late equinox arrives, so is there a coolness which mixes with the lingering heat. And albeit light in rain, there begins to occrue great clouds in the sky. And alas the lushness nears its end, so do the colors of it all change, and at that, offer us a lenghty fairwell, as the land then becomes more bare, cold and wet; upon which the ice resumes and the sky-coverage sets in. But for a mere time though, as the ice eventually wains, as do the rains reign their excess in. And by that moments end, the puff of all that coverage lines the common points of our day; and in that, marbles the sprouting flowers and leaves. And through warmth and heat we're sent.

        <div id="soughtends">
            Needs are what, upon absence, bring us to cease.
            <br>&emsp;There are means to such needs, both in ability and substance; by which our need is comparable, in that we must exhibit the motion of breathing amidst the prescence of air. The latter is the purpose though. And in terms of what we are, as to have needs, so is it that which ceases upon the abscence of that which we are porported to. "For such thing is given the titled purpose, in that it is the thing which we require."
            <br>&emsp;Along these lines then, we can consider that air, nutrients, water and warmth are what our efforts are aimed at. 
            <br>&emsp;In this though, we come to remark the factors which give life to the according means. For if we need food, then our capability is so, that it is persisent so lnng as it can sustain the body which therein substaniates the prescence of said capability. "Like a system which provides for itself; and by the systems needs, so do such appartus behave like an appartus which is given its own being by virute of being an extension of the thing which it satiates." 
            <br>&emsp;In that, we can look at our needs and means, and say that such means have their own requisites. In htat, for food we need locomation, and by that dexterity. While the means for warmth may be found throug shelter; but we thereby need the means for resourceufllness and design. Nor is the appartus for scooping water sufficeint without the sense to find it. 
            <br>&emsp;History lays it's basic claim here, in that, by our resolve to satsify our hunger, we developed such greater means to do so that excessive efforts could be attended. And by that, economy grew, per the exchange of novel goods. And from that, so did those baser productions of food get incorpoarted inot the economy; making them goods which were neccessary, amongst goods which were novel. Only, because folk's partcipation was based on their input into the labor required to extract such goods, so were inefficneis there consquential for those who'd otherwise be subject to their own local shortcomings. For the food-system was one that spanned the country, and by that, failed those at all ends of its borders. "This contrasted the local ventures, whereby those within a clan, or a village, lived and died by their own local capacity."
            <br>&emsp;As a result, the means to satiety were found by efforts prompted by novel exchange. And through currency, folks were compensated by those whose motivation for such currency, as to offer goods in exchange for it, was so as to also offer such currency to those who aided them in producing said goods. And the moderation of such venture was merely in the proportions, so that a profit could be made. 
            <br>&emsp;Of note then, is that as such motives were based on the prospects of exchange, the fact of risk and investment into such a venture made it so that those with such motives would share in the capitol required, and then split the rewards. And although the early stages of this saw a mixture of indivudals and groups making such attempts, so did the higher stages see broader cooperation, and by that further inputs to the requisite capital. Or better said, that be it initially, where the greatest risk and potential lay, to the matured moments whereby further progress could made, and at that benefit from the capitol to do so, that so things lay.
            <br>&emsp;Through the advent of industry, the means for those with such motives was enabled, and by that, the output of goods increased, and also the potential for those seeking compensation for their contributions. Wages mark the labored efforts of the former, while equity marks the capitol and or stocked investments, and by that potential return, of the latter.
            <br>&emsp;In that, the economy is akin to goverment, in that each are a kind of soceital mode. And by that, the promise of the latter is in organization of the groups capacity, and at that, regulation of the conduct of those invovled. The advent of the former aspect is that through the excess' born by industry, that so can valued goods and producive labor be offered, and by that, quality of living and common wealth. 
            <br>&emsp;The downside, is that of that latter, that so is it banked on the availability of the required goods, and at that, the capacity for those in need to hold currency. 
            <br>&emsp;In this though, by perpetual attempts, one is subject to their according capacity; and at that, hurt upon failure. While the stability from production is one that is limited by one's work elsewhere, and it's fiat offerings as to purchase said products. 
            <br>&emsp;But in this,  I would say, that the matter of stability, and the broader notion of freedom, is such that be it through hunting or gathering, or an economoy of any varied sort, that these are merely means to such settled ends. Indeed we may remark how we are in the mode of soceity were in; but for the same kind of gain. "For what is novel and basic does not change in a value'd sense. The only difference is in the ease and consistency by which said things are acquired."
        </div>
        <div id="meansmode">
            So we need food. And our choice is either to gather it, or exchange cash for it. The former is limited by our abilities and permitt; while the latter is a mark efficeicny within the culture which would produce such goods to begin with, and at that the posiitions of labor as to award me the currency to purchase.
            <br>&emsp;The principle though, is that one who gets what they need, is done so through a veil that is equal regardless of mode. Those being one of gathering or exchange. And it is important to rememeber, that with the change of society being long and gradual, that all who you are acquainted with, be it family, friends, offspring, romance and peers -past or present- that so will they be of the current mode. And by that, we are all part of this collective economoy, as we were of collective forgaing.
            <br>&emsp;And so when I think of our progenitors, I see that they will be apart of an economy, and by that, be subject to the labor required, and cost of goods. As may there fortunes sway by output of such goods.
            <br>&emsp;Our remark though of the economical mode, is one that clearly varies in complexion. For the Greeks held an equal kind of economy as we in the modern world. Yet, the character of all our elements differ then them; particulary in the richness of our own.
            <br>&emsp;By that, the moment we give up on our aversion to the 'neccessary' principle, is one where we are left to see what life is in respects to that.  
            <br>&emsp;For pain, and by that token the hunger for one's need, is something which will always run paramount. "For our state amidst such a way, whereby a need is not met, is one which ceases our ability to be otherwise pleased. As our needs are such that they are, or rightly remarked at least, by the satiety of things which allow us to be. In living at least."
            <br>&emsp;For life is in many ways a mere stripe in nature's canvas. Beyond the tiny details, there lies an esscence which is merely trying to proceed. And as enzymes bear us certain gifts, and oxygen the means for energy in our cells, so do the abscences of these merely alter the form of such esscence; whereby the state we'd call living, whereby the relation with nature is such as to exhibit such living form, that so is an alteration of this but a different orientation of such esscence, as to upon its cease, be what we'd call death, or a transition into the rest of nature's flow. For life is an assembly; in that the traits we remark as being inherent to living, are but the expressions of an ordered assembly. While death is but a dissassembly, whereby those traits are no longer exhibited; and as it were, the portions once assembled drift off into the winds and currents.
            <br>&emsp;In all of this then, you have two sides of things. One, is the state your in, your condition. While the other, remarks the motions of your time and attention. The former might describe a moment of peace, in that by your actions, such was your result; while the latter remarks your will, your patience, your oblige; by which your esscence, as assembled and exhibited amidsts the rest of nature, yields a sort of state in such assembly. 
            <br>&emsp;Virtue is indeed the term used to describe actions (from one to nature) that yield the subject a fair response. Namely, if all ends, in composition that is, were coneyed as either peace or despair, then virute would be that which, considering the subjects assembly, and that of nature around, that so the relation of the two brought that favorable end; and equally to the averse end, does vice lay. "My actions are of virtue or vice according to the result they give me. I may move in the same way for one or the other; but it is in truth, that per our relation with nature, that the motion I made would be evaluated as having been of virtue or vice, upon the result it gave me. Virtue and Vice then are judgements, in that we reflect upon the result of our actions."
            <br>&emsp;It is to often overlooked that, in our assessments, that it is not enough to simply know the properties of our actions, but that of the qualities we seek. For it is one thing to say that an action was such, whereby we remarked what we did; and it is likely fair that the point we reached is also simple to describe. But as to what was dealt to us, in terms of our actual condition, so must that be remarked upon. For it is easy to say that I did such and such, and as a result, this thing happened. But this is not what virtue is measured by, but rather how such results impacted you. "Were you left in peace or despair? And, perhaps rightly so, were you, in the former even, moral?"
            <br>&emsp;For that is soul the question ultimately. Not so much that we'd understand peace as to be able to remark what dealt us so; but that, in seeing what did, that our effective choice did not cause pain to another. 
            <br>&emsp;Oddly though, it would seem that as I remark the yield of my results, that so would my moderation against others be measured by what they, upon reflection, saw as good in their own yields. 
            <br>&emsp;At this point, we have some basic properties to our neccessary principle. For man is not merely pleased when he earns his share. Rather, he works with others as to bear an excess which feeds all. He doesn't do this out of generosity, but requirment. For it is not in his nature to satiate himself alone. Not that he wouldn't be pleased if he could; rather, by his self, he is not able. At least, being consistent and sufficeint is difficult to do.
            <br>&emsp;And so by being collective, he is exhibiting a trait, or acting in a certain way, of communcation, aggreement and harmony, for ends which please him. 
            <br>&emsp;And I cannot entirely say whether morals are such, that by his pleasure in collective harmony, that he is admitting his own good alongside the admittence of other's goods. Or, if his virtue is merely one of an effective trait, in that by being collective, he finds what he needs. For in that, he is acting in a certain way as to satisfy the requirments in working together; the effect being one of finer production.
            <br>&emsp;For the concern then, is that morals seem more like something you owe somebody, while principle remarks what is wise for someone to do. And the truth in things, albeit hard to ever know, merely forrays as to what will lead to results worth acting for. While morals seem to enstate what is otherwise a given by the prescence of principle. But perhaps, the obligation in place, is there to counteract any lack of principle

        <div id="thelineofexchange">
            In all, the complete inquiry of things regards the means for differentiation. Yet, it is oh so hard to show where the slight differences began; and where the aparent complexions are but compositions of such.
            <br>&emsp;For I do not know if we have a soul, or if our mind is tapping into something, or recieving at that. But so much as we are fair to suspend our assessment, so may we say, that in all entirety, so is there the baser question of being, by which all other things are judged by.
            <br>&emsp;The question then of morals, right and wrong, sin and virtue, is not much more than a feature within nature, or at least a statement regarding what we presume nature to be. For the latter, I'd say that evidence holds the soul merrit. While the former, marks a sort of challenge, in that we are at best exploring the possibilities. It is worth noting that both sides tend to converge, in that what we deem nature to be, is both inspired, and at that confirmed by, evidence which we deem laudible by its relation to such truths we see. In that, miracles lie, and all things of intervetion or thought.
            <br>&emsp;I would say though, that the basis of nature, and of a sort which is not to beholden to antiqauted concepts, is such as to be rightly tempid; as neither our physical understanding of the world is complete, and at that fully handled, for us to make any precident claims: as the ends are unknown. Nor, in the evidence that we use to conjure causes, and by that, bear a sort of 'neccessity' to our sentiments, as if such maxims must be in order to produce what we mean to explain, that so in this are we quite ill-formed in any logic or philosophy which is, explcitily, born of evidence and concepts of a modern sort; nor, in my view at least, is there much richness within such inquiry, as would remark modern sentiments brought through our liberal ways. For the past did not allow for much exploration beyond the norms. And now even, considering the baser facts established, so has there been little inquiry from that point. And by my account, attempts at such highlight what facts are not understood, or ar absent to our personal understanding. But foremost, is that in those inquiries there lies a depth which goes further down then our physical understadning can support; nor are there the right terms as correspond with such understanding, as to appropriaptely concieve of the realm of such depths; as the colors and hues of such abyss are not naturally exposed to our definite senses; or at least the state of such senses is not developed enough. But beyond the promise of our path, and where such progress can lead us, I can say, that in the realm beneath there lies what can only be described as dark, awkwardly proportioned, and at that, unsure. 
            <br>&emsp;Our deepest belief though, as if a soul spike in our inquistive ground, is that although we cannot be much more than skeptical of the truth in things, that we can say that the mystery lies not in proving that there is someting which there is a basis for. For in our apparent being, there lies a evident and concieved conposition, all  of which is sewn from simplicity. And the point is not so much to speak of the result of such weaving, but rather that such weaving occured, and by that, there must be fibres and strands to do so. "For even in our barest reduction of all things complex, there is still no supposed blankedness; or absolute unity at least, whereby uniformity and fullness is explicitly so."
            <br>&emsp;In other words, albeit immesurably simple compared to the complexity we see, so is the truth of such composition possessed of character, and by that edges, traits, grooves. For without it, it is hard to see how there would be anything but the smoothest complexion. Yet, in the earliest evidence of things, there lies the grooves of dark matter holes. "So we ought clarify the edge by which objects are basically deemed; and how the depths by which said basis, be it seperate to said objects, or a mere darker spot to their own definition, can be better illustrated and explained." For it is not a meager task to describe nothing. Yet, with a bright eye and literary fidelity, the attempt is not so hard. For our mere idea of nothing, and the presumed difficulty in describinbg, is so, as to hold inherent traits which we assume within it; and such properties are in need of a steady hand to reckon such.

        <div id="cleanerror">
            At heart, I am not concerned about our place right now. For as remarks our happiness, we are free. 
            <br>&emsp;But life goes on, and as we know that we will not be a vagrant forever, so do I see that we will not be by ourselves forever. Nor will we be absent from the world. 
            <br>&emsp;Yet these things are all so far away. And in many ways, the heart of our suspense in vagrancy; for those other things are built on the requisite of us being non-vagrant; by which there is none who hold much above me.
            <br>&emsp;What is odd, is that if I consider our forutnes, be it from time, the lands, or family, I still see that what I deem as promsiing from that, there is little to do with those supposed ends of our future. If we receive money, we are not thinking of its relevance to relations or family, but travel and leisure.
            <br>&emsp;In that way, having the former is akin to buying a home, in that a down payment is required along with means to pay the mortage: meaning that it is but a matter of meeting the requirments, and earning the reward. Perhaps our confusion lies in the less than prevalent concern for providing for our family, but rather raising them, and at that, moulding them as not to be subject to, and at that  personally reach fortune, but to actually live, and by that do so to their family. 
            <br>&emsp;Yet, we are left in all of this a sort of complacent to such interest. For I could almost care little for it to be.
            <br>&emsp;One thought is that what we care for so much, at least what satisfies us enough not to seek such goods from family, is that our interests lie within blend of disregard and or unexposure to duty. For we are not required to have children or family; nor are we so discouraged. We in fact are at most subject to scrutiny over our personal dependance; yet such a situation only occurs because we find so much relief in having our meager needs met; whereby we have not oblige which bolts us to the ground. Admittedly I have been poor in making friends, and otherwise been too lavish in the one's we did make, and also foolish in our romantic attempts. And so the lacking of other's who bring security and strenght to your life is in part why you struggle to see much promsie in  novelty; and at that, much care for accessory goods from labor.
            <br>&emsp;In many ways my life is such, that it has never been but a coming or steady going to flourishing. All squelching delights have vanished; nor have the impassioned flames of our heart been tended for any blazing moment. Instead, we have that feeling you get after exercise, or success in some work or task; where we breathe nicely and with ease. 
            <br>&emsp;Pleasure is very hard to state. For sex is clearly a marvel,  as are trips and promotions surreal. And I don't mean to simplify them as mere moments. But we can say that the form of life is such, that of its entire canvas there are many spots; and such elations brighten spots of it; but do not strictly color any other. The fair admission is that, of those spots elsewhere, that the actions which effect those may be so as to enrich them, or make them pleasant, by the glowing effect from those brighter spots. But wisdom doth profess that the actions required to brighten the rest of the canvas does not come purely on the elation of those particular points; for the right choice need be elected, from the glee of those other pleasantries. "Ones' moments of pleasure bring a sort of well of cheer and intent, as to feel more free and open to do the right things. But beyond the effect of those points, in terms of pleasure, so  are the accompanying effects which they inspire unaltered by those sources of inspiration; such sources are but mitigators as to bring an action to fruition: but the end of such action remain in line with the action which brought it: and thus, and influence to do usch action is but a motivation for another cause and effect. And wisdom fairly suggests that the orientation of our selves, from reason, is both usefull and required for cause and effects of a good kind to be the one's motivated. For a thief who was brought to glee, is only then happier to do his thieving."
            <br>&emsp;Where we lie then, albeit obscure in quality, is of an end which has come by the leniance of tradition, and our otherwise forray away from its lingering threads.  For we were not damned to not have relations or strict family lines. But we were ushered to a profession; if only out of the potential benefit, or the concern of the family we some day had. But in this, I sought not such benefits; nor were such ends but far off remarks. And by that, our later youth held not but a retreat from the duties proposed, if only because their labors and chastisment was without promise. Not till the blankedness of our consqeunt state began to fledge, did we take any part in forming ourselves to what did interest us. For in some baser way, the strenght one finds in being skilled and able, or of prowess, is such as to be pleasing; in a comprable way to settled peace, but of a confident and by that reasuring sort. And as it occured, in our lapse from the affairs of romance and profession, so did our self regard (and according practice) produce a hankering for such prowess. "And indeed, for some time, upon our bareness within the abscence of duty, did we vehmently take to those self-committments." For such efforts were in themselves pleasing, and at that very rewarding in their honor and fortitude. Moreover, did they lead to an appreciaton of things, as perhaps remarked our more youthfull interests. 
            <br>&emsp;I think, that as histroy goes, that the depth of it all lies in the propogation of the species. For it is odd for someone to disregard that; or at least, considering theire nature to care for the elements which lead to such, that they'd not oblige themselves to so, or expect such things to happen. "As if compared to our expected breathe a moment from now, that family was but a gasp that we saw years ahead."
            <br>&emsp;In this sense, I am wondering how the notion of happiness comes to be. For it seems a weird, and almost exlucisviely modern concept, in the way that governemtns operate in ways that are leagues away from our own attention. There are so many people as it is, and what one person does fails to faulter the whole of the species. Yet the sentiment of rignt and wrong, and what is othewise wise or foolish, cannot be fully stated.

            For simplicity sake, we'll say there are two kinds of jobs: flexible and immobile.
            <br>&emsp;For the latter, there is the concern of being stationary, and at that powerless to heed your passions for yonder. There is also the risk of coming and going, as such jobs are about employment, as opposed to gigs.
            <br>&emsp;Flexible jobs have no inherent value; at least, the passion which a stationary job can curry is not absent from flexible jobs; they can merely respond better. Amd truly, coming and going is a novel pleasure, and can cease any staleness or depression in life. "The ability at least is calming." But the requisites for such jobs is in a skill that can be flexibly employed. As such, one must train to do so; which is not itself a drawback from the provision it provides. But, the actual use of it must be sufficient as to maintain said skill; so that the flexibility it is merrited on can be satiated by the quality of the ability. But on top of that, you must also submitt yourself to the employment. Which indeed may lower as time goes on, as the rewards of your application become richer. But so are we past the neccessary training, and into the progress through employment; whereby you grow in skill and fortitude through the demonstration of your novice means; to a point where such means become more promsiing, in that you can do more lucrative tasks; and by their richness, less of them. In other words, one must invest in the training required, but with a fair sense as to the use of such development for employment and further growth. For such a path is one that is in esscence fruitful; but by that, there is also committment and lasting expression of said skill; and one may not wish to dedicate themselves to that. Or, better yet, the novice years of said skill and their sterner needs, may not be so enticing. "For any path of this sort will lead to a state which is satiates you through little effort; but only so because you can do jobs that award satiety through meager effort: all the while your means to do so have developed to do so. For you are otherwise settled in the prospects which your novice skills can engage with." And beyond the actual good from the work, the purpose of it in being provisional holds the flexible quality of such tasks under the measure of consistency. For in being flexible, we must be able to employ ourselves with equal motion. And indeed, experience does increase your means to find such oppertunities where you go; or you may not leave your prospects due to online. "It is just simply the case, that these kinds of jobs are hard to cultivate with the meagerest amount of effort. For your promise never solidifes."
        </div>
        <div id="fullaim">
            There seems regards for what I care for, and those which remark others. Friendship and romance are not limited by the simple ways of the former. But the subjects of the latter are not satisfied by the extent of such simplicity. I can remark that our vagrant stake is not a stable condition for our own interests. But the care for family is not a remark of that,  but one of future equity. 
            <br>&emsp;For I don't wish to work from home for the sake of me. The work is either monotonous or consuming. And maturely, I see that our care to go where the perks of flexibility take me, are not substantial when you consider the good that your simpler stability offers. "I seek not that which more specialized efforts provide."
            <br>&emsp;I lie then with a notion that our fortunes are such as to be sought so that we can merrily proceed and figure things out. But as the pressure to figure them out not feels so prominent, I see that very little of what I concieve as happening, will not occur naturally. Nor is a gradual prescence of your being a sufficeint state as to procurr such ends. Such a state may incorporate you into the world in ways that faciliate the requisites for such ends. But such an effect is merely the result of you being more stable, and at that comfortable in being broadly drawn, or positively hopefull and receptive to things you concieve. That may occur, in that you station in the world will compell you to more things; and at that, color them with worth, to which your oblige isn't one of insecure conjurings, but sincere want: of which you happily proceed, and earn the perks of having done so. 
            <br>&emsp;Again, this suggests that if we are working and happy, that friends will come our way, as will romance. And considering we have so many interests and cares, that the whims of these, ie. in podcasts, writing, things of posterous glory, will feed off of our confidence from such happiness, and thus treat us to the goods from those things we love.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed this sentiment holds some truth. As our lack of friends or romance, in a baser way, is a factor as to why we feel to reserved in our pleasure, and at that, without enough pleasure or ease to feel peace in  our station --whereby those wants from flexibility occur.
            <br>&emsp;In that, I am not so accepting of this personal stake in things;  whereby we otherwise ignore the requirments for children. But I do see in this, that there are two paths; one being of hope from our adventures and promise; the other being from our current pressures and unsure state, whereby we anxisouly see and dream of sufficeint scenarios (to meet those familial provisions) that are in themselves pleasing. "Whereby we held a stable scenario, which was pleasing in the obligate part." 
            <br>&emsp;The first scenario feels like the hopefull one. And I can say, that if we iron out all the lingering fear and gloopy assurance, we are  left with the tender and kind stability; in that the fruits from the more humane want of romance and friends, is such that the gradual growth and acquaintence with the world from there, is as humble and oppertune as those things we seek. "Whereas behing the hot one in town, and earning the according cred, is an aligned excess."

        <div id="coldbloom">
            What is the best time to move? Well the cycle is such, considering our latitudnal constant, that it will more or less repeat in a timely manner. It is not irrelevant that you'd enter a new place on the foot of spring, or the exit of summer; but that you would feel the effects of missing one over the other, is not very mucb more than the minor experience of going through the stretch you choose. "And in accounting for our life, I can see, that through growth and maturity, that time becomes easier to sink into, and by that, let it whisp by." 
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, I can say that the foot of spring is such,  that the coming months are warm, full of clouds, leaves and birds singing; nor do the mornings peak early, or the sun setting so late. Though, once said foot has settled, the land becomes dry, hot, thin in the attire and full of haze; and the days are longer, which brings on much excess of leisure; though the late skies are nice to see, and free to do so. "And our age is such that experiencing the mornings is tough; but our bend is towards that." 
            <br>&emsp;Te exit of summer is similar to spring, in that the land lush, warm and full of clouds. But the rains do begin, and as the entrence to winter is met, so do they come often. The cool airs are nothing to be averse to, nor are the leaves falling but a final welcome. But things do become bare, and eventually frigid; eventually pitching to a freezing cold. 
            <br>&emsp;Case in point though, as time goes, that so as the heart of winter sets in, do you reach a point where it is exited, and the foot of spring is on the horizon. In late January this occurs, as the rains become less severe; or at least less daunting as the winds and temperature don't mix them into a freezing tempest. And despite the lack of pleasure from the sleeping forest, there is more room to go outside and see the skie, and otherwise rest. For the sun rises earlier, and sets latter, and all the harshness of the winter ceases. The good to come has not yet occured, but there is still much which is naturally present. And by my accounts, if life were like that forever, there'd be little to complain about. 
        </div>
        <div id="yettoknow">
            So I have no celebreatory remarks, merely those which reflect the heart of our path.
            <br>&emsp;For our mom and dad pressure me for the right reasons. As pain, being the grand exhibitor, is not something that a mometns pleasure should be put of for. As we've learned, the nature of things continuously comes knocking on our day; or eventurally at least. Ansd whether such things are fairly known by those who'd implore me, so are they right in their sense that occurences of any sort will occur.
            <br>&emsp;From that, I can see that our want of family is a final plea for us to be responsible. By that, our need as to faciliate that is the extent of our quest; concerning duties. 
            <br>&emsp;From this, I can say that of such quest, we've marbled the end, the right in our means. But we've got a somewhat open hollow between such ends. For we are not so stable right now as to be able to pursue such things; but as our want excites. 
            <br>&emsp;All in all, I see how our course in life is such, that for pleasures which are fair and hearty, to those which are broader and demanding, that so of the path we are on. 
            <br>&emsp;But I cannot say that our strides are full, or firm at that. We've seen much, and at that learned all but little. But our currennt place is not much as to reflect that; but rather a precipce to action which remarks what we've learned.
            <br>&emsp;Our ignorance is not so prevalent, but our knowledge of things is not complete. From that, I know not which means would be best for those final pursuits. I have a sense of the qualities which would bear sufficiency and preference; but of what would fit such a bill, I am yet to know.
        </div>
        <div id="aplacetosee">
            So our aim is such, that to return to a point in which I'll have to leave, is both unpleasing and contrary to basic future goods. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, we will have to continue working. And indeed, there being a state of this which has a balance of preference and ease, can form over time. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, I prefer efforts which are robust, as opposed to laborous or monotnous. This is why personal shopping is great; as your always moving, but lightly. Cooperation also plays a factor, as you build peers, and otherwise soften your days.
            <br>&emsp;Another important factor is that ordinary jobs are stationary, in that you commit to the position their in. But if you stay long enough, you may transfer. At least, leaaving a job with the confidence that a new one will be found, is not only unnerving, but also a little deterimental; as you loose your credibility and stake. "At least it seems like something which you'd be better to hide; that you'd come and gone to so many jobs."
            <br>&emsp;Now, there is the richer matter of wage and quality. The former comes through higher kinds of jobs, or specilized ones. While the latter remarks the form, namely in that you'd work remoetly. You may also do something meaningfull, and by that warrant your station. 
            <br>&emsp;In the simplest terms, these kinds of jobs are either steeped in requirment, or monotnous. There may be some which are not, and our resourecfullness will tell. 
            <br>&emsp;But an important remark, is that whether you must look and at that heed, or see and work towards, that you must be in such a place as to rightfully see the end you seek, and be drawn by it to go through the requisites; or, even in simplicity, you ought be able to apply yourself for such things. Better yet, that doing what is less comfortable for the sake of more money or flexibility, is a mark of your stature, in that you are not so sensitive to richer yet harder things. These sentiments have to do with the gradations from stability. In that, if you are secure, in that your needs are truly met, and that of such security there is space around via the advents of leisure and friends, then your skin will become thicker, your confidence more malleable, nor your dreams so depraiving, 'as you otherwise feel distant from a point which contrasts the lesser one your in: the one of which draws such far horizon'. 
        </div>
        <div id="destined">
            There is this sentiment which I have sought to explain; and I think I can.
            <br>&emsp;It goes simply, that our work is meant to seep provision. And per recent insights, such provision is not based on what we need now, but a family ahead. Indeed, the state of our development may be so, as to remark our progress along such means; in that we were at a certain point to faciliate an according measure of want; nor were we lacking headway to grounds ahead which would faciliate more. "And our principle is such, that such ends ought be destined for the provision of family: for not much else is required but what the world asks for you in integrity, or the world in your opinion. And such means are in abundance now: and merrley flat because of our construction of it, rather than a lack of tools."
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, this future sentiment is atop the finer grounds of personal interest; whereby the means for such are as simple to faciliate our creative whims and expression. Such needs are but what satiates our stomach and rest: and thus the income for the according food and bed. 
            <br>&emsp;In that though, the truth is that such affairs are not in themselves promising for those future ends. Nor are they at all sufficeint in their current state.
            <br>&emsp;And the sentiment I mean to explain, is that so much as I don't care for that future end, that being dependant or not in terms of personal stability, differs only in the constancy of such stability. As those who you depend on, family namely, are not so lasting in their vagrant support; for they wish well for you in those final demands. 
            <br>&emsp;It seems that our interests are free for expression when we are the ones providing. But in that, we are merely at liberty to be on route or not for such final ends. "And your family is not going to otherwise let you fail. All the while, your effort to support yourself, is free to do so in vain."

            So consider this line of thought: Plutarch, as a dutiful man, who writes and smelters for his own pleasure and place, compared with the likes of Descartes and Hume, who seek much from their inquiry, as they doubt the declerations ahead, but in that, find no pleasure in merely thinking, but knowing; and by that, they seek praise and applause, as to warrant their quest, but are in effect worn thin.
            <br>&emsp;In regards to Plutarch, I see his free time like a garden, in that he means not to sell the fruits, or earn acclaim; he might, and considering his novel attention, so may the expression of such as grown from his stability offer him some breadth; yet he does not care if he faulters, nor does he yearn to be heard, or finsihed, for in his duty he's already won; and in that, he is both calm in his wonder, and unsubjedted to the hopes of infamy; nor the associated fear of disdain. "For his duty already absolves him from the need to be known and seen: for he is already acquited. Yet steady, and as such, able to see by the fecundity in his oblige; whereby his gifts naturally extend, in both constance and design."
            <br>&emsp;Descarte and Hume on the other hand have this restless search for mystery. Yet, there is a contrast between the two, and of the sort which may remark their complexions. For both seem inquistive, and through that skeptical. And the source of this seems to occur by the falsity in the accustomed declerations. Where they differ, is that in order to find the truth further ahead, Descartes begins at the base of things, prooving he exists, all the while he doubts everything less reason provides; while Hume seems but leaned back, away from the indignence and cleracy of the accustomed front. But while Descartes creates the world anew, and finds in that a sort of novel understanding of the world, Hume merely inquires, and in that moves further than the truth once known, but to a point which is not itself complete. In that, Descartes is whole, yet mixed with ignorance and or complacence to his certainty. While Hume is merely alive and well within his further unknown. As such, Hume is remarked as being cheerfull and gallant; an instance of which is remarked in his tender comment regarding the false claim of man's wickedness, as compared to his ignorance --and that being the source of which we think is otherwise wicked. Descartes though, despite his adult acclaim, reaches a certain point as Nietzche, in that despite their productions and praise, they still remain inquiring, and bare the effect of being worn. Perhaps the key difference is that Hume is more happy and able, in that the unease which motiveated his inquiry was merely to state what he thought; wherein he moved past the norms, but by mere expression of a more well founded truth -albeit unwhole. While Descartes, and Nietzche similarly, sought to rebuild; the source of which can only be remarked in some form of their inquiry, as reflects the depth of their doubt. "While Hume merely saw false reasoning, and sought to speak clearly: while the former two saw a foundation in need of renew." 
            <br>&emsp;In effect, you have Descartes and Nieztche, full in their acclaimed ways, yet still pondering, as if the weight of being proper in their completion wore upon them; for as history shows, more thinking and fact was to come; so almost certaintly there fuller theories were indebitaly false. And my suspcion is that they in some sense knew that. Or at least by virtue of the evident adolescence of their thoughts, so was there still more for them to ask. While Hume, in all his gallantry, seemed more pleased to have offered what he thought, and by that progress, won. While the other two seemed more enstated to the wholeness of their offering; which in terms of  reward was perhaps foremost; for as we all know, Hume was only later in life remarked, while both Nieztche and Descartes were heradled as young men. The point however, is that upon the statement of a complete sort, that so did such an appeal by said makers, in terms of the care of such statement by such makers, weigh them down by the nature of such propsitions; in that, by their being supposedly whole, that the measure for things is almost always further than that which you can properly profess. And my point is not that the demands of the public, as remarked their fame, led them to further perfection; but rather, that their own care, as remarked their offerings, of a whole statement, did not absolve them of restless need or want upon such statement being made; as such a statement, in retrospect, and perhpas by the still present difficulties of whole statements, brought them to an endless weary. "Whereby what they sought, were credited to do, or merely thought by the liberty to do so,ledgered in them a ceaseless plea to reach said perfection. Fools of which they may have been, in that their methods were poor and false. But more than likely, it was there unsettled composition as to seek such completion, and see little in what they had, but what was still wrong." 
            <br>&emsp;Plutarch on the other hand is sentenced to something of an oddity. For if a man, less composed and centered as our friend, implores the idea of truth, then what is our friends actions worth? In that, of their supposed stabiliy, how are they rightfully so, when such truth is not known? Better yet, what worth is there in his novel offerings, when they are, for argument sake, mere thoughts; and not something which justifies his supposed stability, or advances the truth which would.
            <br>&emsp;I'd remark Caesor's words in this case, whereby he says 'that things afar seem larger then they actually are; and upon coming close, they seem so small'. By this, we are to understand that what we believe to be the case is not always a proper subject for judgement; in that, despite the readiest and fruitfull resolve upon a certain scenario, that such amends, or the need for any, are not themselves just by their very relation to a supposed event: said event must be there, and of the complexion in which our conclusions are based. Otherwise the proposition is wrong, and any lauded appeals based on it. 
            <br>&emsp;And the point overall, is that those who's inquiry, however flavorable, is born from restless pining, or at least an unceasing need upon the steadiest of progress, that so are the claims and or appeals from such squanched and squinted eyes unbecoming. "As the perfection which they see, or deem to be there in the mould of perfection, of which the properties need only be told, seems more a mark from someone whos sense of such a thing, in structure or filling, is from a hurried and leary mind." With that sentiment we may rest upon the ever advancing laurels of what bears warrant to our actions: whereby right and wrong, and at that bad and goodness, is bent upon the scale of which we know so far as true. And nothing more than what that moment suggests.

            So thinking of Plutarch, he seems the man whos efforts are born from the lessons of yore; in that, upon his lapse of responsibility, he learend the reason to amend; in both need and award. I compare him them with Hume in that each are quite settled in their path, in that life affords them needs which are common to most, and their place, per the collective of said most, is to be as they are fit within said most. Which in all simplicity, is to partake in the mode of such collective, be it governed, pastural or economic. And to cite our prior point, any caution and or concern as to the rest of the world, all while you partake in your own moral affairs, seems to be drawn by to hasty an eye. There are indeed things which are upsetting, and the conduct of the world does seem to stem from the accustomed truths, and their effect on culture and policy. But so ought one not hurry themsleves to a further truth, but simply speak their mind, offer their opinion, express the statements they think that truth would reflect. 
            <br>&emsp;But time must go on; and if we think that if we just reached completion that all would change, we tend to run ourselves over, and fall behind the ever-constant pace of things. Such things can be turned, but their results take centuries, if not the very least decades. And perhaps, as not to be flustered and worried about the inefficiency of the world, ought we be, in whats normal, and what is in all reason fair, set. For it is not so hard to find, that upon doing in a centered way, that our view of the world, in both its custom and effect, becomes less glaring or concise; but rather a medley of oceans and seas, lakes and streams, ponds and varied gusts of wind. As such, we see the world as less a point, but rather a broad system, of which we can only speak of in according terms. In effect, there is no event, or sight of said world, which is so as to draw a sense that perfection is needed; or a thing entirely to be found. For the truth in things, is that all the worlds knots lead to tighter points, or loose ones, and those enriched. But those sowers are but those rightuflly or not commissioned, to attend to their points, and mend them through the days and constant time. As such, our opinions are all that can be offered; as to influence those near and around us, or to some one who's commissioned effort creates too tight of knot. And by the parlance of credulity, so is the influence to one the source for another who's farther; as impressions get passed along. I believe this is why those prone to inquiry seek literary fame, for by prior times, and our expressive sense, that such fortuen and acclaim regarding such efforts is the way for broader changes to happen; as, per our word, so do more hear it. But none who are seeking such infamy, be it out of sympathy or whats vain, really have so much to say. There may be underlying influence, but only as much as you are in suspense enough to ask the novel question, do you produce anything worth remarking. And by that, the purest thing to do, is that which is not hasty or full of derision, but rather to do spread that which comes to you naturally, in your obliged state; one of which begins as if instructed, and that despite any true perill by which change is needed, so are we at least in line with our own affair. From which the mark of any with the plea for inquiry, comes gradually, and with a fashion of pure conception and regard: for of the world, of our wishes, to ends which were afraid not to me, so are we uninclined. Rather, we are at rest, treated, and at that wholesomely pleased. And what our eyes see is welcomed; nor is anything liable to imagery druged within us, but set with proportion; in which our sympathies are whole and fair, and not sweltered by grimmness. 
            <br>&emsp;To this, I say, with perhaps all the might of one who is calm enough to deem it, that by the ideal command, and our own false labors that have brought us of trajectory, that we ought be as such deeds would instruct us: or revert back to said path. "Wherein guidance is not that which bears us forward, but back."

        <div id="missedends">
            It is strange to consider that our instruction in life was wrong. For we seemed to be angled towards a set of experiences that our lessons were based on, in terms of what we could expect. 
            <br>&emsp;And indeed, our later life has levelled into seeing that the elements of such offerings were not far off; but in terms of their complexion and hue, so has the past, and our own sensibility, revealed otherwise.
            <br>&emsp;For I see that a child is a dear want. I may not desire one now, or a deep relationship. But these are bound to happen. And so much as they do, so are our personal efforts, be it vagrant or stable, strictly ill-fit for such affairs. "As they are, in all bareness, comparable to homes and cars, in that you must meet the requisite costs, including maintence."
            <br>&emsp;In that, per the truth in this, I see that our life's amends is such that family requisites are required. As far as I know, the cost of this is such, that for myself and partner, we need little more than what pleases us, and any minor addition in terms of what is practically required for bonded living; and for preference. But as remarks a child, of which I am sound to only have one, I see that our requisites are in principle and strict cost. For I don't believe that, beyond the special contents of the beginning, our need is to provide much more than we need ourself. And by that count, if we could offer what we each require, then the need would be as much as combining half more than what each of us already provides: as to warrant an additional hole. As our pairing introduces novel if not desired developments, so may our family be similar. But in esscence, beyond a small living for the two of us, to a more moderate one, so is there a relatively small living for our family, and a moderate one beyond that. For once we introduce the scale for instruction, we realize that our interest in having children is not much more than natural meaning and care; and of what we hold our child's interest to be, so is of the truest sort. Which is not, upon a brief relfection, impacted by living conditions beyond the moderate sort. 
            <br>&emsp;Briefly, I would mention the novel aspect of modernity, in that we can easily work remotely; and as such, live remotely, and by that, travel with our kid. Let us say though that such means were not available; and that, despite having such econmic means, that the oppertunity was not much more than occasional travel. For perhaps friends, or medical needs, required that we be in Canada longer. And to our point, in a permanent fashion, in terms of remaining local. What then would our life look like? For we'd satiate our own needs and that of our child. As would we raise them with composure, and the principle deed of integrating (our kid) with other people. But as I then think about education, work oppertunities and self expression, I am left with a blank sense of what we mean to do. For our life may in fact remain the same. And from there, we are more or less kept till our kid becomes their own. But that is likely a decade and a half away. Though perhaps the irons keeping us local would cease our child aged. By which our novel advent of remote work, could permitt us to travel. "For their development could have already occured, and they'd have more means to socialize and mingle in newer areas."

            I feel happily shot, 'like someone, disposed to peace, but is nervously comfortable'.
            <br>&emsp;It is not in any fair sense, the fault of those which spark our angst. Such a proclivity comes from the awkward bent of our soul. Nor do our questions as pertain to such soul, 'as if were were identifying the nature of that which was wrong', holds any real merrit when it comes to our insight; for such remarks really amount to compressing yourself out of this confined state, and in effect, drilling forever inward to some supposed source. The aim of this though is negative, in that it comes from our response. And as such, like the sun's glare, we turn away; but with the consquent neeed to find somewhere to go, in which our source being the problem becomes the fixation point. Yet we only burry further, never reaching a fixed end. "Like the awkard contraiety of nature's solid prescence, yet is more deeply evident to be small, bare, hollow." And our weary time comes from reaching for that voided point.
            <br>&emsp;In many ways, the mark of a man is in the simple fact that he's being one. Without comparison to other objects, I merely say, of the one which are, of a sort, are we so when we can speak, see, hear and touch; and with a sort of rigor, in that we are not to stirn or forwardly wrenched, nor to layed back and soft, but firm rather, solid, real, pure. 
            <br>&emsp;Our regression burns via the coals of kindling. And such things furry is up, and earn our mournfull care. But we are not but that which is born from 'drying the timber, and making us excitable'. And the irony is that in such a diffused state, we spend more time near the flame. 
            <br>&emsp;For in many ways the root of our ends is from our choices. And such choices, as make us dry and suscpetible, are bade from a ignorance to rules, and bumbling inquiry. A sort of conduct in which, less you remain enriched as a fool, 'you don't trust yourself, as you know the good that had once been before'. The burnt state were come's from a sort of tearing contrition, whereby we hastle ourselves out of this poor state, but invertly pitch ourselves into the ground; the effect of which, bares its form in  the way that such a pitched state seeks thing. For the things which are dear are those which we find delight in, in and from a state of joy. While the care we have in a burnt state, are of that which such a state can recieve. The treats of the former come only to those who have seen, and from that mould themselves to gleam further, and as such, hold no entrence to those whose sight has whithered away. We are so happily shot though, for we find remants of such pleasure even in our pitched state. Only, as we comfortably drive through the lands of gratuity, so are we charred in our surrounding epxression; in that those former goods, despite there lingering place, loose such prescence; making us somewhat resorted to keep to the goods on our drive, and to the effective end. And perhaps the point I mean to make, is that such objects, in all their flavor and charm, hold not whihc my memory dreams of of the past, nor what my content and pleasure relish as a promised future

        <div id="sightandscenery">
            The world of deduction bares us a brute end. Inquiry though, and working to principle, rather than from, is not an argumentative process, but one of observation. 
            <br>&emsp;From that, we remark upon what we see, and ask what it means. We may reckon the terms, as in the notion of how there's anything at all, or maybe we, in a scholarly or illustrative sense, paint the portrait of such observations, understanding what they are as objects, and what they mean. 
            <br>&emsp;And like Socrates exposition, Aurelius' reflections, or those comparable strides of Montainge or Emerson, so do we turn such sight towards ourselves, seeing who we are, and what we mean.
            <br>&emsp;There is a improper property though of this inquisition, namely the relation we have to the world, where we wonder how we are as to earn meaning by such things; in a similar light as to say, beyond what something appears, how it is in relation to the baser strands of nature, and being in general. By my accounts, this distinction between us and the world, and that of objects and the world (or nature), holds more sway via tradition than it does from merrit. And indeed, those blunt strides of deduction come from our attempts to be as such, where the admitted mysteries of ourselves (and things around) drives us to make explicit statements.
            <br>&emsp;Here is the beginning of things though, the channel for process. If we are to inquire, it is because we wish to and can. But the response to our prompts, which curries us to keep forward, is a remark as to the frontier yet ahead; and our according immaturity. If we are to deduce for the sake of completion, we are doing because our investigations are not full in their yields; and almost naturally so, considering they only mean  to desxribe and illustrate, rather than know. 
            <br>&emsp;In any case, we might say that our observation merely exclaims what's seen, and by that, concieves all things which urge our inquiry as things of an equally happneing sort. In the same way that the motion of the moon is but a sight we've seen, so is the rapid beat of our heart but a remark made, during a moment of exhaustion. Indeed, there is still a unmodern vocabularly as to the motions of our mind, in terms of our fear and curiosity; but the point still lays. We are not here mending words in order to reach some alternate deduction. Such an attempt would have us but in a different dress, but equally ordained to faulter. Said ways are but a blatant acceptence to our inquiry's shortcoming, and the consquent concession to proceed with the certainty which our observations can draw. The point though, is that said proclomations are but a stronger guess, there being some evidence to support them. But the consquence is one of disagreement, and the irony of there being so amidst a proclaimed certainty. 
            <br>&emsp;In that, I mean only to say what I see, and remark ourselves by a continued inquiry. The subjects of such pursuit are but rooted from things far and near that I've noticed; and as I have motions while running, fleeing and at rest, so are there finer motions --comparable to those dextrous-- when it comes to remarking upon things, and furthering ourselves as our observations spring. For instance, our angst is but a clawing sensation, pinning our openenss against a gritted wall. As in many cases, our very ailment from this blurrs our sense to recognize that we are experiening a symptom, rather than normality. But via the domain of all experience, and the natural bent of men and their outputs to other's around, so are there enrgaved motions and experience which trickle out of these confined and senseless states; to the point where a clear recognition occurs, and resolution attempted. 
            <br>&emsp;Weirdly though, those prior experiences which hold there place beneath the surface  level disturbances, have there place via similar recognitions and resolves. Said motions may have been brought on by parental guidance and pleas, or the bulk of common strides which retain in us some core propiety. Riding a bike for instance never goes away, even in a delerious state. Nor do we lose our means to read, speak, walk and breathe, despite possible erosions from a current ailment. And the point, is that in all things, or moments rather, some recognition and resolve occurs, if not by a drip. In a word, the slightest slope will bring all water to the sea, and by that, will the ocean rise. Our experiences fair accordingly.
            <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst these subjects, or recognitions in myself, is the lack of curisoity regarding death. It seems common, in drama at least, that children often wonder what death means, and what happen's when we die. I would say that their somewhat concerned, and likely so for they've heard remarks about; such things being the charms of the wind blowing by from time's past. But looking at the source for such gusts, you come to the question as to why anyone remarked upon death at all? Is it for the simple reason of closure, or comfort; to know that a loved on, or yourself, were set for some fine destination? I really can't say. Nor am I left with anything but two glaring points, namely as to the concern for a destination at all, and whether or not such concept held a dual end: meaning that the afterlife was regarded, and the promise of the light side being reached held one's comfort. 
            <br>&emsp;But both sentiments seem obscure in their origins? And only mention that, for in our current time, where the utterings of such things are, as I said, heard through echoes of older ways, and by that  practiced by those who gleam to such, but in private, that so are we in some sense left with an original question, like those in that rooted past. For we are not presently with any pre-conception or influence to what death would mean, nor, I admitt, is there much which strikes me as being relevant about it. In fact, considering that we are influenced by the words of others, and in a better light, encouraged by those who, depsite not being afraid, still reflect and define for good in inquiry, that so in our own remarks, have we relished in a fair and simple concept of death, one in which the comparison to sleep has me seeing both as calm and gentle. "Such a statement, albeit driven out of curioisty and principle definition --and not fear- holds in me a sort of strenght and secuirty; for death indeed, albeit not inherenlty frightening, does hold a sort of neccessity; and by that, having a defintion gives the course of yuor life some sense." And it would not be right of me not to mention the obvious notion of death's appeal, when the fact of its mystery pairs with that ultimate point of it. But I am not sure whether the culture which developed in terms of it, was so by their own means to develop some sort of finality, for it's own sake. 
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, I reckon the most prominent source of our regard for death, lies in our closer mysteries, namely mentaility. For such a thing, whereby dreams, vison, fear and doubt are colored, holds with it the deepest yet obscure relevance to our life. And I believe that, the weight we fairly give to such things, in binding with the little of it which we truly know, makes for a sort of baser uncertainty about things. "For we don't even know ourselves." But it is not so far off, by my account, to suggest that the obscurity of death does not pair with the obscurity of our mind; and that the apprhensions and wobbliness which come from the latter, meld with the nature of former being unknown. There's surely more to this, but we might say, in one sense, that our condition, or provclivirty rather, to be nervouce and or unsure, makes the greatest thing of uncertainty, in death, the more concerning. This is likely why the steady man still benefits from defining death, for he is at least sure amidst his comfort; while someone less sturdy, seeks for a relief to their fear, the defintiion of which bears them said claim.
            <br>&emsp;Where I land then is in the managment of oneself, and how this, by its ordinary stability, procurrs that indifference to death. For like a threat approaching, even the bravest of us locks onto it; unafraid sure, but attentive to the thing which their bravery holds them up to. But those nervous act the same, and likely moreso, in that their fear of something, draws their attention to it further. And so, by one's proclivity, not only is there view of it likely different, but so is their care for it equally less. 
            <br>&emsp;The question though, is what would bring a man, in all his composure, to attend to death; or find reason and principle to do so. For I am sure that there are other men like me, who have no fear of death's mystery? It also may be so that their confidence brings their attention elsewhere, and away from death's waiting eye. By that, death never scared me, or alarmed me personally as we made our own broader attentions. But, the nature of such attentions were such, that our grip on life was not solid; and so the postive response from defining death, brought with it some strenght for that. As I'd state it, our efforts brought us to an open view of the world, and with that, an annoyance with cheap words, a fear of whether they might be right, a rancour as to our self-inccured afflictions, and a cheerfull heart which bore us a measure for such contraierty. There are life lies.

            As in most things, our limited knoweldge prevents us from making simpler inquiries. In this case, I feel too stuck in comparing deductions with observation; and at that, the irksome point of poor concepts home to the former.
            <br>&emsp;But alas, I can say, as I think I last mentioned, that my life is such, that it found itself moving a certain way, but in such strides as were in relation to the world; and by that, the obscuirty of such extent brought with it a tearing sensation, 'as if there were fires on the horizon'. To this day those flames still flare, but it is our personal solidity which has rendered them less scorching.
            <br>&emsp;Where I fail, or have not yet succeeded, is in a full portrayal of the unknown world. For deductions are not wrong, nor are the results of observation truly insightfull. But there is a great deal to say, and winding all the aspects together fairs a great struggle. For it is hard to remark upon things, when you admittedly suggest they are not in the way you use them. But as deductions take things for granted, regardless of merrit, so do those who suppose do the same; in that their observations  lead them to principles, or assumptions, which are in accords to an accurate view of the world. Yet the ground still has depths to go. And at heart, it is that tug o war between the course to knowledge, and the completion of it; the latter always being evidently premature, and the former never ceasing course.

            There seems not much more to life than experience and principal. 
            <br>&emsp;However, each seem to be derived from some deeper truth, and a contested one at that. Namely, that of our experience, so do we mean that which we've observed, or been impressed by. And to remove the confusion of sensibility and objects, let us simply indicate this sentiment as one of relation; as we would describe a balls bounce of a wall, to which the motions fairly lie. For the other, lies the root contention, namely whether the source of our principles and declarations are completely born from experience. As a likely result of experience being the source of said affirmations, so to the limits of our relations lie as the spring for declaration: as not to be stuck progressing throug inquiry. But beyond the motivation and resolve, the point lies in whether or not our principle reasoning is born from what we have already experienced. The Humian in me says it does; at least such sentiments do suggest this. Namely, that of the truth which we proclaim, be it of neccasary motions and conduct, to the meaning and or reality of objects on terms of that, that so does a) the urge to affirm come from our experience thus far, and by that, our incomplete dealings with the world, and b) that what we see as born from the truth (now affirmed) is too bade from experience; nor, and formoest, do the elements and or strides of our reasoning bear themselves from anything other than what we've experienced so far. Indeed, one of the fair contentions is that, albeit true that our sight and hearing are impressed upon by the world, and of such qualities which we'd see and or deem in reaosning, that so would those inputs bear the source of our notions: the material if you will. But it is otherwise said, that of our thinking, in it's varied form, that these are not so much the senses in play, and by that receptors during experience, but rather something innate, intelligence, on par with the deeper streams of nature which we suppose. In a Humian way though, I'd wonder how our regards for such thinking are identified without the contents of our sensible impressions. Is the form of something, be it in color or proportion not derived from our experience with such qualities? And in many ways, there seems not but a progressive dimunition of abstracteness, whereby the subject of our thoughts is not merely an arrangment of what we've experienced, but formed in our mode of thinking. Mathematics seems the key mystery then, for the marshalling of logic, or deduction rather, still uses subjects that bear there cloth from our impressions; while numerals seem inherently abstract. But I would say, that our sense of numerals being so, comes not from our imagining of them, as the vision of 1 or 2 still holds with it some objective form. Rather, it is the relations which we deem, or see mathematically, and the consquent feeling that their reality is beyond objective. In this though, I would say that as we remark upon things of a real sort in such way, as to correspond with proportions and relations, that so do the strides of mathematics merely stem from what is inherent to the syntax. "That if such and such occurs, by the natural relation of numbers, something happens." And by my account, this is itself an observation.

            I say these things, in part, because of our modern times. Times of which the truth is able to seen, or rather sought. But so in that, lies the free expressions of promiscuity, things obscene. And by that, by whichever cause, our course into the world's view brings with it burnt impressions of its harsher matters. And to that I care the least. For violence and tryanny are not clean subjects. But as material, and something which we can relate to, so are the impressions from inappropriate things a detriment to such ends. To be clear, said things are not inappropriate, as in the case of poor behaviour, but rather as sources for seeing the properties of those harsher subjects. For one, these sources are quite oppressing, in that their form is very dense, saturated and expressive. This does not lead to understanding though, but merely a pure digestion of everything they offer. On that, the actual merrit in what they have to say makes this consquence a fault, simply because the quality of their impression stands small besides those of other sorts. Said alternatives not only leave with you a fuller impression due to the conduct of their form; but so does the material hold more nuance and proportion. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps, by our younger ways, we were so overt to the common path, that the submission to one more freeing and liberal, held with it an open lane to the farther parts of the world. And from that, our igorance of such matters lead to a mixture of over-confidence, 'as if we in fact knew', and gratuitous contempt, 'where the apparent elments of the world gleamed upon us, but without any accuracy or proper receptiivty (by us)'. And this is why, by our irksome despiar regarding such ingestions, did we lawyer over the inneuendos and promsicuity which we normally consumed. Such things have their place, and like in sobriety, so is it partly pleasing. But our pressue and condition towards the fuller world, hold no bars when it came to awkward insights of it's total elements. And through reflection and honesty, we recgonized that our nomral ingestions were both sourcing the imagery which those foregin ideas were made from; and otherwise rotting ourselves away, as we sought to see the world without being tugged by such novel elements, and better yet define them with proper sources.

            My brain is burnt, and I'm putt off by everything. I appreciate that our emotions are not so filled with envy and fear; but the former does seem to linger, albeit postive, while the latter still comes up, when something less respected by me strikes our cooked mind.
            <br>&emsp;All I'll say is that we are a certain way, and from that, open ourselves to thorny impressions. Why we are such a way, time does tell. But as to the form and pace of such state, that is more remarkable.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the time of my youth was met with a sort of lifeless commissery; whereby the sentiment of school and profession held me in a muted gaze. I rebelled though, recklessly in some cases; by in that, as our turn was not so horrid, so did our neutral state prime us for a different path. For we had always been young, open and kind, but held not grit or delight in the promsie of tradition. As I mentioned, our contarry efforts were of either idleness or gratuity; but so did our environment and natural complexion shed off the harsher sides of this. Leaving me then in a tempered state, I was struck by things of a redeeming sort; in the way that those in struggle turn to idoltray. I did the same, particularly when it came to productivity and prudence. Guided mind you with a modern bend. 
            <br>&emsp;Here though our story lies, for in that wake, we shed off any lingering attention to the properties of norm, and instead burrowed ourselves in to the matters of health, writing, and eventually reason. As it happened, those early days were ripe with vehemence; partly to affirm ourselves and void negative reception, as well as to inbed our simmering passion for a life further and bound. As time went on though, those emtions began to bade, and the eagerness to please and obsess washed off. 
            <br>&emsp;The result though was not one of grand progress, but rather solitude and mute sentiment. Our life was rather ornate in the basest of ways, and our free time and care was laundered by nothing other than our novel pleasantry. The story goes though that we emboldened the latter by reading older texts, and found both merrit and means in our self-goverened way. From this point our life pitched up, but not to any fufilled end.
            <br>&emsp;You see, that early portion of our formative ways, was one that held a clear villain: the lack of living which would produce depression; and the promiscuously gallant life which we held too little love or fortitude to embrace. By that, it was easy to ignore the future and sink into passivity; and otherwise grow into those reverant ways. Such reverence though did not procure much more than novel satisfaction. There was a large amount, but the world around seemed either intrusive or contemptable. I'd remark the fact that in those days we'd plan everything; from meals to bed time. While our more settled chapters held less reservation to naturally be, as perhaps guided by our experience thus far. But you see, therein lies the change, in which the good which I procucred against the bad of tradition, that so did our 'tradition' develop into a full and settled state; whereby we needed no more aversion or aggrssion towards such norms, but rather to simply be ourself in the way we pleased. Indeed, there were lessons, and much of our matured stated brought with it the mud of prior emotions. 
            <br>&emsp;That is however, the concern for the recent past and our coming memories; as such strides are what we'd remark upon in terms of the bearing our past deciions gave. As for those times, it is the case that we sunk into ourselves, and held less occupation by purely being ourself. We had been so obsessed with such as a matter of validation and engagement; propogated mind you by the happiness this brought. But as the heat from tradition died down, and our ease of reaching finer pleasure ensued, so were we left without occupation or ends. Indeed, I found much which brought further light to that path, whereby we saw more that we could do, and by that, further goods we could reach. 
            <br>&emsp;But this soft abandoment of common committments, and our otherwise flourishing through our private governance, brought with it a sort of division regarding possibility. For the good from me has always been enough; and never anything but lacking ourselves and right action, would bend me off that vibrant road. But our place amidst people, time and things while being such way, brought with it a sort of trouble and confusion. For my efforts were such that they could almost naturally procure themselves: I still needed a home though. And by that, our pecuniary efforts saw an expected exchamge between me and other folks. But via our fear of revealing our personal governance, our reservation to be more involved as not to run contrary to such governance --and by that have to explain why--- and our more common and emtional desires (in both love and praise), we errored in finding any broader footing, in both comfort and profession. It was not so much that being ourself was a struggle, or unfufilling, but the basic pressure from being so occupied warranted the deeper feelings that had been covered through our maturing state. But, our efforts to partake in such, and succeed, failed on the count of being as our we were in that governed sense. We never adapted, partook, or spoke in ways that were relevant or effective for the ends our feelings sought. And as those matters failed, we found life restraining, and sought freerer time to be myself. I have learned recently that the means to said feelings is not so challening, or contrary to your goverened self. which is encouraging. But that is merely a remark of our less than free state, continuing to care for the goods of our governance, but with the acquaintences which soothe the emotions which our duties erect. "And our maturing state held to much fear and too little means for relation per our personal state; and so the conditions which sprung our hope for relations and growth remained unchecked, and thus turned us to conditions which were less demanding."
            <br>&emsp;In other words, we learned to be ourself in a resourefull way upon our abscence from the common path. As the concentration for this left, and our natural gait was of that formed complexion, so did we further enrich such state, and simmer our care and judgement for it's goods.

        <div id="oldflakes">
            Tradition has lost its stature. The effects of it linger, but so are we merely asked to contend with that as we freely explore.
            <br>&emsp;Such dispositions of the past hold not much more than a sensible view of the world, which rests on both the function of it, and our surrounding oblige. As we ignore the ucstom of the latter, despite being free to beleive what we want regarding the formeer, so do I find much comfort and peace in affirming such things, as it mends our tendancy  to be on our own.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, if I removed the notions tangled on the weeds of mentality, I am left with a fairly deemed concept of the world. Considering the legacy of observation, and the pressures exerted onto the seams of pure reason, I can say that all things seem constant and orderly. By that, our place in the world, orbiting the sun, with plants and man foraging about, so our life lay. By that, I fear no interuption of things, and can remark upon my life as if the things I commonly observe, and know to be present by other's observatoins, are true. I do see the plea for reason, as to rightly know. But our proclivity of thought is one that affords little concern for the concepts and truths born in the past: as such things, despite there fullest attempts, seem to hold their aboslutness in small borders. And my calmet principle, is that iwthi nthe borders that our observations profess, there is neither mcuh which is suggested as our purely reasonable statements would propose; nor, foremost, is there much to concern yourself with outside said borders, which you may suppose. By that notion, I don't deny or refute reason, nor the attempts to bind the modern borders. But there is little merrit I see, in the more animate and customary interprations brought from the past. Namely that they rest on what I can only say is a cesing ambiguity of mentality. 
            <br>&emsp;In that, I can say that our need to affirm, or remark at least baser things, is that our more common actions are so far off, that having a sturdy point from in front and behind, eases our time while doing so.
        </div>
        <div id="thecomingbound">
            I turned my head as my time as a boy was ending; and the direction of my gaze peered inwards, and happily so. Prior to this, my time had been either reckless or somber, and the resolve to mend both seemed out of reach, or uninteresting. As a sort of boiling point occured, I amended to what I was drawn to, and that was myself.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the proclivity for such cares were such, that by the inportance which self-regard brought, I was wholly prepped to converge with such. Upon doing so, I worked myself through efforts and tasks that were a benefit to me personally, be it in prudence or calm delight. 
            <br>&emsp;As the years went on though, our discipline began to settle in, and our need to attend things became less about focus and managment, but rather letting it naturally happen. But as the norms of our gait turned, so were we left with little to attend. We warmly felt the heat of our inner glow, but without the deeds to tend the flame, we felt unoriented. In effect, the common obligations we had began to feel more like burdens than provision. And the result was that the goods which our disposition proccured, felt intruded upon by those civil tasks. Resulting from this was a barron appeal to some route that seperated me from such mundaneness. But this resolve was fruitless, and we were left with nothing else but our self, and the civil norms.
            <br>&emsp;From  this point I realized that our need for things could not be met outside civil affairs. I turned my head towards things which would afford more excess in the things we needed, and more simplicity and fulfullment in the means to them. This part of the path though did not lead to success. As it were, we were well in our intent, and quite able to achieve something. But by our behavior and choices, we did not follow through. And as these aims were subject to our adolescent character, so did our care for romance and friends equally suffer. 
            <br>&emsp;Time then began for me, in that I questioned little of our happiness and its appeal; but the stability which this was propped on held not but a dim light. There was just something about having to provide for the things I cared for, that had me filled with envy and shame. Reasoning that our ends justified the mundane means felt hard to convene with; if only because such reasons were too private, and by that, hard to share. As it happened, we spent our time fiddling and meandering, trying to find acceptance and fortune, as to bear our simple needs a simple furnishment. This did go well, and these years were not short of positive. But the truth, is that nothing but our momentary grace ever came to fruition. And despite having a range of dreamt and firm predictions, so were we merely alof on time's current, never set or ordained for anything beyond. We simply settled and sat at the point we were at, letting our fortuity and felicitiy grown.
            <br>&emsp;Upon this age, where we found ourself, and thereupon the solidity of its frame, so have I struggled to fill that form with any constant amount of living. You see, life is hard to particpate in, as the candor of her sides, albeit bright, hold a draining effect by the surrounding amends to her stirn requirments. I always morned over our need for such affairs, as the cost of them seemed so protuding into our calmer delights. That, and the nature of those delights were such, that all I needed was the meagerest means to sufficiency. But our mature state did not afford us anything more than the admission that we needed satiation. 
            <br>&emsp;From this day where I now live, I have learned and grown, dreamt and reflected; and here and now, in the greenest of places, we have not but a lingering amount of weeds. For our time and ways is not ordained to far off fancies, nor the crushing defeat of our overly stirn regards. We have moulded ourself to care, in a way that remarks the world in all her depth and light; a way that holds me accountable to both her promsie and place, via actions which our common, needed, and affordable. By that, we need not dream of a time when our sweet delights are free for us to tend to; as we do not see this as realistic, nor a misfortune. It is true, that life demands that you breathe, eat and keep warm. Nor does she permitt you to acheive this nasically or happily, without the abilities and slant of man. But our time in the recent year and days, has shown me that our shortcomings have purely come, from our ill treatment of our own portion of that slant, and the fufilling process of being both stable and fed in the whole of life. To much had our aims been garnered on the goods of reason; yet such a manner was not fully stated, in either a mature sense of the world, and our appropraite requirments. As a boy we held no belief in the common end; but to another we did not know, and thus go. We turned to ourself; but it is fair to characterize this as someone finding joy in not; or at least delight outside a path. Truly, the fruits of that became the path itself. But this is not what we feel is offered by reason, nor what we find true in reflection. For the goods our governed way are not so as to be comeplte in themself; but rather as an assortment of scents and flavors that blossom upon our stride living. For no bad day cuold cease enough to prevent our calmest cares being met. And the moral, or lesson rather, is that the goods of reason are merely those which formed on another of life's path; one which holds its candor and hues to all her sides and shades. And from that, our insight is that the steps we take, and to the glimmer on the horizon, is such that of this path which reason exacts, so must we take it as if it were the path were on.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed, the part of our writing which lies like an iceberg under the sea, in part lies in the matter of defintiion. But such elements are merely there as a means of binding against your inefficency. For it is not one in motion who must reflect and treat, but those who fail; as strictly, they have done so if being is no longer bade. For that is what reason is for; to orchestrate what you feel and expect based on your past and place within nature. For however she is, and what we wish she'd be, so are our motions fair and finest, when they can be ordained to be so, as the world accepts. And quite literally, all actions are such, that they warrant reproval, if upon use they elicit the hault of being.  And so, as time can finely exclaim, that tradition, naievety and an otherwise wordly progress, garners a need to iron out the effects of imperfection, to bear clarity in how your proceed imperfectly, and otherwise remark on the goods which make it worthwhile to progress to. For it is all too easy to abide with whats common; as such norms feel laudible by there lasting prescence. But life is always changing, and the standards of now are but the deeper strands which life has not yet woven out. None of us really act in the way that those in the 1800s did. Nor do we see things fundementally as those a millenia ago. But despite admitting the contrast of the former, and the differing norms which our standards now reflect, it is in those of olden days, far back in the faintest history, that still hold a basic thread; one of which our own deepst cares and beliefs reflect. And one which, upon a mere honest observation, can over time be shown to leave nothing but scarrs. But as we don't do what those in recent centuries did, for such manners seem immediate in their antiquation, so is it those deeper threads which take time to iron out. And the fairest way to succeed this, is to

        <div id="therighttodeem">
            So the world is more or less a certain way; and of the way it is, so is there a way to be. It is worth noting that a natural view of the world, no matter the colors or proportions, is more or less assumed. If we do not assume it, then it seems better to look past any practical matters. Or, at the very least, if nature was in fact all dual and loopy, ought we define the elements of our oblige in such accords. "For it seems wrong to view things in a certain way, all the while we hold our standards in a different light: the two ought reminsicen one another."
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, of the world and how she is, it is important to note that our view of such is drawn primarily from how she seems; and as such, we deem our amends based on what such view amounts to. Only, this view is mixed between sentiments which are present and lasting. In that, our sense of things may be born from beliefs that have thei heritage upon the beginning of time. Or it may be something that is newly contemporary.
            <br>&emsp;In all of this, I see much importance in simply illustrating the scope of things; and by that, having but a point of view, that perhaps sees both sides, but then merely inclines. For I do not know much; as the deeper nature of things is both a matter itself, and otherwise obscure is its depths reflect. Nor do the definite strands of the world afford much reasoning for which our natural inquiries obsess. But we may rest on the observations we do have. And considering that much of what we believe sits upon surrounding sentiments, so may we remark the points of we which remark some, of the deeper sort maybe, all the while we oblige the specifics which derive from such sides. For instance, if our view of family is born from the roots of civilization, then our current sense may simply spring from that direction. But if we hold more anthropoligical sentiments, then so may our ends seem differnet; considering the possible pitch from points further back. Despite the compaisons being somewhat absent, I simply wish to say that if you are going to consider farther points, and by that simplify more recent ones (which we might have seen as being relativley far back), that our otherwise further regard is not itself a marker of truth, if only because it is further. It is fair to think that the further back you go, the more narrow the points become, as there are either less; or those which are there, are so that they have been precisley seen; for things so far back would not otherwise be deemed, if they in fact were not seen. So past the edge of common concepts, there is a cohesive bend to most observation. If we applied this sentiment though to the remarks of nature herself, then we might say that our descripition of things, for instance the universes simplicity, would be a perspetcive amidst others, each hovering around a shared point; the perspepctives being a variation of concpetion and understanding (theory even) of a piece of evdidence; the nature of which, holds not much more than the doubts of measures and submission. So upon verification, we may simply vary in terms of what we think.
            <br>&emsp;On this note, I would say that our modern permitt to view things naturally, permitts us to consider our efforts via the truth of our personal world; and thereby not the one which governs the whole. In a similar light though, the idea of life, and by that the candor and process of it it's way, is comparable to the borders of our 'natural view' and that of the depths below. In this case, we'd say that on the natural end, wherey observation stacks ontop of that obscure frontier, that so the microbes of Archeon lay. Indeed the border lies between the geology of the Hadeon, and that of microbial fossils in early Archeon. It is prpphecised that polymers, a sort of medley of moleucles which blended, led to the early forms of that which would become microbial. Of this I do not know; and of the relation and resemblence to commonly known cells, I cannot say. But what I would then suspect, and bend to, modern sentiment surely consigns.
        </div>
        <div id="anaturalline">
            So, not to get in some knots, considering the comparitive points I spoke about, but we might benefit from just creating a natural line. 
            <br>&emsp;For one, we're in agreement that our humanity is born from the planet, and it is a self contained system within the nature of things. By that, our being as man is marked by our lineage as apes, and the consquent development from the various stages of man. Despite being characterized by our use of tools, the bulk of these stages can only loosely describe the deeper elemnents which we generally remark as human. Namely, language, memory, imagination, along with the social formations which governance and custom refer. These elements, albeit sourced from an age ago, hold their prominence in the recent three hundred thousand years. Indeed this may be granting too much; as per our notion that the compleixities of man, at least the arrangment that gives such qualities any prevlenance, that so may the primordial forms of these have remained till much later. I am willing though to say, that by 100,000 B.C, that we were more or less governed, similar in manner to current day indigenous tribes. Nor was our language so ape like, but more elaborate; differing perhaps in that it was not so refined; but able still to be particular. And it seems a fair tenant to suggest that the more concrete and definite motions of our mind blossomed in parallel with language.
            <br>&emsp;In terms of family, the root of this holds its baser form millions of years ago. Mammals in general hold some motion which reflects a family; a parental harmony at least. Where the discrete mention of this though comes in, is when our behaviour becomes more clear and deliberative; whereby our engagement with hunting for instance, comes about with communicative forthought and reflection. The conduct and relations which motivate and manage our family is similar to that, as are all kinds of relations: family being a mere portion of that.
            <br>&emsp;But indeed governance comes in, for the purpose of family is accompanied by the efforts which were obliged to greet. In terms of relation, governance is a sort of commisery and custom as to collectivley facilate such ends. And by that, the need for family is mixed with the novel interest one has for it, and so the latter committs amidst the needs of governance.
            <br>&emsp;At this point, we are left with the question of neccessity, as family pertains. And in esscence, there is a side to this which feels essential, namely in the continuation of man. But the origins of these happenings hold a distinct place when compared to our modern times. Namely, in the way that our collective functions, and how the motions of old derive custom. For in that far off way, the concerns of the many was in their collective means for shelter and satiation. And as custom was pillared upon this, in both the agreement of folk to partake, and the aim of authorities to commission, that so would the purpose of family lay; in that, as if an neccessity on the basis of propogation, but seperate in kind from our need for food, that so were each, in their basic kind, consented on collective need for this. This was the soul lens at least.
            <br>&emsp;In modern times though, the proficiency of man, in his stable continutation, sprouted into points of progress, whereby the primary objects of older times (and their governance) could be amended with less concentrated points. The pillars remained, yet less folk were require to hold them up. And by that, more could do as they please: and the custom folded around such freedom. 
            <br>&emsp;We may speak of culture later on, but I would like to mention the advance of our freedoms. For just as the pillar of satiety needed the whole to erect, and the agrarian advents which allowed for success without every hand, that so in the following millenias were other frameworks developed; not only to a point which further stationed the basic pillars ---of both an original and novel time--- but to an end which was full of pillars of a pleasing and kindred sort. Engineeering comes to mind, in that enough hands were free to erect the Pyramids of Gyza; or the mere splatters of tech, in masonry and printing. So upon this did the world birth an economy, and firmer stations of people as remarked it. 
            <br>&emsp;From this though, lies the hearted question, namely of our needs amidst said economy, and the deeds to bide it. Generally, it is hard to say, for the assertion of any sentiment requires an elegant proposal. From where we've come, I'd say were on track to exlaim the present: but such statements are what need to be done, and bringing what we know and what we now see is quite hard to do.

            So consider two populations of people, or governances rather. Each may be a hegemon, or empire; they may be ruled by a king, a minister; and more likely than not, they are seperated into provinces, kingdoms or states; and better put, the arrangment of these amdist one another, be it federally or the empire, remarks there total status.
            <br>&emsp;Now, generally speaking each form compares in the orientation of crown and county. Where they differ is in how sharp the point is, and how broad the base is. In any case, if there is a conflict between both blades, then subjects within the base are called up to fight; be it to blunt the other knife, take some of its base, or merely defend the same interests of the other. As it were, the destruction caused is usually to those involved in the fighting, and those amidst the figthing grounds. Generally speaking, the back lands see little damage, while those on the front receive the most. If there is conquest, then so may the path taken by the victor lead to damage along their route. More often then not though, upon their cease of land or crown, the subjects of the defeated state become members of the conquerer. Their status may not be as it was before; and almost surely their custom and ways will alter. But beyond the loss of those who won and lost, so is the time ahead slanted up. 
            <br>&emsp;In terms of conduct, the horror of conflict lies in the trauma one recieves. There may be fiendishness, strict laws and according severity; or there may just be censors, curfews, obdience and according custom. 
            <br>&emsp;What is important to note though, is that good and bad occurs in the heart and minds of people; as are crimes committed to and from folks. A community though, suffering instance over the loss of a neighbour, is merely a emotion shared by those who held similar relations with the one lost. If only one person knew them, and their feeling was such, a grievence within the community merely marks a broader amount of people who knew. 
            <br>&emsp;In that way, we can define one's actions as particular to them; and along with that, that such actions were defined by the depth of such path, as opposed to generalizing across the norm of more than one. In that way, a solider is made aware of a conflict, goes through recruiting, travles and initates themselves to the operation, trains, is transported, begins their service, as a mechanic, medic, artillery officer or man of the front. And for each, their path is such that, be it a battle in the evening, or a skirmish at noon, that upon its end, and by fortune's gain, breakfast, lunch and dinner lie. Nor does rest avoid them; and if nerves, trauma and fear grind them to a sigh, then so do angst and boredom occur. Only, while they are amidst their post, near or far from the cliff side. And as for battle, let us just say that a man's service and pain is earns him respect, and affords him pride. Nor in injury or violence, is he home to any but himself; and by that, subject to anything but his character, heart, courage, and is candor and hue for action. Not a shots been fired, nor a hit recieved, that was not of one ill-fit for this description. Someone though who took pains to inflict more upon others, or cackled and smiled at other's hurt, such makes a fiend. And indeed, I say all of this, for despite being well spoken of the groups and divisions which partook in such conflicts, it is almost absent of any to really know path of any given man. And from that, as you lean back and adjust to your own humanity, and otherwise step down the tracks of actual men, you realize that what is likely so and common for all men, is not so fiendish, nor anything short of civil; but merely law being executed, and foreigners being spat at. But any hurt delivered to them, is but arsenal being used for the operation, or the severity of penalities which policy exhibits. And none hold but a seldom mark from the pity establishment of modern and stupid men.
            <br>&emsp;At heart, man is but a wandering animal, happy with others as he is with the comfort of food. Indeed, it would seem fair to say that part of the warmth he feels to others, is in the confidence they bring him in his pursuit of goods and things. Such desires are furnished by the support other's offer. But as for the path he's actually come, so is this hard to chart. And less we remark upon things in the most basic of ways, then our ignorance will hault our inquiry. For it is not true that man was so, then governed, then economic, but rather they were men, each with a name, or being, with a nature that had them convene. And from that, by the heaves and hoes from Erectus to congress, so has there been not but a day, where the minutely furthered slice was experienced. Bit by bit the days grow, to the point where a novel piece is fitted. But we are truly part of a massive puzzel; and as to remark the truth, ought one only in time use the biggest pieces. Or, if they do as the world is now, hold little speculation and stateliness, and be but general as the world seems present. Then even, how thick is each piece, regardless of the single layer. For the names of countries do not encapsulate them. Nor do the words and ways of their governent express the conditions of their people. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, the world is always in a moment. But in extent, the pieces in play are but systems of their own. And each of these holds with it a sort of structure and quality, of which one ought not generally suggest, nor the other being summaried and in fairness forgotten. As it were, how things were and how things are, give us insight to how things should be. But predicting the future holds with it a great demand to be thorough in your statement. For if the world is full of strucutures and objects inside them, then the future state of the world will simply remark the arrangement of that. If the present then, and winds of the past, speak to the road ahead, then so ought the complexion of that road, as we'd only care to know, be a scale in which our basis for prediction stands on. "For it is foolish to look up from a world which holds a thin form and empty substance, and expect to likely see a point ahead with otherwise qualities." Furthermore, it would be unnecassrily astute to claim that our predictions should be of the world as it fully is, rather than we thinnly imagine. And if so, then the propiety of our present statements is laid, and the scale for whether or statements are meaningfull at all. For the future is important indeed, but if your proclomations are sprung from a small view, then the end which you see is seemingly worthless.

            The economy, being a result of excess, holds in it a sort of potential; in that by industrial means, folk are not only subject to the riches of the economies state, but able to produce.
            <br>&emsp;For the way an economy works, is that attention can be paid to developing goods and service. Because this requires time and care to faciliate, people  can sell their efforts; and those managing the venture purchase it with a wage. The modern economy though also permitts more and more people to begin ventures; be it in craft or art. For a venture is traditionally one of exchange, in that a resource is manufactured for consumption, labored by those who earn wages to produce, and purchased by those who's seperate income permitts their interest to buy. But the means to this can be translated into ventures which are less of industry, but creation; namely in printing, visual arts, and the modern variations. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, the modern state of the economy is such, that people may cultivate an equitable fortune, in that their efforts can be servicable, rather than compensitory. Alongside this, folk may invovle themselves in such ventures, as laboroers fit for this creative venture. This is where the trades of film, media, design and games come in. And indeed, if one initiates a pursuit of film making, and hires those to work, so may those people partake in the ways of such creation, and bolster themselves for future creativity --of an equitable sort. 
            <br>&emsp;By that token, I mark our lingering interest to play and create when it comes to gaming, study and film. And because of this, the craft of video making seems a draw. Moreso, when I look at our life in terms of needs, and the according earnings we seek, so is there a course for investing in our means, namely in that of video/media production. For such lanes hold the side of things which I care for, and the genersous interest I imagine. This seems then like an oppertune path, as it makes use of the creative industries within the economy, and our skills and relations within the field which I'd wish to create. 
            <br>&emsp;In this way the world lies. And per the economy, so are we in but an elabortae form of the orginal system. In that case, there were pillars which had to be held up everyone. Eventually, less were required, and more could attend to other things. From that, new pillars were held up. As time went on, the mode of the system changed to a principal excess, whereby the arrangment around food and shelter was but a baser layer, upon which the relations of commerce and leisure ran. It seems that we are still in it, having changed only in the means by which new pillars (of goods and service) were made. And indeed, the baser governments held some sort of custom over commerce, as to make it fair and equitable: both in labor and exchange. In many ways, the purpose of government was in binding the pillars that the collective held together; and the economy is but a higher layer which people partake in; and like a well which everyone brought water from, so is the governmetns an equal faciliator in the pools of commerce.

            From what I know, there is a both a dream and means to creating things online. Life is not so wholly from doing so, but there is a novel appeal, and practical advantage. 
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, the greatest barrier to entry is in consistency. For if you wish to validate your channel, grow it, and earn from it as you find your stride, then you will have to post. This is why picking a niche and formatt which fits your capacity is essential. Making a podcast could be alright, but I don't think I want to make 50 of them before I make a penny. Shorts on the other hand, particularly on plump platforms like Tik Tok, can be oriented in a lasting bulky way. There's no guarentee though. But it is worth noting that your progress and familiarity will bring you to consistent points of satisfaction, anticipation and humility. "I recall our first videos to hit 600 views, and how good that felt." Our videos weren't terrific though; and if the material was the core element, so was it of something old. 
            <br>&emsp;One of the oddities in all of this, is that none grant you a reward, nor prevent you from gaining. In some sense, the motions of users on a platform are what determines what is subsquently met. Strictly, those who have come hold a clear relation for algorithms to suggest; moreso, are people who have been already noted as being a certain way, and so by a users perceived interests, so are such creators eligble for suggestion. "As they are the sample lot which users are pointed to." That is why niches are important, as you make yourself relevant within a certain direction, for those who, typically have such interest, and are otherwise noted by the alogrithm as having such an interest as (meta-noted) which you are a source for. Make your stamp then, as you warrant yourself the chance to be seen. 
            <br>&emsp;In that way, the core argument is one of platforms. For engagement is not itself the economic issue, but rather of exchange; which econmomics is built on. But there is little doubt or reasoning which requires regard for the profit of exchange, as the basic means can facilaite that. What matters is the engagmenent. This stands on the function of a platform, and thus the persistence of such operation. Facebook for instance, despite being around, functions quite differently than it did before; and thus the proper oblige to its system has changed. Youtube is generally what it's been, and Tik Tok also remains the same. The latter though, for instance, is rewarding longer form videos. Which is but a newer side for creators to lean on. More impprtantly though, is the longevity of Tik Tok as a platform, and whether it will remain present in our country; or at least, if so, whether it will keep to its current function.

            At the foot of society is a sort of collective commissery; namely, towards the purpose of needs and satiety. 
            <br>&emsp;Government, and custom, is that which forms around the strenght of such union, in that upon a stable conidtion of such gains, so is the binding of it admitted. You might imagine this as lonely wanderers, merging together to support the other's travel amidst the grasp for sustenance. But as enough come, or at least some reliability is gained, then like a pillar erected for stability, so around the folks surrounding doth culture and custom lay.
            <br>&emsp;Upon this point, the matters of water are attended. As food being essential, and water being randomly got, so by the settled communion --by virtue of the steadyness of food (that all to moving substance)- that so the steadyness of water lays. In a well perhaps. Better said though, around the essentials which afford a governed communio, that so are a) those essentials maintained and improved, and b) other pillars erected. For man needs more than food, but also shelter, custom, production of tools and other means. And so does a richly simple commune lay.
            <br>&emsp;As time goes on, people notice other things. As if upon the pillar of food, that means for reliable water were gained, that equal to the search and industry for that, were other things found; things which could be added or used for improvement. And by this, the ocncept of buildings came about, along with a novel dispersion of tools and goods. 
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps the space between everyone producing and buying goods, and those being made as mere tokens amidst the simple ways is unclear; for how did any have money or means of exchange for such goods? How could the labor required to extract and manufacture be ordained without compensation? Even if someone were a cobbler, a blacksmith, a watchmaker or cook, who held any means to purcahse them? The spring for economics needs more specifics.
            <br>&emsp;We can say though, in general terms, that amidst the foundational pillars of the group, new ones were laid. These amounted to advents in culture, profession, and the goods and activities that came about. As it were though, this line of development furthered to the point where points of exchange littered the land: a true economy.

        <div id="growingaim">
            I have always been happy, and aimed for it. Our life has not been but a required garnish.
            <br>&emsp;The toruble in describing this though, is that there are needs, and beyond your simplicity, so are you without a grip on such things, out of control: for you either freeze, or seep the warth from another.
            <br>&emsp;In that I can say, or at least I could recount, the choices I've made. But right now, all I see, is that even if I were to garner some stability, that happiness would be my sight. For the thing I know, is that such goods are all you do, or ever will seek. For it is what remarks the stride of our moment; and by that, the warmth which your life brings for. This is why, when we are sapped from heat, we dream and amend for such success. But the happiness we see is really one of imagery and pursuit, rather than experience. I would not say the things we anticipate are poor in making us happy; only that their worth is in the happiness ahead, rather than the passion your feeling now. 
            <br>&emsp;This is where I lie then. For much of what I feel makes me happy is not, on inspection, much different than what I can imagine. Foremost, is that the giddy excitement I have of some exocitc end, is not of more worth than the actual end is concerned. And the thing we forget, is much of our pleasure comes from the sight of such experience, rather than what it will actuallly confer. For I too feel myself setting sights on things, feeling elated; and otherwise relishing the fact that of such fancied sights, we can see. And our depression comes when such sights are gone. 
            <br>&emsp;It is all so important though, that what we care for now, is in many ways what the future is promsied on. Only, the character of it changes it's hue, thus drawing our passion towards something so apparently vibrant. But the fact is, that the granduer of that image draws us more now, than it would during the moment. Better put, and my point, that the good from that experience is so on the balance of its elements: but such a balance is not what we imbued with on approach; for in that, the very idea of something is what energizes us, and our view is whats pleasant. That, and the very prescence of a view, affords us a sort of barrier from depression and apprehension.
            <br>&emsp;My point then is one of wisdom. As the good that our view brings, to me, seems not what the present will then be. For you will be there, having to experience things. Indeed there may be a arrangment of work and feed which allows for enjoyment. 
            <br>&emsp;I just don't value much on the promise of things. For I don't feel that the present is lacking those things, but rather a harmony with what is available. I think we forget a) the work required to reach our dream, b) the continued maintence of it, and c) the value of it once it becomes something were apart of, and d) once it's over, we simply dream of more, or settle ourselves in, and be happy as our fortune permitts. And this latter, to me, is not to be averse to. But I think it is essentially on par with what you can currently be.
            <br>&emsp;Our approach in life has been such, that of one, we at one point withdrew. And from there, assimilated to a purely happy being. Here the tits and tats of leisure came to brew, along with the bones of self-regard, and the cheer from our world view, and seeing her grain and hues. It has been like a grove, where the leaves were shining, or paled with blue icy frost. And the sun, always setting, to a moon which comes to rise. Nor the birds mellodies amidst the heat and wind, or the flushings of a squirell. The grass is soft, and there are slopes which give a slant view of the lands and sky. And indeed, though we must treat it, is there shelter, full of satiable and crafy ends. Theres not but peace and prosperity here. Though we do spend a bit to much time in the surrounding forest.
            <br>&emsp;And so now, I feel on the backs of tradition, and otherwise set to relieve this gasp for breathe which comes ever so often. I don't wish to put myself in this place, nor do I want to avoid the drip in our comfort which comes from ordaining another. But I have, in our fortune and dubious ways, founded a mine of calm delight and joy. And our sights ahead, as the sap of comfort compells me, is not to a new mine, but merely an array of motions --be it expanding or stabilizing-- that surround the current spring. It needs but additions, in both the rafters and company. For I don't truly consent, nor admire, the fancied elation to adventure, infamy, posterity, and gain. These are but the prospects of one unfamiliar which the dearer portions of nature. Things of which don't linger in their good upon completion; but instead draw more.
        </div>
        <div id="calmhope">
            The oddest force in the world is money, as you must work for it. Nor do things worth buying come cheap. And even if you could afford it, there's not much in a single experience, but one whose pleasure extends through your life; and as such, you ought procure money consistently, as to purchase things often.
            <br>&emsp;But the thing I find is that such hopes are built on rickety foundations. Simply, when we are lacking, we dream, and by that, find passion in things which can bring us there. This is from an ungrounded or satisfied customer though. And in effect, wisdom fairly suggests, that upon realizing your hope, that you will simply wish for more. Mainly in part, because of the thing you seek being a mere experience, or some preferred ordinance in your living: the highest being king. 
            <br>&emsp;These do not prolong your experience though from the moments invovled, but only the search, your grasp, your success and achievment. But where does happiness lie if not in the living? Dreams seem but an antidote to a current lack of happiness. The principle though is that what strikes you about your discontent, will not bring you content upon arrival. For the candour of what you seek is that it is opposite of where your currently at; and the contrast brings your gaze to some brighter horizon: the peering of which, marks your passion and claim. But not what actually lies at it's edge: for you must actually do as living requires, and that which offers content. Or you will simply seek more.
            <br>&emsp;This discretion, or prediction rather, is merely here as an admission to our cares within living, and of finance. For if I had all the money in the world, I would go to India, Bengal, China, and perhaps the richer parts of London. But these hopes are but tingling inclinations, buzzing from dreams of the past. Indeed they never come to fruition, as either aims or the according resolves; but their moments do leave a sort of lint, and carry thus their seeking smell. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, I would rather clean these off, then have to humour them as part of our amends. For they remark what I would call 'an idle state'; one of which, fairly by nature's demands, and less so by our fiddling oblige, comes from our sedition to dutiful ware and monotony: whereupon we tiredly dream, 'for who wishes to be so tired and stuck, and set in it'. 
            <br>&emsp;As it were, my interests are grounded from self-observation, and the similar dualism to nature's claim; whereby we hold the elements of amends based on our propiety, and those of reward. This is but a root though, a sort of personal bank of pleasure and security. For we are a man, and by that subject to the world. Only, our intent is not to fancy our unbridled inclinations --to Bengal. As mentioend, these are from an instable state; and not likely absent if our personal bank is empty. For we may be nieve in our surface level ways; or we may be puffed up from our youth, or simply with angst in our less than glorious positio. There are an assortment of ways as to why we dream, and proceed either with confidence or angst. Wisdom, though not with disdain, merely remarks what's vain about this.
            <br>&emsp;In many ways, I ought balance our current wares with that which is expected of me. For our civil state is such that little is needed: but some still. And so our abscence of much bears disharmony. Per tradition though, we are not so needing of parlay. For we may wish for chidlren, in a predictable sense; and that of partners and friends, etc. But our distance from these things is like one's seperation from political contribution, or cultural definement. These are the seeds which get blown upon a blossomed spore: and by that, a prominent man. "To much do I see a prevalance of the former, without the traits of the latter. Or, if those traits are prevalant, their to fixated and focused, and lacking of the effortless charm which a lush prominence produces." Family is equal, in that, less you seek meaning, or feel compelled based on reaching now which is eventual, then so are you actually preparing, or on approach to such eventuality, by the natural rise of your prevalcne and character. And as the world heeds your offer, so doth that of one whose hand you take: and to those you tend to. "It is a fine principle to state, that of such attention, ought I have it in both quality and extent."
            <br>&emsp;In all of this then, there lies the things I find dear, and those which we'd describe as part of our life. The former has been spoken of for years, and the reason for our prominence in such regard, is also its own line of reflection. Where our life has struggle though, is in the strucutral side of things. Our invovlements, friends, genuine contirbution. These things have garnished my efforts for an age it seems. And never, beyond the insight of failure, have I succeeded. It is true that our cares and attempts were off tiler; likely because our pivot point was from deep within. Indeed experience has shown me how to be from that base; nor is it without much strenght to try something new. For I can almsot mold what seems uncertain, with similar portions and light as those which I now see. 
            <br>&emsp;Plainly speaking, I wish for some friends. Perhaps they will not share our care for personal reason and reward; but so in our leisure can we compare. Near this is public invovlment, namely that of recreation. In these, we bear the benefit of itinerary, speaking, vulnerability, along with social potential as pertains romance, partners, relationships and friends. Indeed, having a job fixates me and thus draws me to these ends. It is also benefited by doing them. Similarly, finding other means to communicate, be it on forums or specilaized sites, can offer an equal amount of relief and attention, like recreation. As such, these elements orbit eachother, and afford one another harmony;  in that by being there, each is able to accept the requirments for itself, lean in as to exhibit committment and the according stability, along with a sort of pleasure, in that each can happily see the point it provides: and of this, others offer, in that they bolster the ware and tear of those around, and at the very least allow them to make their point, and relish it. Nor is the fact that such point becomes easier and rewarding a lesser remark.
            <br>&emsp;As we said, our fears are not such as tradition would see me; nor are our visions of grandeur and reprieve either prominent or consented. But our life is on track for something. Even if it is more moderate, and not dissproprtiante as our visions concieve. By that, I simply wish to correspond with our Sums. The folks to which I'd share are clear, and equally relevant to the sentiment I'd express; and that which I would express is concrete. Our writing compares, though is less definite. And, in propiety, our interest and contribution are heralded here, as we may simply offer a modern take on the mind, God, death and morality. This indeed is our great painting; one of which our current portraits relate. Our children are similar, in that they are the offspring of our current attentions, be it ourself, a job, a partner, a friend. 
            <br>&emsp;I will submitt that our idea of contribution is warped by a fractured view of the world; notably born from TV and screen time. These things just melt my mind; and even as the years have gone on, and as a source of refutation and validation, our otherwise impressions still leave me irriated by what I see on TV. And as so, our common remark is that when our view of the world is guided by study and experience, so is there not what we gleam from TV. But when we do watch it, our fears and elation are instated; and so our duty and oppertunity consent. In that, all I can say, is this very fact of confusion and display from the televised culuture,  moves me to offer some truth, or deep expression. There is room for this, and indeed I find it fufilling. In the same way as one paints about death as to remark there grasp of it, so is our wish and or incline to be on TV, or express ourselves publlicily, an equal amned, in that we grasp our feeling of the world. But the world does not strike me as needing change; as death does not spurr in you a wish to alter it, but mend to it. I think that a better way of viewing this, is that as death is there, so is the world. And by not expressing ourselves, be it through writing or expression, we get weighed down by it: as some feel in there grief about death. And the side of our world view which is subject to colorfull expression, only unerves our insecure state. "While one's fear of death is not prodded by others expression."  As such, I'd say there an educational offer one could make as to afford the ease from expression, and the fair impression to others. Different to this is the need to express as to remove your irriation: whereby we similarly refuted other's view of death and validated our own. Only, in that case, it being so private, meant the proper course was one which remarked your own.  The world is not so different; in that, of death, despite us dealing with it all, that so is the primary force one which remarks your experience with it: and to that, your reflecting amends. To the world then, ought we proceed positively, as if we are tailoring our own needs. Truly we could iron this sentiment out, but I'd say for the moment, the idea that we'd share as to sturdy ourself, and in by that happily effect others by impressing upon them our pure expression, makes the affair both personally and publicly satisfying.
            <br>&emsp;Last in our remarks are the matters of work and correspondance. As the world draws me to express myself, like the force of death, so am I compelled to submitt what I write; as such words are a summary of my dealings with life, and thus expressing them feels formitative. Whereto I do not know. And Indeed, there seems a difference between the mere message I'd send to a professor or forum; and that which I actually procure, like Descartes and Kant. I don't mean to be a writer though, like Rousseua; or Hume even. Indeed, I might benefit an acquaintence with something similar to forums, but in a more concise format for essays. Still, I wonder if our thoughts are better kept as written, and not constructed as those submissions would need. Per the future, I would format my words as to be readable and seen: and in that declarative. Nor would the clearer ideas of Sums be in need of much more than demonstration. But my doubts of death and God seem but private triflings. And easily so; for the wear upon our life draws these mentions out, but the deepness where they lie, and the ripples which the surface elicits. But our steadyness lets me be pleased with said things dear. As remarks work, so is this simple, yet complicated due to aims. For the matter at hand, we are talking about some sort of profession or skill, and all for the sake of money. Only, as my dear efforts get ruffled by surface tension, so does our care and aim for work get rippled by fear and desire. And, as I sit with a clear head and course for action, so do the lingering threads of those sentiments blurr our otherwise content. "Why are you choosing this I say? You won't earn glory, fame nor the means to travel." When this conflict comes up, the work at hand feels more like a burden then satiation; as we feel drawn to do more, and thus the current post is both limiting, and a cost of effort while we work for something more. And the whole venture feels like a drag. In the sense of expression though, you may seek to create content, or be invovled publicly through forms of media. And by that, per our course, so may our skills and invovlement lie. The question though, is whether we learn a skill to leverage, or amend to a path which affords skills and oppertunity; one being short term, the other long. 
            <br>&emsp;What I want is perhaps the mitigating factor. For working little is enough, and sufficeint for what is near and plenty. But, novelly, or of passion, I may seek travel, be it domestic or far. That, and a more plump and ordinate means for living holds itself some favor. In part though, if I remove the harsher sides of fear and delight, then I am left with what could reasonably be, and fairly beyond; but by means which I cannot see. Seemingly, our buiness is a sure curator of such goods, but in correspondance with it's success: and as such, its exhibition of success as a buiness: by which, as one, we must neccessarily amend. Skills may be otherwise garnished, or novel employments; which may be found through simple oppertunity and positions, or by some eligble offer and training. This seems to benefit only the conduct of our work, not its privilage. For if I did go to Thailand, the Atlantic, so would I need a reliable means; and one which I'd be fine doing. So experience is required to secure a familiar standinbg amidst online labours. As regards craft though, besides creation, there is the old way of education. I see much beneift in having a bachelor, as you can simply write. And earning so can likely be done cheaply and swiftly online: but the three year committment is hard. As it were, diplomas and certificates hold no clear route to income. They may afford potential, but no direct eligibility, and thus privalage. Online training seems fair, though the balance of skill and community seems split; in that for one the means are cheap, the other expensive; but of the former, it is unneccessary to have the format which affords the latter: but so are you left with the abscence of what said latter would provide. It  is not entirely true that to find that community that you'd have to pay; but there is much of it which you do, and the value is merely there for such effect. Moreover, the less direct you are in the community, means that you need to be more impressive to enter it; which requires creation, rather than skill. If you simply have that, then you are left with a wrench and no client, nor means to attract other workers. Balancing this with broader skills, and potential variety in oppertunity, does afford some reason to invest. But perhaps each scenario is unique, and as regards its price and value, ought you merely be open and curious, as to find, consider and see. All the while, noting your interest, in that you could work online, with a team, for creation and the good; and through that, by the means of video, audio, graphics, color and design, along with Javascript, media management, SEO. "The oppertunity will be in a company or team looking to hire, based on skill and specific ability; such as moderate means in Javascript, as to clean a website: a digital clerk of sorts. Or to actually perform a task, such as edit a video, or create some flyer. That, or to work on a team as an editor."

            For many reasons, our interest in success is dampened by our happiness and stress. For we can't really see ahead; or we simply dream. But as for action, we tend to get riled up, as if our state in life is probing us to do something rewarding. In the moment were drawn, and can see how well we'll do, and the objects which our success is born from. 
            <br>&emsp;As I settle though, and our happiness comes to be, and our fears flatten out, then so are we in a less elated state. And our view of success is less defined in it's means and ends. As such, our idea of the things we'd do to succeed, hold less promise or confidence; in part, because our view of the end, and the passion stirred in me, don't draw out the view of the means, as to be broader in its form: and thereby evaluated on the way it is at heart, rather than its near and discrete proportions. 
            <br>&emsp;Where I land then, is that from our experience, this part of the path were on is one that either turns away --settling into the content we have-- or proceeds for elaboration of that happiness; but in that, focuses little on the fertility of the project itself. Rather, it tends to be consented to if the form of it is sufficeint, as to afford our creativity and solid base: but not one which is overly attractive and dazzling: which is to say, 'it need not be as a project would want, if it were meant to yield us success, but simply what our generoisity can work from'. 
            <br>&emsp;Right now I am in that state, where we are too happy to care, but inclined also by the sense of duty ahead, and our worth from doing so; and the desired relief from such duty, and its spurr of richer amends. But such amends are not so enticing when are need for them is meager. What I will say, is that in this current rendition of future regard, we are higher than we were before. And as the wave of interest ebbs from passion to past times, so is the bobbing nature of the latter of a relatively complex sort. Or, in short, what is sufficient for creativity is in fact dazzling. Though, when I look at our work, I am not so dazzled, but merely impresed by the strenght of our elements. But little of its excites me, as even the simplest complexion would in a passioned state. So there is a natural flattens to our confidence. Even then, I still recognize the wholenss of our work, and its fit for broad appeal. Theres no heat to this recognition, but as our wave of content bobbs upward, so is our novel desire enstated. "For what, I do not know, but of the basis, as would serve our ordinary worth, and the bobbing fancy to make it something more, for the further gleams of fame, or the nearer wants of reward, so are in total drawn."
            <br>&emsp;I wonder though what such a venture would be. For the marks of elation are quite easy to make, as all seems good when the future seems so clear and prized. "For we will no matter the route make it." But, even if in our relativley solid contentment, and the more faded view of our work, so am I more inclined to see a reason to do it; and by that reason, form our brand and title. For it would be easy to say 'dailyTips' or 'GreensTavern'. Something quick, impersonal and catchy. Then there is another, where we say something personal, overt and obscure, like 'TheMason', 'GreensBounty' or 'JoyWantWonder'; something which was meaningfull to me, and esteemed as something which only those in the group would know. Somewhere in the middle though, there is the remarks of reason and living, along with the nature of this being a channel, with a form and some guided plea for other's attention: something which demonstrates what one could expect, in both the routineliness of our content --hence DailyTips-- and the material of that --be it misties cooking recipes, or Dons sports talk.

            I write so much, for our choices have to led to vulnerabilites as it pertains to sentiment. 
            <br>&emsp;For our amends in  life have been such, that our path for action has changed direction. And from there, a balance of interest and duty was made. But so  was the former given more prevalance, and often at the begudgement of the latter. But so did we acqueise to it, and find reaosn and worth in it.
            <br>&emsp;But as time went on, we were to keen to leave it; either out of relief, or by some oppertunity to do so. And now, when we have nothing, nor the means to find it, were somewhat stuck.
            <br>&emsp;I would say that snetiment attrats upon you via a restless state; in that those who would deem you as unworthy and need if discontent, merely do so in a pointed way: which gets flared up by your actions.
            <br>&emsp;For perhaps their view is ruffled, and thus they forget the past, and fear the future: and judge you accordingly. But as time goes on, and your response to their treatment is  affible, then despite not filling their wish, so are the senitments cooled, leaving not but practicality.
            <br>&emsp;I don't think I have an understanding, which would afford mere allowance for easy progress. But there is room for me to try, whiff, and merely proceed. For that, we have oppertunities: but they are not final. Nor are there many routes with clear paths to them. But we are not so averse to trying, or seeing them.
            <br>&emsp;One of the great assurances, is that where we mean to go, which is all that matters beyond our current vagrance and communion, that such a place has a variety of means, each surrounding one another, and by that, offering potential changes for the sake of preference. As I see now though, it is hard to image about such potential, when you have nothing for now. The point, is that despite a future with ideals, so do you need somewhere to be, however unideal. And indeed, what would be permissible in that is quite broad, and there are options. But time and direct effort seem the only promsing means. For everything else seems blown into the wind. I can widen our search; but really to things which you can be direct about. Emails are always preferable, as is anything which you can communicate directly. But for now, we only have two walmarts and Superstore, each of which seems likely, if not promising. And per the holiday, we need only tenure our family sentiment, remain open ourselves; but thereby remain upright, live, be.

            So just a few remarks, coming primnarily from a talk on Hume. Namely, that in terms of formal reasoning, ie. logic and math, or better yet propositions, there is not requirment, or fair expectation, that anything within said phrases ought actually exist. You may have three connected points; and it may be demonstrated that the angles are always 180<br>&emsp;. Better yet, considering a set of conditions, you may deduce much from them: but that the objects which we are speaking of, with such conditions, do not neccesarily exist. There may be no triangles; or things with that relation. The propositions are merely formal and or abstract. One may ask how we get the elements to use in the propositions; and in terms of mathematics, the buisness is seperate from other objective matters; in the sense that, of a bachelor, who is so if they are umarried, that so may there not be someone who we'd describe as such. The question though, is despite there being no one who meets that condition, has there never been? And if so, how can we make such a conditional statement, considering that the subject of the statement is supposedly unexistant. Similar to math, whereby we attribute values and relate upon them, that the idea of a bachelor is used upon the value of a person; meaning some generic and or abstract object of that kind; a kind which can be more or less dervied from the experience we have with it. But we might then as easily say, that a person who is 8ft tall will never exist; and we surley haven't seen one, but the reasoning perhaps for the logic does not require that we do. The reasoning may be strong, but in a formal sense, hinges little on whether an actual person has or will be of such condition. In some sense this is the question, for the meaning of a statement tends to come from its place in the world; and thereby it's impact upon us, had we listened to it. But such an amends usually comes when the statements are based in, and spring us to action, via matters of fact. For if a person cannot be a certain height by the impermissibility of nature, then so is this logical reasoning quite obsucre from matters of fact. Both in the form of the proposition, in that the grounds for it are not (we'll say) based on matters of fact, but mere qualities which bear themselves as possible via the physics of being, 'anot not so much what an actual person is'; as well as the real results of the statement, that they'd be more than merely valid, but true, or real rather. 
            <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is wondering why knowledge is of worth? It would seem that my inclinations for it come from similar source which inclines me to more apparnetly deisrable things. Not so much that my taste for sweets sits alongside a similar pallete for insight, but rather, in my remarks at least, as I'd suggest my interest in such common desires, that so would I say that I seek things from knowledge.
            <br>&emsp;But in fact, I do not know what I seek, for the basis for what I would, is not something that really serves me. At least, in a modern sense, what I can not attribute to higher motions, or functionings rather at the surface of nature, that so in those deeper sways --where real knowledge lies-- so is our abscence from it without ware and concern; nor is the prescence of it much consolation. As my fears and deeds tend to come from observation and experience. And much of what I see in myself, combined with the collective insight of the man, brings little care in me for things that knowledge is traditionally sought for. My mind is not some seperate entity, and a mystery at that; nor is death some experience which has any reason to be feared of; rather the notion of soul, and afterlife, are but the ends which death is proposed to be an entry to: and of such ride, I do not think much of the facts which describe it, nor is it one which sallies the natural content I have in death. 
            <br>&emsp;In whole, there are many of us who act with a sort of unity; but also perhaps, with an eventual forward bend, as what you propsed as true, and acted by as if you knew, becomes less taughitble, and the concreteness of your  view gives way to a glaring need for change. "And immaleability feels the weight as it is asked to reposition." As such, there has been a history of denial, formalism, scrutiny, and otherwise complacency when liberty is in fact present. For all I seek is to live in a way, that my labors and delights are tended to. This is almost in line with my peacefull grace while respirating, and uncontrolable gasp when there is no air. That as such, so do I honestly remark about the quality of my experience. And in that, lies what is best described as a sort of liberty, in that I can either act or suggest something which is out of the norm. When I do so though, and feel the heat from standards, so do I a) refute those standards, so I may look forward without being pulled from behind, or b) state my own standards, as to cement myself ahead on the new path we've found, and it's end which were on route to. "You can't simply deny the false beliefs of others, but find one's which are true. And indeed, the orthodoxy of those falisites can interfer with your interest in finding better ones; and like a sickness which would cloud the eagerness and ability of our mind (to wonder and pursue), that so is the removal of friction a similar thing: at  least in this we are dealing with it with the medicine of defiance and rebuke."
            <br>&emsp;In many ways, I see that our life as beings, is best described by conditioning. For things which act in a system, and in fairly complex ways, hold but a mere banking towards certain motions; but in the composition of there being, as oppsed to the fairly straighforward motion of a particle, there lies a medley of particular motions; each pointing as direct as the other, or any finer piece for that matter; but by there orientation into a objective system, so do the composed motions, or unified sum if you will, resemble that of gravitation, whereby the attraction of 2 piepces is merely the same as an indivuidal, but being exerted by two indidivuals. Ie. the effect is in the portions: but where lie together, merely exhibits that portion in a larger way, via union, or rather combination. As for the reason  that things exert what they do, and are in the combinations that we see, it is whole and fair to suspect that, beneath this apparent complexity, there lies a deep abyss of simple homogenity. Even though the truth in the matter is unknown, that so is it a fine principle that, despite this deep comparability, that there is in fact no isotropy; and that it is more likely the matter that, of that deep and rising tide, that the meagerest of differences eventually compounded into the complexiites we see. One might view this as a one mile pole which slightly started to unwind, and near the top, exponentially loosened and strung apart. The illustration though, is one that is better viewed like a tree, in that the rise of comparability reached a point where the differentation merely broadened after a long period of time, and in a hasty manner. I'd fair this concept is not to hard to see, even if my explanation is a little parched.

            So I sit here, fine, free, and more or less happy. I contend to the environment around, and our personal position with respect to it. But this is not something for me to run to, but assimilate in terms of something deeper. For if someone tells you to grow up and focus on your life, then lists what such would amount to, regardless of the merrit in those suggestions, ought you still focus on your life. In that, reckon the importance of your life, and if the way you ought live it is unclear, then find out. But if your waiting, then your never going to feel set, or accepted.
            <br>&emsp;In many ways, my dearest consent is to that of a family. I just can't imagine that we won't someday have one. Considering our time a decade ago, I can only imagine where we'll be another from here. And so it being eventual is not some derailing factor the present, or anything seemingly nearer. But there ought be a path. For we may find personal privation and amends fulfilling, but they will not bring you to that final place. And so, for your own sake, and that of what lies ahead, ought we live further and more meaningfully.
            <br>&emsp;Where life lies in a balance of regard, whereby we remark our choices thus far, and the potential which lies ahead; and then the future which we see from a point we'd already describe as happy, wherein the path ahead is not one where we'd now try and succeed, and thus have the promise at hand, but rather a sight to what it all means: as if we'd already won. For it is easy to admitt your mistakes,  or at least recognize where your at, and which choices could afford promise. It is another to see, beyond practical insight, what lies in terms of your life entirely. 
            <br>&emsp;We sit then as one already pleased, and quite content. But when we are sprung to regard the future, by virtue of our instability in the present, I see but the little awkwardness which our choices have earned us so far, and what we could then do to amend. And indeed, the sight of this, however near, still fills me with a sense of grounding, and by that a blend of delight and apprehension. Perhaps, from these feelings, lies the sense of what is beyond, as if to fixate the draw the nearby future has. Only, I'd remark that as our current stability is not as tilted, and we retain the insight of the future, while being as pleased as we were, so are we left with a contented view of the future; and in that, a brodaer regard for it. "It is as if we were asked to solve a problem, and upon doing so, we learned about the nature of said problem and said solutions; but in the process, the issue lost it's effect, and thus laid there as a drifting regard for the time ahead: while we sat and rested. Only, our mind is still sat forward, and our contentment isn't one of stability, but time."

            Continetal philosophy traps itself in the process of identifying things seemingly external, via internal sense. For their being so unque, or external, adds a sort of property to what we'd otherwise see it to be: for we are internally seeing it, and thus, via the means of such sense, that the absolute view of something is from our internal conception: yet what then are we seeing, if not the non external, yet 'impressed' view?
            <br>&emsp;For me, this affords me a sort of inquiry which I'd described as 'contintla progression'. Simply, we live as though the ontology and being of things is paramoubt, and observation is but a resemblence of something truer:  the actuality of possibility. But, when we ultimately designtae our impressions as seomthing seperate and dsintxinte from what we see, then so are we cutting ourselves off from the knoweldge which inquiry brings. Simply, concern your senses as equal to and on par with the objects you see; and remark on them as interactions within a total system: your impression being a term of that. In that, ought we simply be in the neccessary state of progress and inquiry, as to understand all, when there appears so much mystery and difference, yet, less we are of mind, then all is ultiatmely the same. "And inquriy allows us to remove the blockiness of this paradox"
        </div>
        <div id="meanstogrow">
            As it were, I have a progressive model. Fundemntally, it believes that all phenomena can be explained by the motions of existence, but describing this is both troublesome and obsucre. 
            <br>&emsp;For one, the basis of such statement needs subjects, or objects rather, to be used as parts of the motion. For we are stuck otherwise in a dialectic, whereby our inability to identify one thing, leads us to remarking upon an entire whole.
            <br>&emsp;And indeed, breaking the barrier of this obscurity surrounds the goal of our inquiry. For if we are left with a proper sense of how things appear distinct, yet act in a unified way, then our proposition will be sound. "The way to think of it is in a sheet of fabric, whereby it is all stitched together, and by that, entirely bound. There may be linens though, or fibres. And the polishing of regard we need, is to not run the latter notion into an infinitely plural/piecemeal notion, nor an entirely whole fabric notion." 
            <br>&emsp;The strong sense I have, is that the fabric is more or less whole, but is able to fold whilst retaining substance. And via its ripples, so do complexities lay. The question though, is why it folds as it does; and not just in general, but particular to each point? At least, the apparent distinctions of things, in terms of either properties or localle, suggests some non-uniformity, or isotropy rather, in the spurr for being. 
            <br>&emsp;No matter, our idea of this is beyond the current remarks in physics. It is true that such regards could better really explain the esscence of waves and thermodynamics, and in that, diffuse even the basest of reasons to explore further. "Indeed my need of consolation is already whithered away." But I can't help but remark that our current views on things, and the clarity we seek, is still apt to linger past the surest contentment with our physical view. For I do not know God, nor death, or mind, nor living. And despite there being little which our explanations cannot afford, so is there still an ambiguity, or disregard, for being on the whole; and by that, there seems little grounds for imploring views that run contrary to how those subjects are traditionally seemed.
            <br>&emsp;By that though, it pays  an arm and leg to understand the process by which said things are viewed. Namley in the form of propositions. Here deduction lies, but not so by conditions, or laws, but rather principle, or neccessity. 
            <br>&emsp;And indeed, the progressive model is one that means to ask questions, and by that, assume less certainty than the proponents of something absolute; all the while we establish boundries, as to at least know, within all fairness, how something is with respect to what we already know. 
            <br>&emsp;And all inquiry is, is in establishing the simplicity of those boundries.
        </div>
        <div id="firstsight">
            So when we were young, we found little interest or reason to strive; nor was it too pleasing or healthy to smoke and slouch. 
            <br>&emsp;But in our resolve, we left for certain matters whch truly drew our mind. Only, the motivation against the opposite was not clear. For we felt principally off while in college; and our health during couriering was strict. But I recall seeking a better job, and being excited. Perhaps, if memory serves me right, we were sitting in our car, considering whether we wanted the new job, or if we would stop, and more or less priotize ourself, and some effort with Justin. I choose the latter.
            <br>&emsp;And from there our entire life changed. For we stopped worrying about schooling, nor were we fraternizing with destruction. Rather, we focused on ourself, and in a relatively strict and vehement way. 
            <br>&emsp;Doing so felt like a sort of condition, as if we were ordained the constance of attention. I recall telling my parents that I would forever live at home; and by that point, five years ahead seemed like an eternal abyss. And our sentiment was that we were going to reach such end. I remember trying to convince them, by saying we'd watch house, write, read things of the eastern sort. And there wasn't much resistance to what I said. Not very much understanding surely, but no conditions on our intent.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, we sat on the back deck, during the final days of the warm sky. And I recall sitting in a lawn chair, looking up at the blue, and feeling a sort of dried air inside me; but in that, a sort of harmony, unity, a sense of proper living. This moment was not rich in the ways that our later years would be, but the form was comparable. 
            <br>&emsp;It was not till we moved to Coquitlam that I referred to such sentiments, namely the mind and the self --while reading Osho. In that, I became incredibly aware of the portion  of me which exhibited desired, want, and ego; and the other which expressed integrity, strenght, ourself. "Left for the latter, right for the former." 
            <br>&emsp;It was only till the year after that this complexion turned to real things; as if  I had discovered the measure of experience, and only had to appropriate our actions to things as to produce such experiences. In many ways, our life has not left this motion, differing only in the  extent of our observations, and choices subsquently made.
            <br>&emsp;Right now, we are feeling the abscence of things, which would normally ground me, and allow me to be who I uniquley am. As it is hard to converse and say that you are not working, going to school, in a relationship. "Imagine if they knew how much time I put into defining friends, and chilrden: or death."
        </div>
        <div id="aneasierview">
            It seems the right thing is to properly be. Our definitions though of what this entails holds the line of differnece. For some rest on the laurels of logic, and use concepts and abstractions to weave a perfect harmony. While others refute this, saying that the properties of said concepts are not representative to the world. Those who say otherwise, then refute the emperical basis of such critiques, citing the inability to know anything truly via the senses. 
            <br>&emsp;There is a loose thread though, in that the alterante truth which we can know is deemed to be from our mind, or that which we can truly attest. And in effect, there lies a very blank page of reason;  a sort of pointed medley of principles and doctrines: all void of everyday matter. "But then applied to it, as if it were a scale."
            <br>&emsp;The primary concern in all  of this is that the lineage of this thinking has produced a sort of pessimistic view of anything alteranative. How could there not be some eternal good, some sort of animating spirit which brought things to accord; but also a will within man, as to permitt his rightous  obediance to such good, and thus make him moral: for what else permitts, or brings one forward in and through the concept of eternity. 
            <br>&emsp;The issue though is that the contrast to this sense is not well defined. For beyond the complexion of each side, the former is still endowed with the musts of logic. For it is true, that if there were a good, and a will, that so would the latter be proper upon its alignment with the former. But who says there is anything of the sort? It is true that the conception of nature holds some mystery, and by that, it is concievable that our baser views of her permitt the streams of abstractions to be.  But the plea for there to be so feels unfounded. 
            <br>&emsp;In short, there is the matter of truth, which in the common sense, is undiscovered. But so lies sentiment, or one's reasoning as a motive to produce an end which seems conducive to the proprted view of nature. And I would say that the abstract view of nature has no reason to be so, less we believe that an alternative is poor. But the definition of an alertanative, where there is no logical basis for things, but merely the arrangment of nature thus far, is one that holds room and plenty, through living and death. 
            <br>&emsp;As an appeal to Hume, our wishes are ingrained to the elements of the world, and find their preference in real things. Nor is it fair to suggest that the form of those senses, or linens stained by the world, are not either a) of the world, or b) made as such as to be of a form via a relation with the world. "As in the relative motion of things, bringing mechanics to be via relations, rather than an outside force". 
            <br>&emsp;This is the problem you see. For the aim of heaven does hold a scale of morals and virtue. And from that, a measure of good behaviour. But the sentiment of heaven feels like an idea that is made via our time in existence; at the very least a concept which our struggles in existence procurrs, and nudges us to reckon, or remark. "Equal to our thoughts being compared to someone else talking."
            <br>&emsp;As a sort of progression, we may say, that in critiquing something, and stating something holder more truth, that so will the values established of that falsity be tampered with also. For if it isnot true that there is heaven, nor a lord, then so will our feelings and amends regarding that be deemed falluable. 
            <br>&emsp;My feeling, is that the abrasive response by those who deem such a criticsim as either cruel or unfounded, simply have no regard for what good there'd be in an otherwise truth. Notably, what the reality of death is, and what measure of behaviour ought there be with such truth in mind.
            <br>&emsp;In that, we can color this discoure with some finer complexion.  We are rational; at least we are capable of words and speaking. In that, the confusion of life, its tradtionall remarks, and ours current, lead us to say what we would; in that we remark upon whats been said, and what we think is worth adhering to now. In that, we are left with the mystery of how the world is; namely in the oddity of sensation and matter, considering the very diffuse form of nature.  That may be considered the micro scale question; while the macro scale is concerned with the apparent complexity of things, yet via a rather homogenous basis. Better put, the esscence of matter being solid, holds with it either a quality, or joint remark regarding relations,  namely in the differentation of substance, as not to merely hold what we deem properties of matter -- solidity, motion--- but also the distribution of it,  as the apparent complexity of the world seems to come from. 
            <br>&emsp;The mystery most personal to us is sensation; the defintiion of which would surely eradicate any archaic mention of mind.  Just as the idea of solidity is but an aggregate of something smaller and not so solid, so does sensation lay; in that by the relation of things, so do we have such experience; but the actual experience itself, whereby we are aware of the sensation, and by that privy to its result (pain), that so is our awareness of an equal granularity as the stimuli reception. For instance, light is not but a certain ripple, and it wofts over to us after bouncing off something; and because we see so many of those wofts, there is a composition.  In terms of perception, and its form, it seems right to say, in a non dual sense, that each point of stimuli is received by a particualr appartus: a point if you will. And the hypothesis is that there are as many apparti as there are points of the composition.  Also possible is that the resolutiion of our vision is  perhaps not so granular, but full of larger portions which have there own correspondingly large apparati. "Somewhere in the middle, lies the batchings of discrete stimuli, with batches of discrete apparati, which form a less diffuse image: as if this section of apparati formed this portion of the input. Together, the composition may in fact be full of many large pieces, as we'd deem; while the actually mechanism is in fact more diffuse, but arranged into higher order. As if there were the provinces of an impression which we were aware of, but the actual making of such portions (and thus pieces of the whole) were made from the municipalities. "

            So, the care one has in where they live, is not but a range of practical limits, prosperous wonder, a hint of hope, and a realistic chance of nicer scenery.
            <br>&emsp;At it's core, all is the same, varying only in complexin. And indeed, the brighter side of our efforts is aimed at seeing further sides; or different ones. 
            <br>&emsp;But while we may be resting ourselves, or procurring some meaningfull end, so are we obliged to the lands around; in terms of where we'll walk, what we'll see, the literal crust of our existence.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, most places fair best when they have views of the sky or mountains. Distance being a mere scaling factor to this. For being near a mountain does not offer a lingering breadth to it; nor does being far away hold much notice. The sky is not esteemed based on its height, but rather the scope of your view. So if there are trees in the way, or rises in land or residence, then you may see little, in terms of width and depth. And indeed mountains and the sky blend nicely when the right viewport and distance is held. But both can be appreciated on their own. A mere hill will always offer some sight of the sky. Nor will flatlands offer little near residences, and especially not amidst the more open stretches of land. Mountains tend to be tricky to see; for unless a road is wide or bare of trees, then only in the center lane can you see what lies yonder. There are paths though and rear allies which can afford a direct line of sight. But foremost, is a park mans friend here. As the more open land there is, particularly when there is a height above the tree/house line, then the relative peak of the mountains will stand out. And indeed, open lands may fair these sights with ease, differing only in the flat spot you view from: which is not always as nice. To note, that being higher up in general will give a better view of the sky. For the better parts of the day are the quick moments from sunset to dusk, where the melting yellow mixes with the darkening hues: making a rich and velvety blue. This can be seen better from higher up. Though, distance does benefit one's view of such things, as you can see a the broader scopes of the gradient. But with an untrained eye, or squinting stance, the bulk of the colors may blend together. 
            <br>&emsp;In that, you generally have two aspects to living. One regards walking, the other riding. For the first, you are benefited greatly by a grid system; as your medley of strolls will have more variation in terms of routes, rather than relying simply on changes of direction. Parks are God's proof here, as resting amidst a walk is amongst the best feelings, and of a nourishing sort. "Reading a book in these instances is likely my favority thing." But one need not rely on local livnig to enjoy themselves, or find activity. With the advent of scooters, one may evenly ride to nearby points of interest; be it for a view, a rest, or a mere bound around. Whereas our walks extend to the roads nearby, and on occasion to the edge of the neighbourhood, so can riding take us through town, and far parts of the land at that. Combined with transit, you can go to a whole new world. From that, the everyday things you see and care for, have little gems from intersperced sights; along with occasional gems of far views following travels to esteemed spots. This gives an appreciated volume to our daily movement. "For it can be all to troublesome to either need some marvel, or fetter or not having one; or to unervingly go to one."

        <div id="theroadsofar">
            So we are of the Green family. And for many years, I have been cushioned by our welcoming of our parents generoisity, and the corresponding positivty which we've incresinlgy shown in such a state; to which they have further accepted me.
            <br>&emsp;But the sentiment as of late is one of stark contrast to this. For the man, Ryan, who is of the family, is not truly himself. What he lacks, or better yet, what he achieve, is one thing. But that he is essentially cultivating the softer sides of his time, and with relative angst, furthering his deeper sides, is not so redeemable or satisfying for me and my parents anymore.
            <br>&emsp;The truth in the matter is complicated. As a comprehensive review will show you a) where we are best to go towards, or what we are to relieve, and b) what I personally seek, am at liberty to care for or be content with, and otherwise seek, and see as neccessary --for which I have till this point learned.  This is generally forgotten when I recieve input from my parents; who, in all  their kindness and loving heart, bear down of the fairness of their point, and construde in a way that lacks compassion or reference to those former elements. It is, plainly, as if they wish for me to be fully be, or at least be as I currently am in an upward trajectory. But they forgo who I have become thus far; nor, of the comforts which I am now part, how they've came to be. And depsite our assumptions and complacence being in part why we are without much handle on things, so is it not from an overreaching abuse of such comforts. Time just came this way; and fairly, I was sent to so; and with a mixture of fairness and naievety, focused on the things pleasant to me, and of a dear neccessity. 
            <br>&emsp;I don't feel like the amends for broader pursuits, and foremost some stability, is ill-founded. But the balance of sentiment ought reflect current treatments, 'as if I needed such relief', and whats good long term, 'which ought hold, from the beginning, our trajectory; and upon establishment, review of our balance, and the profit ahead and or reach for sustainability'.
            <br>&emsp;At this point, a fair admission would provide some clarity. I moved up to Kamloops December of 2022. At that point, I had stabilized in Vancouver, following our families split from Pitt Meadows; and all in all, I was happy. Truly, I had made some bad choices, but there effect was not at that point weighing me down. And depsite the awkward assertions of the summer, we had more or less settled into the flow of work and living. I can't say where things would have gone, or what I would seek or see; especially considering the current state were in, and whether or not that other future would compare. But I can say, depsite not fulfilling this, that I was on route to see the good and ease in work and living. 
            <br>&emsp;But alas, I moved, and for the soul reason my dad was sick. I can account that the sentiment of this quickly died from despair, to a lingering misfortune. By the time the new year came about, our norm of being home settled in, and our day to day living occured. Our stay was in relation to our parents trip in the spring. And beyond that, we had some sense, or feeling of uncertainty, that we'd leave after the summer. By this time our dads health was not much in question, and our own life was fairly free. We wrote, made a book, made a new version of our website. We played God of War, watched the Excorcist, watched Kyle play Elden Ring. And foremost, we developed a sort of humble living; one of which was more than ever, pleased to be as was right for the present, and not but considerate, if not clear, on the nature of the future, and our all to easy oblige: to which we were fine to consent to  and later amend, and by that, live with happiness and ease: for we sought no other direction than how things would come to be.
            <br>&emsp;Past a few incidents, the summer came, and our stay was in question. There was little apprhension on my parent's side, and the thought of me staying was quite welcome. I personally saw little delight in this, as Kamloops felt confined. And as the early months of summer went on, I felt a little stale. Despite going through the motions, I felt content to stay, and transition into the fall. I can't recall when this notion came up, but our parent's planned to go to Europe the following spring; and so our stay seemd to naturally follow. Equally unsure, but the unsigned agreement was that I would stay till July; in part because another trip to visit my grandparents was happening after the return from Europe. These plans admittedly may have solidifed later in the year; but so they became. All the while beforehand, we were simply accepting our stay into the cold months; and I'd say our sense was that we'd leave in the spring. And from there the itineraries developed.
            <br>&emsp;Through the fall we picked up our pace, refurbishing our book, getting to practical state of health, and doing some of our deepest writing till that point. "Beyond light as it were." But in this stage something happened. Our sense of the future and how things would be was tampered with. You see, our idea of work and living was that, in our comfortable estate, we were good and happy to make use of it, and enjoy it in a fair and laudible way. The future would come, and we were not averse or afraid of what it did. And our transition would naturally occur. But, as one would see across the years prior, that we had a habit of siding with whats good and pleasing, for the price of waiting for those future things. And indeed, the simplicity which we had experienced with them thus far, gave me a sort of reasonable excuse to do so. But there wasn't sure fire happiness with respect to our outer regards. For we still dreamt of fame and glory, of changing things. Admittedly, this feeling had begun to flatten out when we left Pitt Meadows, but still in this current day we held the remnants of literary and romantic expextation. And indeed, this was a mark  of our naievety; but better said, a remark as to our choices, and the tone of our character and state as became of them; to which we were not so acquited or in place regarding the manners and means of friends and success. "Our relative success, near the roots of things in years prior, likely led to our complacency in how things were; but for this and that reason, we still held the remnants of dreams, which cloytered our wish for Bronte and Sums to be heralded to me." During Christmas we had a melt down; feeling the inexhaustible wait of being happy all the time, and not subsided by the imagined bond between me and Bronte, the Mason, or Shawn. These things not being there, led to a radical implosion when we weren't by our own means happy. That is the sentiment at  least. And so we felt the need to be so perfect, that the slightest request to not do so felt unerving and drastic. So, at Christmas, when dinner and festivities were lauded without care, so were we averse, and unable to appreciate any of it. And as it were, we cried out that we'd made a mistake. By my counts, the feeling was that we had been living as though things would come for the better;  and such sentiments were cushioning the less than outward nature of our lives. Realistically, there is a moral here that exclaims the unneccssary privation of our excellence. But as I knew, and in some sense as it practically were, that behavior of ours was merely to blind to the future whhich would give room to not be so perfect; and feel fine being only moderatley happy. The progressive point though, is that depsite being so happy, and via our excellent means, that such mode of living required the sort of variety and limberness which any mode would. And our choices had not procurred the support, comfort, relations or care, for what would yield me such. "And our mistake was taking ourselves too serioulsy, and overly relying on our means to make us happy. For in doing so, we turned ourselves away from what would, to the point, be there and heeding to your excellence; and not, as it was known, as a friction or contrast to it. For the choice otherwise, was to be compeltely self sustainable; the price of which was a state of excellence which could only come from day to day action: for neither the truth, nor complacence of others, would accept the end as so. And our cry was such, that we never thought otherwise. But, poorly let it happen."
            <br>&emsp;So as year two came up, we were fairly contemt. Though, our insight at the time was that more invovlement would  produce more ease and regularity in me. And for some part it did. By the spring we were going to church, attending Yoga, showing up for several meet ups online, and life felt good. What I noticed though was that these things were not always desirable to attend; particularly because the nature of them was such, that our truest selve was not known. And rather than going to see friends, it felt like seeing acquaintances or colleugaes. Some new some things about me. But very little of what actually held me through the day I shared. As a result, we stopped going to these things. For the flow of our life was such, that being consistent was key. And it happened that these events felt like things we were waiting for and having to attend. And our actions were such that I just wanted to flow on by. I learned though that these sort of things were accessible to me; and this sense extended to broader means as well. And our future has seemed more pleasing and balanced because of this.
            <br>&emsp;Besides that, we were very productive early in the year, remaking our website, making a bunch of videos online, rewriting our book, and generally maintaining a constant stream of writig; one which has not ceased to this day. Our leisure remained pure, our use of scootering brought much wonder and depth to our days, and the general sentiment around was that we were more than fine, free to be, and on route for a fairer time ahead.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed the summer came. But whereas the prior one felt like a drain, this one held moments which were at worst, moderate. Indeed, our bare appreciation allowed this, but so did scootering get me out of the house; and even out the drawn out days. As my parents came back from trips though, the idea of me leaving was put on hold. They suggested that they would like to travel in the fall, and that I might stay then. I had expressed interest in leaving no later than October 1st. After some time, it was settled that I'd leave December 1st. 
            <br>&emsp;What occured though, is that my parents decided to sell their home in the middle of summer. They had friends who expressed interest in buying the place, and so they made formal agreement. They would sell their home then, and my parents would find a house in Pitt Meadows. The former though never came to par. And still to the day, we have the home we purchased, and the one not yet sold. As it became known, October 26th was the acquisition date. And through the weeks leading up, we loaded up smaller things to be sent down to friends houses. I recall feeling sturdy, yet apprhensive about the whole thing. For it was expressed that, by virtue of senitment, and financial strain, I would have to get a job. I did not care for this, but our choice seemed out of the mattter. Up till this point, we were under the impression that we would recieve means to move once we left our parents. A clear figure of 5000$ was the unsigned agreeement. When I had moved up to Kamloops, I had spent to much money on rent, and accumulated some debt. My parents paid this off for me, kindly; but also gave my sister twice the sum of what they gave me. And the understanding was that I would get the other half when I moved out. This could not occur due to the financial strain of owning two homes. 
            Since we've moved, I have felt a receding amount of contempt regarding our life and scennario. When we did move, there were frequent comments about me getting a job, and indeed I felt compressed between our resitance to doing so, at least in the options available. I leaned in though and attempted to go to Superstore. There was a miscomunnication, and I did not get a job. Till this point, we've spoken to Dev, showed our interest, clarified our ability to work anytime, and hopefully there is some promsie for a new year hire. Similarly, I spoke with Poco and Maple Ridge wal-mart. Each are near equals to Superstore in preference, and, like Superstore, hold oppertunity in the new year. Everything else has been a bust. Despite our initial reservations, we were willing and directed to cleaning, caring, land duties, even conierge. Nothing came through, and all the likely because we sent resumes online. While personal shoppping affords a direct line of contact.
            <br>&emsp;As of now, I feel a bit more part of the family. And despite not seeking a richer end, I still feel a fairer approach to our reasonable destination. Having work would make things at home stable, and thus we'd be happier. But the nature of being at home is that most obligations feel intrusive; especially when it is for the sake of being at home. Compared to our own dependance, being at home feels like an easy comfort. Which, indeed, holds the point of our future remarks: and our parents emphasis on work. At any rate, I am sure we will find some harmony in being here, and more stabily proceed to our final end. It may be otherwise, by virtue of a lack of harmony, or we may recieve that small privalage of being sent there with haste.
            <br>&emsp;Of such end, I see a place I'll be long term. A place whos simple oppertunities can act as promises of relief and improvment. A place who's' very nature directs us to establish our self, and our way. Vancouver seems this land, for it is dense, rough in terrain, yet bold in it's views. And, independance is all I really need; for I feel little long term means or care to direct myself when I'm not.
        </div>
        <div id="frombelow">
            As it often occurs, I need a moment to sift my thoughts and reflect.
            <br>&emsp;Our family is a little unstable, as I. Harmony is always on offer, but the truth in this is hard to oblige, when the present is so rot with the ultimate effects 'of merely having harmony'.
            <br>&emsp;Our stability is such, that we can see, be it alone or with others, the future in a solid and forward way. Currently, however, we see a discociation from our current spot, regardless of harmony. Indeed, the harmony could itself solidify, and secure our drifting pace, 'but still a drift no less'.
            <br>&emsp;Now, in moments of duress, it is hard not to respond to heavily to the current moment. In calmer moments however, but of a negative sort, you can see clearly what is right to do for the years ahead. 
            <br>&emsp;By that, I see that we are not so fit in regards to health, nor is our moral, relational or creative prowess where it could be; nor is our personal interest as collected as I know it could be. "I'd describe our life as a constant amendment for the latter, while the former aspects whilter away; leaving me with nothing by hopes and apprehension, and thereby a drain our interest." 
            <br>&emsp;Our composure within these slower moments lets me see how things ought be, with respect to orientation for the sake of stability. For one, indepandence feels neccessary, for progess is otherwise exposed to the differing forces of others; nor is it able to be consistent, and by that, further. "It often gets dry and swollen, or otherwise cracked in its base, and wilts and wains."
            <br>&emsp;I will not sit here and say that what is near and present, is not either relevant, likely to be irking our emotions and intent. But, in all fairness, the unease I feel is revealing prior notions; or at least current thoughts tailored to our reason and sense. Indeed, I am all to contained, as not to let our negativivity spurr feelings in that 'progressive sense'; as if I considered moving farther forward, away from our current pich, but due to the dissaray which such pitch has brought, and accordingly omtivated, that there are less than proper objects to be measured through our sense, and future regard. 
        </div>
        <div id="soonfinal">
            So we have been asked to stay, once again. Despite this, we have also been offered the means to leave, and in a fair state.
            <br>&emsp;I am not sure what to do. What is right holds me towards Vancouver; as it is where I'd like to be, grow and stay. I compare this to atheletics, in that, for all positions, ought you remain limber and spry. But even if you mean to play baseball, and well, so ought to be in line for that, per the aspects (particular) required. In the same sense, that you may merely be un-negative, and by that, ample in your general atheltics, but thereby not fully foster, that so may you, in your specifics, be equally ample, but not full grown.
            <br>&emsp;In that sense, we have never been unathletic per say. But our time doing so has never been easy, as our amends to cushion and or iron out downward trends, has never been understood or accepted, as such intent was aimed at something non-specific. Across the whole of our lives, ought we be specific, sure. But our cultivation does not lack the product of such pursuit, merely the orientation: as if we indeed had a heading at all. For so long we've merely been, and well, but to no end but that which might call me. It is time, or at least reason ultiamtely suggests, that heeding some call, be it with far or mere limber steps, is upon us.
            <br>&emsp;In this way, we have a fair amount of clarity. As the sentiment within me is one that wavers over the quality of our 'general athletics', but not our direct skill. In other words, we are more concerend, theres a feeling at least, that of our mozying ways, ought we do this or that to make such strides preferable. Indeed, there are remarks about this; and if our strides were not at all ruffled, then surely I'd be fine to remain generally well. But I see from time to time the reality of being so general, and the predicament we find ourself which affords us to do so, in fact not being so stable. By that, in the finer moments of this place, we consider the actual truth of the matter, and where we can be that is not merely general, but actual, stated, right, of ends. 
            <br>&emsp;Indeed, our current moment has me accepting a sort of finality, in that, of our time ahead, so are there things which we see our general attitude being unkept for. I do not doubt that we will reach a point that is appropraite for those; but this carries with it the sentiment 'that we will then begin'. Which, again, is not something I am overt to. But in the current moment, when our ease of mozying is troubled, and were asked to otherwise bolster our generality, or a path which is specific, it is hard not to seek the latter.
