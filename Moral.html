   I can't quite comment on whether being connected with someone would render any dullness outside of this as permimssiable. An initial thought is that as little as you are, from the low pressure around lets say, so would you be comparable in your connection. As it were, a relationship is such that you give something and receive something, and having little of the former does not suggest much in terms of the latter.
   <br>&emsp;Still, my recent insights tell me that with respect to connection, all our troubles and worries surround this; and I only bring up the possible shortcomings of having so (with nothing else) if only to question whether nothing else would be needed is such connection were there. To me, this fairs some truth, for withotu an average connection you must be so much more, or fair the worse of things. 
   <br>&emsp;My point, is that no matter how good you are and all things around, that lacking a connection will procurr some frailty, or restlestness at the thought of being somewhere (contendedly) or not going somewhere where such connection could be found. I can say as of late though, that it is not so much the connection which is an issue but the lack of possibility, or at least a course which is somewhat social and involved, despite lacking a clear connection: you at least look forward to it, nor are you dragged so much by false and far of hopes or positiones, 'whereby your empty heart sees anything other than your isolated place as one of oppertunity'. It is by this that emotions get built and oppertunities that would otherwise reflect your integrated place, get developed as ones which reflect the aims of one without integration. So in that our past solitude is rearing up its adjacent longings. Though, we in that stage of life procurred ourself as to overcome this, but in effect flattered ourselves to much and elsehwere fell to the fancies and illusions of reservation and idle haste. As we have become more ingrained into a recreational and communal sort, we are seeing more oppertunity ahead, all whilst feeling better and clearer in our solid selves, along with sinking into confidences and approaches that reflect such a self moving forward (or into) realms and regions which were once forbidden -as we were either to afraid or quick to condemn such actions. 
   <br>&emsp;The future then is quite hopefull and exciting, but of a natural and sprouting sort. We do have those old emotions and expectations coming up, which in themselves wrangle our new found confidences, as they appear as means to procurr such desires. But as those interests fade and new ones, or possible ones at least come in, so will our otherwise advances settle into their own practical lanes, whereby we can both boldly and unaversibly proceed. To those I would like to mention
   <br>&emsp;First, and in general, is our fragments, which to begin held Batttlefield 5 as its starting roster, and has since then transitioned into Battlefield 1. In its case there is a retread back into the basics of publishing, but so are our hopes mild, nor are our future intentions of bringing writing into the platform haltered by any amount (or not) of success regarding these prior bf clips. As it were, those battelfield clips have shown that there is a brisk interest, which itself shows no signs of reaching a monetary sort, nor is oppertuinty much closer -especially considering the actual merrit of achieving so is through writing- so I can say, for the moment and the period to come, that whether I care or not is the real question; and so far, as our channel has come, I feel nearly full in our meaning of the clips, which the fragments themselves will show. In that, for a briefer word, I am committed and ready to make it because that is what I want to do: and the lack of money in the years ahead nor oppertunity much sooner, is no hurdle for the otherwise couple hundred views each video gets. By this count, an increase in that reception only makes me care more, and finding oppertunitites or income only come from the constancy that is motivated through that. So in that sense, we are on track, but happy where we stand. And to be exact, the actual elements of those coming fragments are themselves nearly set, and only in need of a refinement in the assembly: but each part is itself done.
   <br>&emsp;Besides that we are working to create the third version of our book. This one is meant to be somewhat final, as I intend to submitt it to publishers. That in its own right has become a relieving success, as simply familiarizing ourselves with the requirments and letting our response naturally cultivate, makes the path towards that a pleasing one. Still, the book has added a new section, while removing unneccessary parts to the prior ones. As well, we've arranged the pieces much better, leaving one's to do with philsophy and what not as the first part (of rounding out lets say) then put the personal, considerate pieces in the latter half. "think ostentation for New Light and For Goondess in rounding out." There are many to be fair which are on the chopping block, and many (if not more) require a second look for the purpose of tightening. My aim is to finish by the end of January and at  least have  a version for myself, and althoug theres no short amount of time (and thus pressure) to finish by that date, when we do we can send it to our family and friends, which is nice. If we are accepted for publishing then we will do a closer pass on every entry, as I am sure theres a spelling mistake, or room for improvement at any rate for each of them. But for now, we can create our own piece, then take the gems and offer those as samples for agents or publishers. On top of this though is pure essay submission, which seems rather direct and prolific in its possibility. I am less tuned in to what that requires, but I am sure when we write our querry letters we can approach the piece-submissions similarly.
   <br>&emsp;On our own private end, I mean to write our autobiogrpahy. At least, in a comparable way to our trackings of cosmology and geology, so do we need some firmness in our childhood and youth, and adolescence as it would seem. There is much reflection from this, alongside further questions which will serve the refinement that our subsequent book needs. To mention that, A Mason's Tale is a reflection of our live and time and a deliberation as to how it can better change. This is a tuning period of our time, with not much but inquiries coming from this. What I seek is a complete step, which is to say anwsers and conclusions from that calibrated self. In that domain sits the corpral nature of violence, war and gratuity, the limits of physical vocabulalray, the weakness of intervention (and its according assumptions), and the otherwise free and liberal stream of nature and her gifts- whereby leisure, industry, care and rest are assessed. I mean to mention this in the forward of our book, along with the 'attempt' like nature of each piece and how the heart of it is to be (if so) commended, and that poor writing may be a consequence of this pure inquiry/attempt. 
   <br>&emsp;In any case, our own formative writings are of these kinds, where we begin to address what it is we actually think and can conclude: and chartering ourselves will secure the loosers prefaces to our mind. On a casual scale, ie. the wonder of clouds, we have come through cosmology, geology and paleontology, ancients, middle ages and somewhat into the times of industry, whereby there are modern elemtns which are somewhat desirable, though the contents of the world are actually what strike me now, as in the bios of the greats, the fields of study -namely the church- and that of trade and technolgoy -those virtues of engineering and agriculture, along with the workings of a camera. Perhaps sums will follow.
   <br>&emsp;I can tell that our plan is not hedged on us being alone, and then counting on the natural outgrowth of the corresponding fruits. Instead, we are sweeteneed enough, and happy to boldy yet plainly proceed, whereby that outgrowth is more firmly advanced and made. Admittedly, we do have our own privations -ie. the fragmments- but these are themselves a personal priority, as I really do care; and considering their sole demand of constancy and according promsie from doing so, I can still say with honesty that such a course (and efforts) reflects those private outgrowths, but of a bolder kind. Whereas before we thought taht either A) we would simply outgrow from simply being me, or B) that by making a website or something basic like that, that some wiff of this would cross someone by and spark their interest: and oh how great we are that they'd then see, and the worlds interest was in store. I know little of what we could recieve, but I am safe in saying theres not much I could wish for; at least when it comes to the fortunes of free living and travel that these are but further garnishes to our liberal self, and that connection is not only present in the most illfortuned of ways, but garnered no more from those which are in fact fortuned. "For all it takes is openesss and communication, which no scenario procurres or bolsters. Its a means to hiding and remaining in control if you feel otherwise." I will say in the Fragment's case, that we have set up a fair routine for wide creation, and that for the most part the work in question is both of a desirable and fruitfull sort, at least for me (as we are invovled and received enough to care). In that, the point in which constancy will need a refill is far away enough that I am fretting not whether we will do it at all, and if so how we will do it that much; for in a month I am sure we could at least do a 100, which gives me much time to write and publish till then, and otherwise in between. Mom and Dad are planning on moving, as are we happy to then be in the city, where there are more churches, drop in activites and events, along with other things of an involved sort. Dating is expensive, but the value is there once were settled; and all this in combination with our scooter (and resourcefull use of transit) makes the world wider and purer than ever before. In that, I am excited, comforted, and secure enough to try advanced things. Whihc, to be clear, offer little more than you could get alone, in terms of the dearest things at least; but still, as money would offer no more, so would you want some for the goods it brings, which such advances can be targeted for, or aimed at rather. "Don't confuse it is what I mean, as you are indeed on track, or working towards more worldy and exciting things, but so is this ununque when it comes to finding love, creativity or friendship. And, in fact, those things being addressed are what will bring you down that professional line, so that there is more food on the plate amdist your love otherwise. Just don't forget where each came from, and how you can be right now."
</div>
<div id="endofanera">
   I was so brazen in our hopes, but perhaps rightfully so. We are indeed amongst the class of those who would be rightly considered remarkable. "And although my estimate may be off, I can at least humble myself in saying that, amidst that class, we are of the lowest." I am effectively permitting my decree of caliber by reserving its nature, 'as if I were simply saying that I was amongst the best, only behind them'; in this though there is much flattery, 'for oh how little am I comapred to those greatest, in being so slightly behind'. 
   <br>&emsp;I do try at any rate, and, be it well or fully placed, I still hold myself accountable. In all these sentiments there is a bit of innacruacy, and deceipt at that. But I have gone through the shcool of knocks, at least there have been several moments where our honest self was shown to be poor. Addressing that and making amends is whats brought me to where I am. "whereby I stand taller, but from farther back, in the sense that my heart and soul have been mended and set, as to provide a deeper platform to rise from."
   <br>&emsp;So although it seems like the end of an era, and stage at that, I still see more of the same ahead. Only, as we have experienced before, that the coming steps will be stronger than those prior, particularly when it comes to those macro adjustments that our weakness' held us to do. People are returning to our life, as are we to people. Our importance, despite receding, held us in terms of quality and approval, yet we were idle in our activity, or hasty otherwise in bringing it to life; in that, we were both afraid or unconcerned with being more forward, heeding what we were drawn to try at least. Now we are making a firm advance; not with any rush in mind or fear from our past mistakes, but one which is merely forward and unhindered by procrastination or discomfort. "As it were, we've surrendered ourselves to what we need, and in that we are unafraid (nor heavily staked)" to boldy be, and proceed. This came about in our fragments, but so is that resting (perhaps the easiest) on the simple act of doing what I seek, and at any rate relishing (and continuing from such return) the meager sufficiency required. "Or the short means to satisfaction at that, which our writing, essays, dating, community and what not (ie. future jobs and efforts) are sprouting to comply. Which gives much tender yet firm clarity and footing in our advance ahead." Such a smooth and ready course is most pleasing.
</div>
<div id="aboutourdays">
   As we have come about our days, much has been fostered, quite little which has been lost, and admittedly a great deal which has been passed over unneccessarily. In effect were in a predicament, though a fair amount of reflection and habit will surely mend it out.
   <br>&emsp;'What can we learn about the way things are', is what I find myself saying. We knew that our worldy ambitions were based on what we thought was possible, and more prominently weighted by our relation between where other people were and where I thus sought to be. I also know that from this goals, we were so reserved in our daily action, as the method by which we'd approach was one that was both unlimited in terms of how much we could put in, and accordingly in need of a relative amount of skill and strenght from us personally. Now, as regards friends, purpose and pleasure, I will say more later. As for our practical living and ease of movement, I can say the purest thing which is the calming and securing place of regular iternaries. Here, you are amongst people, and even the mere conversation regarding your name and intent is soothing; both, in that it gives your place more clarity and peace, along with evening out the road to come, as there is somewhere to return to; which itself, primarily, softens the reigns a little, as you have less need to push forth out of idle fears seeing as some committment is coming. On top of that, these activities are quite light in comaprions, and that social aspect adds a warming flare, that in combination allows our more rigorous creative time to settle and incorporate. This has been nice and dandy, especially considering the brief time its been done.
   <br>&emsp;Our core mistake rises though, as in being so initial in our outward strides, so have the more significant aspects of this not taken hold. In regards to friendship and attraction, the road has been not much more than level. In fact, as we left highschool the path seized, and less we were in college or working, the exposure to other people was sparse. And at that, our communicatio was quite poor, as our early cynicism and later constance held me from either offering my interest or time to other people, and being pro-active and outgoing at any rate -which is more in line with what were doing right now. And that being said, our current situation is not one that affords much space to be more open and forward, but merely try in our attempts to put ourselves out there. Also in these regards is our further sight on writing and our recent forray into the content world. These at least are offering more forward steps towards the broader side of the world, and in effect is quite uplifting, as we have no reservations to try, and are otherwise leaning inwards enough to proceed. "Such inhesitance offers a the according result, of feeling on track; nor is our boldness and content in doing so an unimportant point, for we fear not to lose or have much haste to gain, but a mere step towards the whole of things; and in that we bring our true self."
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, we are not in much company, at least enough for others to commonly pass us by. We are electing to go out there, which itself takes off the edge along with breathing in some consistency, but for the most part these involvements are only of that sort, and as such offer but faint chances to make a friend. At the very least, there has not been someone who seems to draw my sight, for the majority of folk in question are much older. I do mean to go to yoga, but still, even if there were a bevy of attractive women, converse would still be hard. Time does offer much to those who keep to her sides; which allows both more to be gained from the simplest of things, and otherwise offers the chance for things to change and grow. Trying then rewards us with such, for the possibility is at least there; though the further bounds of deeper connection feel faint.
   <br>&emsp;Neverthless, I do see much hope on this horizon; for I cannot pretend like we aren't free anb satisfied in being more full and founded with ourselves. "The years have always lacked such ease." And at any rate, the more we try in those common affairs, so are we more liable to consider other things, which at the very least broadens the pool of possibility. Nor are there a lack of things which offer more direct attempts, such as online dating or training. These have their own molds to fit, but as a screw we are becoming more sizeable and malleabe where we seek to take hold.
</div>
<div id="ourguard">
   So I can say that we are refined in our desires, however unmet. As with most things of this sort, it is not so much the lacking but our guard and reservation from seeking, which has me feeling closed off. At any rate, the actual shortcomings of being without, can be procurred on both the ends of fortitude, along with the appreciation and use of whats already here. This is all fine and pleasing, for we are not absent from much, merely moving as ourselves, with our family, active and communally invovled... but wheretoo then? As we have so much, and are otherwise on route, and at least fortified against whats not, there is no burning flame behind us, pushing is out of what would otherwise by an ioslated discontent, whereby we'd stake our forward efforts on acquiring us the means of attraction and renound: if only to connect. Without this here, there is much room and reason to reassess and furnish your aims. For I do not wish to be idle, or reckless despite our supportive warmth. As it were, we still lack much of what makes the world beyond us exciting; and that isn't so much about what we cannot see, or where we cannot go, but who we are with and in what fashion. Although there is possibility and our proceeding steps seems more sound and well placed, so are at most involved in common activities and the according people. Theres few our age, nor is there much constance of conversation and relations for something past the point of peerdom to be gained. This is fine indeed and in effect removes the edge and gratuity of being myself, but so are we only that. Perhaps in a way, we only ever will be, even if that means we are in the bounds of another, or off on some adventure. We will still be me; and in efffect, those meaningfull or intimate efforts seem both fair and desired on their prescence and place amongst that person which is I. In that sense, we are happy to proceed, for in our lack we are still with ourselves, honestly, and of those things which draw us, despite their abscnece, we are sincere in our hopes of them.
   <br>&emsp;I think, in short, that we are best to address the things you actually wish to do, and furnish them with an integrity to the things themselves. In that, we need no fear or contrivance about what we will get, or will lack. We know that of those things which bring love and warmth to our life is only acquired through communication, and otherwise amends. The fruits of fortune and the trades are but a scenario in which we can be; yet, at least as I can reflect, the shortcomings and accompanying reservations for that are in the known lackings of such love and warmth, despite our freedom for liberty and fecundity. Those are fine, and having such favor as to be able to do that, makes we feel swell. But not even the kingdom of England would ever gain much peace in my heart, less I had a friend, or at least was one to myself; which, in effect, since we are naturally and normally drawn to the comforts and company of men, means that if we are not held back from approaching so, or being near and around at least, then we will not be happy. That is the lesson, and the current effects are such that our prior ways did not proucurr what our current actions are aimed at. But we are reassessing now; and in seeing that our ways are most importantly unreserved, then we can whitehr off this need to expect, yet through contrivance succeed. Lets just be, curiously and for the sake of invovlement, all while letting who you really are come and shine to be. I know not where, but I can confidently say that I am not afraid to succeed. We just want to be ourself, for in that there is not much limit other than me: which over time, fell to the reserved nature that occurred due to our dishonesty. In that, we were not or nor have we been sad or defeated because we lacked fame and friends, but because we retreated from desiring so, or at least told ourselves against. These things are not neccessary, but in our reproach from what was otherwise not contemptable, we both furled ourselves down some ill-sighted road, and held our breath at what was desirable. In other words, it was not our lack but our reservation; for in being more open the world feels less misguided or seperate, but rather integrated, yet of members who are not their for me, nor I them. My heart being open means that I can freely go my way; which by my brain and bones fetters not over these abscences, but is quite happy to feel like the possibility could exist; or at any rate, if someone were to pass by, we'd be open. Which is the point: not that one had or will, but that if it did we were not closed off.
   <br>&emsp;So, for instance, I want to describe nothing, argue against intervention, confirm the nature of dark energy, acquire the time and place of the greats, dance through yoga to Oceania, discuss the gifts of Joker, Moria, Golden Gate, Rex Paddock, the Veil of tears -towards the door, glance from the side. The integrity of depth, "Mark that man (who is a women), or, hey guys (to a group of girls)," the purpose of government -and my obediance. In other words, warrant my interests because I tried, and am at liberty to be drawn, but not so because we are free, but because I stand truly enough that attempt, as not to fear that our means will not further for some other end, nor the confusion that their needed for this, but the honest reproach, to seek such things and embrace their sincere place as your interest, which the approach draws out meaing's, task's, reason's and purpose's warrant -as being so.
</div>
<div id="plainbeat">
   I'm just tired, plain beat. Not for long admittedly, but right now our strides are feeling heavy. What I am noticing, is that in this state the world feels small; for there is nothing so defined, and fairly so, that extends past ourselves, or whats common at any rate. Thus we feel closed in. 
   <br>&emsp;In effect, our deed is to rest; for it is alright that not much is ahead, for like air that lifts up a tent, so is our stream absent, whereby that canopy of life seems small. This is ok, we must merely rest. Doing so though is boring, and our choices offer no real excitement. As it were, in those times of old, we procurred little of this for it seemed like the domain of our selection included the use of substance (and poor ones at that). We could simply use these things ourselves, and be quite content. Though the lesson as of late is that such domain of outerward interests is not so selective, to gluttony that is, but holds activities and events which are more warming and communal. Still, these never crossed my mind, for my aim was not so much of rehabilitation, but something equally exciting as our sprung up state would otherwise enjoy: I did not see the value of restoration or rest. In those more common things (and fresher too), their activity was of a lighter sort, so you would be moving but with less concentration; and otherwise, the structure that they'd bring would allow us to easily to sit and relax, as something was seen coming. "As it occurred though, our lack of itinerary had me moving ahead, for doing nothing with little that was further (ahead) defined, made me feel isolated and terrible."
   <br>&emsp;It would seem, and I am going back to the junkfood era of our childhood and the scandalous nature of our youth, whereby the course of our life has been more or less determined by whether we were bored. For, good things come to those who prepar, and are otherwise consistent; but repitation requires breaks, or at least genuine lows of the interval; and when that was so, we were not able to rest, recuperate than go at it again. Our principle held us over time, but not to a growing state, as everytime we built up and rest was needed, we indulged and levelled out where we were before. Learning from this has made our subsequent attempts greater, and generally over the recent years our constancy has been more ingrained, but so are we moving, yearning to leave our rest, and still not making much progress. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, our frivolous desires bear on our resting state with a the pressures of inferiority and discontent. Even if we are fine to be still, such feelings prick at me to move hastly. "At least that is our response to these feelings, and their cause coming from our stillness." Now, passing this as a model, whereby we'd address what rest is for, in our aims at least, I can otherwise say that when you are in fact moving, the world's canopy elevates, and farther things can be seen. In that, with a clear mind, you can see various things to do; which contrasts the restless nearsightedness that can otherwise occur. That is, when wish to move but have little to give, and the world is small, you feel poor at the lack of things to be seen. Moving properly brings this to life; and as our consitency has allowed for our steps to produce more grounds, or familiarity at least, to those farther things, so does their memory stay. And, at any rate, as we grow under these fairer developments, we can see more; as if, upon the return to our readied state, we have a full tank of sight and optimism, whereby the elements which we saw before are given more interest and life, as to at least further our excitement and solidity to the road ahead. In a way then, it is our restless nature which has us burning out the nearby edges, and keeping our time ill prepped for those wholesome strides, and is otherwise grinding at best towards that secondary layer. "But not to the world around."

<div id="walksofmen">
   Happily, we are reading David Hume, who has much forward yet plain speech, similar to mine and Plutarchs; though the subjects he covers are, lets say, more modern; and even his assay into human affairs, holds similarly contemporary points of view (when compared to Plutarch). For instance, he distinguihses the passions from taste, saying that the former holds more elation at both the good and bad extremes, while the latter holds more stock in great people, study and the arts: and his suggestion, more or less, and which I am in agreement of, that being more moderate in those former passions will provide a pleasing and amiable living in the common elements of our time, while those liberal tastes can be otherwise selected, which he suggests we do so for the sweets of that, rather than being overly passionate. He speaks about government a great deal, which admittedly falls over me as I am less clear on the terms; though, in being so plain and stately, I see a brief road to connect our own ideas, and develop them at any rate, which seems to let off the edge within our civil affairs -as we have held little knowledge here to date. One instance of merrit I saw, was his regards for the point of governments; and that in discussing this, the property of obediance came up; here he makes the simple remark that authority and liberty must convene and co-operate, with those giving up the  latter doing so through obediance, while those holding the servicable position of the former, must listen and amend, as their post is one guided by the protectice and servicable nature of the law. In my mind, our governments, of Canada that is but generally those modern, are not ones which we have any need to overthrow or worry about; theres but a mere slant towards various points of view in parliment: yet the system remains. The particular offices which bear such slant, and those who act as speakers and educators are fair in their offerings, but less I do this well, then my place already is to heed what the government says, if only to receive the liberty which its authority provides. Unless that authority reigns itself in, and unneccessarily so, then I will obey: otherwise, I will then be concerned and take action.
   <br>&emsp;Lastly, on the initial front, is the Gallic war. This was a over thought from some time back, and only in the recent holiday months did I see the chance to grab it. In fact, amongst the books I purcahsed, it was the last. I am pleased then to share the mighty time I've had reading it. Foremost is the clear way that its presented, and the fair nature in which its material reflects. So much of my life I have been toiling against this impression (and normality) of the brutality, rape, tortue and cruelty, that reading the plain words of Caeser have given me ample regard and cheer. The simple reason, is that within an event -such as thee Gallic war- there are a bevy of steps and alltercations, each with their own beginnings, exchanges and ends. One such example is the punishment issued by Caeser to one of the tribes who had rashly attacked them following a peace-treaty; his account is that the senators were executed, and the people sold into slavery. How nice is that, that such a sentence is, in all its severity, holds not much darkness. There is a remark about a Germanic king who had, as stated, tortued children given over (as hostages) from a surrendered tribe; but even then, I suspect they were branded, as the act was supposedly done so as a mitigating threat. At any rate, I can summize the general appeal of this by drawing the integrity of depth, whereby I reserve myself from being opionated of situations in which I am ignornat, yet, I hold the accounts of what should be know with such integrity of depth that I am willing to be so reticent across the world as a whole. Seeing the ordinary interactions of the Romans and the Gauls, and how even the term 'Gaul' holds no definitive weight, gives me the impression that in China, India, Russia, all of Europe, the modern states and countries, that we are so likely to be wrong in our views due to the fact that we are almost surely ignorant of the many parties and their interactions, that being reticent seems appropriate. At least, in reading about the Gallic war, I feel like I have an account which respectfully defines the world, whereby I see how little else anything is probally known, for no thing -across the walk of our lives, but in which we have so many opinions of- obviously holds any similar sort of reference, by which our opinions are made. Recently, I had a similar experience reading Rousseau's memoir, whereby the comparable world of industrial France came to light, and all those murky (and sometimes cruel) images of past times was shed. This is quite comparable to the subject of war, which, in short, held nothing but our imagination filling in small holes, which themselves could not find much else to think of than the excruiting detail of killing a man with a sword; yet we are so wrong to worry about or consider so, for we have entirely no sense or mind for where such action occurs. And, as I stand, both are those details migthily overlooked, and due to a lack of context or placement. That is its own discussion; but I can say, that being empty headed, but letting stories, fables, accounts and graphic imagery fill it, is more akin to drops of dye inpurifying an other wase clear vase of water, rather than an earthy mold which serves as a solid and encompassing mold for particulars to be sketched in. "As it were, lacking the latter while having the former, is much better than being inundated with the latter, but of a hollow mold."

<div id="tochurchandback">
   For the present then, I can only say that it invovles, well, much invovlement. So far, we've been to the United Churhc, which was pleasant, the Buddhist Church, which was good and fair, twice the Shambala, which, albeit challenging, held much profit and warmth (in its company), and all of this with two coffee chats in between -whereby we learned, and evened out our view of online work (and its means), and travel, and its niceties, but frequency too. That is our day, and, soon, we will be doing Yoga sessions (Hatha, intermediate), and some sort of spiritual group gathering. Thats quite a bit I'd say! Although there is more on these horizons, I will mention I present creative pursuits -as to be more present. One, is that the shorts are prepped and readying along. Besides the titles, and filling out the rest of April, we are scheduled till the start of May, whereby we will take the assembly we've created, produce, and employ Epictetus's writings. This path is one which will take time to come to fruition; but the work is quite significant to me, particualry in how it represents, and is otherwise quite fulfilling and clarifying from the work we do. On top of that, we are bringing our sights onto publishing, whereby we send out letters, and otherwise scan and find both common and modern outlets to inquire of. In effect, our aim is tigthen our book, going over each piece and giving them a firm pass, then arranging them to be more readable and flowing. The intent, or at least broader aim, holds the book in these forward regards; but as our time loosens from such editing, and our energy can transfer to submission, we can also consider the inidivudal essays themseles; which seem to offer more chances of selection, and more particular outlets to do so. 
   <br>&emsp;Now, regarding our studies, which admittedly have less reason then our life can attest, is still important to me. In short, we mean to go over things which feel alarmingly stricken by me; be it the clouds, the general idea of governance, the churhc, or the mere workings of a camera (and light for that matter). I would remark on what we need, though our course is not so clear. Foremost, is that we are a word, tired, and such reflects our adult life, and all its pride and shortcomings. Better yet, our admission to this does not retract the effects which our mistakes afforded. And so, despite our mind being somewhat on track, and our steps moving with a fairer pace, whereto we do not know, for we are still weary from those harsher strides prior, and of those literally of late. In that, I will refer to what is passing ahead, and leave a firm remark as to our ends for later. Simply, I have been vetting various activites; the aim, admittedly, is to make a friend or find a partner, but time is required for that, nor are the bulk of such activities privy to that. "In their like of people my age, or like me at any rate, and the required time to be acqaintanced at that." Still, we are personally benefited from this tasks, as their light activty and regularity gives us both something restorative to do, and otherwise shoulders our proper ability to let off our own reigns, and relax. The Church, Yoga, the particular zoom call we've done and meditation session at that, offer this in nice amounts. But I see more of these things we can try. For instance, joinging an elective program, of say cooking or photography, can allow for some skills, enjoyable activity, relative peers and the according bonds made through regular excitment. These may be timely, too expensive, short, and otherwise unavailable; but with some research, I am sure we can find something at local colleges, city centers, or anything at that. On that note, Yoga is something quite pleasant, integral and usefull; so much so that the price of it seems of value, particulallry if your attneding to your life as opposed to your future position. In that, we can research different offerings, and find the one suited for me. We may even find something similar to the program were in; which admittedly is once per week, but of a fair price. Otherwise, the YMCA, cheap drop ins at studios, and otherwise well-evalualted prices, can afford good selection. Regarding churhc and temple, these are more common in the metro area, but present everywhere to some extent. More than that, on one end, is strict meditation or spiritual gatherings, which offer a yougner audience (I'd say), and more approachable grounds for both enjoyment and converse; on the other end, sits different kinds of group, akin to church, but of a secular and or humanist sort. This too requires research, but through meetups or organizatoins, we may find somewhere to go. That, in a word, is the crux of our interest, which refers nicely to what I mentioned above, wherein we tned to our live, not our future position. In that, we can move without fear, for we are ourselves and unmitigatinlg so; as such, we need no reservation for some other end, nor the discomfort of not getting what we seek: we need only show up. Be it to writers events, submission contests or offers, mixers and other public things of the sort, we can try, explore, get invovled. Money may limit us out of regular attendance to things -such as the symphany- or our interests may not align; but research, openess and acquiesing, provides, so try.
   <br>&emsp;To close, I'll note some things which we mean to incorporate. An old one, but of interest via its utility, is the increase of our voice, both in its projection and annunciation. "So Soliluquiy is easier to say, proudly." Air purifiers, and voice lamps, seem to improve our room; and in terms of value, their favor may be less so in the warmer and lighter months, yet we still have three months nearly of cold; so theres some starting worth at that. Perhaps this is in line with our studies, but moreso of a task, is our history; this is in need of accounts for our homes, schooling, people, jobs, fitness and mind. Details, mistakes, vision and thoughts ahead, can be remarked on: but this reference needs the floor itself. Which, as were talking about facts, can be just done, or noted at least, and drawn out through prose. Our studies are moreso for light, devices, government, the greats, and the civil measures of the world, along with the Big Bang, spectroscapy, the accerlation evidence and the flat universer. "As it a concrete starter, for doubting at least -as we know precisely where I knowledge goes."

   So I am not sure what a demoacry is, in the purest sense; but I do know that, by public voting, that is democratic. In strict contrast is an absolute government, usually monarchal. Here, the rule is led by a supreme leader, along with his delegates; and, generally, this reign is passed on through family lines; and otherwise, power is gained by favor and prestige. A populous government on the other hand is one of a parlimentary sort, in that the rule is done by laws, enacted by choosen representatives to bring out those laws. There is a minister, or even a king, but if the system holds everyone in bound, then it is not wealth, prestige, blood or avarice that determines much, as the laws and input of others hold one back from producing so.
   <br>&emsp;In that, the questiono of liberty arrive, in that one has more rights and freedoms if that is so, while the authorative lens withdraws that. Clearly, there is a balance, evidently at least. For government is an agreement, for those who revolt and throw it down may in fact install a state of anarchy. At any rate, the development and dispersal of public goods will not be, well, governed. This is worth understanding as a pure alternative, but as it were, most upheavels usually end with a new sect of leadership being installed. It seems since the dawn of time, when efforts and needs were to be regarded and managed, that rule was required. And considering the domain of justice, conqeust, policing, commerce, the pulpit and other base services is so wide and usefull for civilized state of the world, so ought an according form, of fidelity, mark the force which governs it.
   <br>&emsp;In that, we may suspend our wishes to have full liberty, and that of commodity too; for the latter, as said, only comes through management. And, as a group of people all running by their own whims amounts to very little in a military sense, so do those, well arranged and ordered amount to more. For at least in this case an aim can be ardently pursued. This may be wrong then in that what we seek is not in need of such governance; but considering that those needs are in fact so, let us at least subject ourselves to any requirments for this if that is so. We can, for instance, be thankfull for our own personal strenght, along with our wit, but in terms of electricity, waste disposal, roads and the general laws (shouldered by enforcement) which allow us to practice religion, and walk the streets without fear of unbriddled crime, these are not so willfully acquired, but in a word, given. 
   <br>&emsp;As fair as this point is, we can rest a little on this authorative notion, that it is merrited so much as it provides what we seek, and does so in the ways which such desires are in need of. In regards to liberty though, we generally have all of it. There is, to be fair, a slew of things we cannot do, but here the mightiest point stands. Simply, if you wish to perform an act of thievy, battery, purgery or fraud, then a unit will dispatched from a goverened institution, and less you resist, you'll simply be arressted. As evidence from you being there and any other element which can be gathered, will be submitted to a body of judges, who, using not but the facts at hand, will determine what occured, then weigh that against the consequences that such acts are deemed within the law. The concenr of capital punishment arises as an instance where that sentence is up for question, but as a course of concluding lacivious affairs, so is that unviersal. What If I asked you though, 'would you walk over there for me, pick up my papers, then return them?' To which I may reply, 'sorry, but I cannot'. Consider, whether the former has any leverage against the latter, in that they could claim they were being infringed upon by the law. If the latter attacked the other person, then of course that would be the case. But, in this regard, if it is just a plea to do something, there is not common rule that says you must oblige. And I ask you, what rules there are that govern you to do anything? Failing to hold the door, saying thanks, being welcoming and polite in your gestures does, more or less, determine whether you'll make any friends, and may in effect lower your advantages towards benefit; but is any law saying that such must be obliged? 
   <br>&emsp;The authority of the law then seems most pressing, and relevant, when we consider what limits are placed on us in what we want to do. Better yet, seeing is there is not much which we (in a way) must do in order to get what we need, then the question of liberty is given. For we cannot pursue commerce, labor or trade withut paying taxes. Nor can we be a miserable prick and expect any pleasure, rewards or employment. Nor, if we had all the coin in the world, could we own anything without municipal submission. At this point though, we are in need of a firmer sight of the need for government to begin with. We may, at any rate, wish to go back to a time where all we needed was done so through our willfull gathering, where no authority was needed. But so much as anything is, and considering the complexity where thats arrived, so is an accordingly secure government required. I am not, for the moment, suggesting what it is we exactly need; but I am for the moment presuming the need for courts, commerce, police to name a few. And that given those, we only need be concerned with the sufficient managent of that. Be it monarachal, communistic or democratic, that is for men, essayists, schemere and pundants to decide. But, of their hopes, or fairs ends at least, it is the provision and maintence of goods and services that society needs; or in other words, the worth of authority, and how such a reign should be with respect to the worth its governance is based on. 
   <br>&emsp;For I do not know why taxes are required; nor do I have much insight as to whether policing is effective. But the question, as all problems bring this, is about our liberty. Again, it is a given that certain things which we seek, and are fine to accept as favorable, requires some authority. But why does property operate the way it does within such governance; why are their common laws in general, as in the ability to drive while intoxicated, or the control of substance use or commerce. I do not know. And, to reiterate, despite being asked little by the law, and considering there is not much dispute that crime and theft cannot be done withotu punishment, we still have the a canopy of civil legislature above us. In that sense, there are borders which we cannot freely cross, nor can we access certain services without basic obligement; nor can our children be ours with pure soverignty. These come to mind, but the point is that, considering our wants and need that regard our liberty, so are there limits on that. We may alter our previous point by saying that public services and preferences are in fact besides our liberty, and as such merrit some submission to authority -as they govern the provision of it. But all other things which refer to things we are otherwise able to do, understandibly at least, have their own questionable limits, or authority; whereby the way we spend our coin, hold a family, drive a car, are not liberties which we purely have. Again, the functioning of the world beyond the provision of grain is something we have to consider; for in that, the need for government is shown; yet the steps of our lives are also mitigated, or subject to rules and policy. 
   <br>&emsp;The point then is comparable to the base argument of orderly or not nature, whereby everything past that is a subject of one or the other; yet, of those subjects, in reference to their base stand, can be regarded by the pratcial and common norms of such topic. In that, our base concern is whether governance is needed at all. And as nothing in the world appears to be unorderly, or of any favor if so, so do we see the need for governance if agriculture, policing and courts are of interest. The shades and hues of taxes though or other domestic affairs are more unique and questionable. We can, to be clear, address what is best when it comes to those fundemental affairs; yet, in these minor ones, the affairs themselves can be addressed -and the according resolve. Perhaps, in short, we can argue over the ways that the institution for security, goods and justice are upheld, but not so much as we agree with governence will we question whether such groups are warranted. In regards to the bureuas for child services, transporation, commerce (of a non-base sort), and that of intelligence, education, censorship etc., these, although admittedly our ignornace has no point past the acceptance of these at some base level, can still afford scrutiny and suggestion to the nature of their existence; for they, in some sense, seem to be products of the general prescence of government, as if offspring to something we deem essential. In other words, how Zeus, Hades and Poseidon operate is up for debate, but their stature is there so much as Gods are needed. But as for Ares, Artemis or any of the demigod offshoots, these are but extensions of those, and thus subject to baser inquiries and doubts.

<div id="falseends">
   I believe my writing would be enough, as would our view of the sun and moon, where and when I am. My family is getting old, and being near that is both warming and important. Nor is there a lack of things which typically come where there are people. 
   <br>&emsp;We built our efforts so high on a pedastool, that bringing them forward never felt suitable, nor fitting. "What, will we have to go through this arduous process, only for them not to get it! No, our words are great, and be it my life it takes, we will go about it so that they are fully said and grown." I don't know why this is neccessary. I suspect theres this fleeing seperation, the crux of it all I think, where you feel like the world is ending, and you've let them down. You might even pretend like your dying, as to catch their notice.
   <br>&emsp;I think the better course is one where you take your preferred step, and do so without much baggage or prestige, whereby you take them firmly and through, because that groove is what you want, to be, fully: and it need not be a purer means to  false ends. Find out where you could go, to be, and if offering ceratin advice, or remedying your ruffled view is what you seek, then go for it. But your broader regard needs a sincere assessment. For, if the world is foolish, so is our demise natural. And if it doesn't have to be, then at least know what would be good. Your posterity doesn't matter, nor man's reign; your not giving up. And yes, they are all moving on, because your stopped, afraid, trying to bring yourself forth in a way that leaves you unexposed; yet, in that, you also see suffering, or a solution at least; and less you solve that, you don't earn your chance, your destiny and fame.
   <br>&emsp;I guess our reproached state holds certain truths; as if the world is not so full of problems, but rather we are poor. Yet, there are issues, or things to maintain and cultivate at least; and at any rate, there is alot being said, or at least alot which you could here. This takes away your levelled view, and asks you to be present; but you know not what that is. In fact, your view is one, of grandiose, destiny and recognition, whereby you foster the truth, and let it glow; yet, where and when, and how, will that happen? Is it not going to be the same initial step? I think overall your reservation is one of learned fear, in that what was right could not be where others were; yet you have not been then; which leaves you feeling either responsible or abandoned by the world. Removing this from being the case, in that you assimilate, and let the natural course of problems flow, you then would be stuck in your ordinary ways. You may be bold, and otherwise find something important such as mere volunteering, but it is of you, from you, be it good, local, or perhaps misfortuned. There lies our doubt, our fear, in that upon letting go of these reservations, we will be withotu the purpose we sacrificed everything for, and thus lacking the latter too. We have our interest though, the driving factor by which our restrictions and fear caved around. Theres a genuine draw, curisoity and good when it comes to nothing, rest, violence and expression. There is, and that can be the mark which drives you where you go. I do know however that your time as one has led to an all encompassing response, both in that oracle responsability, and according response of fleeing to doom; but you can tell the truth, as can you martial your knowledge and sense like they were those things that your youth already implores. Honesty is just like accounting, and the resolve is easy. But curiosity combined with our immature edge, leads me to an overall meaning, and as such the infedility of our arguments and position. There seems to be problems, or at least what I seek is not bound well enough in what would be in fact local too me. "As if the universe were the subject of my painting hand." This is fine, and like building a home, attending sessions for school, or the mere act of doing chores, definition and regard can be given to these broader things, no matter the souce. Beacause again, there is nothing so primarily poor here, only a dishonest address, as our time has in one or the other, bent us away from society in any genuine way, and thus a strained sincerity of being ourselves. These are what I want to do; but the truth of the matter runs  contrast to your views otherwise, which then have you twisitng and resisting your course and strides ahead.
   <br>&emsp;Pretend there are no problems, merely influence, and that you are nothing special, only yourself. All the action that is merritable, is what comes from that latter; and be it in the regard of others or you personally, it is still from you, and for that alone. If you help, entertain, or delight, so will others bring such experience down their own path. Of friends and lovers, these require little more than your complexion. "And are you trying to establish sums for the sake of a women and a few friends? Or, is it better put that such stakes seem to earn you the world, but sincerely in that, you hope to be the source of earning those friends? Why not just go right for them, as all are eligble nearby; nor is anything required beyond yourself, as is there no special benefit (in these respects) from being the ruler of the world." In fact, the reason your dreaming, is that if you are in fact all mighty in yourself, than those who are your friends will be so of who you are fully -since that is the mark which their drawn for. Yet isnt that the problem, that you must be so bold and attractive to have a sincere connection; why can you not be so in a common way? For, the insight here is that wihtout those friends and lovers, your unhappy -as this is quite a human condition. Yet, is there in fact something special about who falls in that line, or is it only fair and ripe if what you have, is to you when you are truly who you are. Theres an effect of trauma though, as who are has come into a place which it was uncomforatble being; and as you were unhappy not being with others, all while wishing to remain yourself (integrity), you held a plan which would procurr so, for at least you felt good about your destination and approach. The truth though, is that such end is not required for what you seek, which is to have friends who are so to me, truly. Not only is there unneccessary aspects in being famous, well recieve and notable to recieve friends; these are garnered by communication, similarities in tastes and trust; this is not procurred in any special way beyond you simply being comfortable. But I don't know who I am then, for, my actions are not so clear in their value, as we don't know what were fighting for. Perhaps it is so that we are without problems when we are strong and stout, but what has this to do with having  friends? Aren't my actions for the sake of those? Why is there something you have to be anyway, considering, that per a condition, it is right when you have friends: and is that strong and stout man really a requitment for those?

<div id="honestappeal">
   For the sake of a small comment, I can say with much firmness, that if the world has no problems, then we are in no need to save it, and as such offer our righthous response. Instead, we are dealt the all too honest appraisal of our worth and time, and view things in and of themselves. Being acquintained with others seems a neccesity, particularly from yoga and church; though, additional things of interest are wortwhile. Minor things such as zoom calls and off shoot meetups can be additional, though some repition is required for a lasting prescence to occrue -as you may otherwise feel like your avoiding them, and thus exempt from their wares. Still, both United and Buddha offer a pleasing and concurrent service; and although yoga is fairly expensive, so is the weekly session a great thing; and as the weather improves, we can scooter to cheap drop ins. And other invovlemtns such as the Hu gathering, or singles meetup. I make no promise of joining the compassion call tomorrow, or any day for that matter; but I do see the worth of dropping by the meditation following our yoga session, to say hi at least and establish a friendship. "One, where you could choose to arrive or not, but be fair in your return; as showing up to too little means that no impact is in place, and your return will be following a missing state, rather than one of pleasant surprise." Perhaps next week we'll plan on the compassion as well as stopping by; and regarding the coffee on wedensday, I have pretty much got what I seek; though, the brief and clean nature of it is somewhat rewarding, nor any bit overwhelming.
   <br>&emsp;I think that as we set ourselves apart, we feel there is some issue worth saving; almost as if that is our way back, as savior. It seems, on the other end mind you, that everyone is in fact fine, and proceeding abut their way; which, in an irrational sense can be contrived under the thrusts of porn, the pedantic nature of discourse, or the charming meanness of self help and schemes. Beyond that, the preferred insight is that you are only keeping yourself back, and in turn without cause or course to save anything. For instance, I look at David Hume, and how I see him I must remark how we'd be great if we were the same; yet it is not notoriety which holds our bend; but rather the actualization of work and prestige of that class; hereby we do feel well about ourselves, but it is mostly from the good we find in our work. This is not bent on what such caliber will recieve us, only that such caliber was in fact present. I feel similarly about sums, nature, rest, leisure, craft, care and film. And as there is no problem to solve, merely a strolling world, you can take these inhabits, and breeze nicely through the world, as if there were a prescence of good that earned you a smile, the freedom to see, the ease to share and openly connect. And by and large, be it for creative and exciting ends, or to do something cool and impactfull, it is through your excitement and itnerest that such actions are drawn, as opposed to a pre-requisite for seomthing meaningfull.And admittedly, I do not see that, in a volunteering sense. My life is not so positioned. And again, I have no aim or resolve to contrivance or fear, but I do see things that draw our attention. Generally, church and other kinds of gatherings, yoga as a service and cultural interest, social groups (who are local); orbiting this is select trades, workshops, atheletics, writing events or submissions, pro-active dating, communicating our memoir and interest in gaming, and perhaps other local and or foregin possibilities of where our interest could go. It is worth noting our peculiar place, in that before we wished for things which would alleivate stress in our principle ways; while now, as that princple has less reserved stakes, so are we assimilating more, and comfortably, with a future thats bright, or shining at least. So, looking at working abraod for its own sake, holds little when I consider theres no interest in leaving. In fact, it is enough for me to dream and see the bounds of Vancouver; which holds both the current place I'm at, where my family lies, and the outright beauty that is not even fully known; and even then, I am still present for those which I return to see. Theres no where special or reminsiecnet of any notoriety where you'll go; London, France, India or Japan, these are but of interest to you; yet we are already pleased, and not given much fortune more than making that interest work: it weighs comparably though to what I've already claimed. Still, that initial point was based on what may be scanned or learned of, and perhpas there is some oppertunity in Asia to study, practice and teach near and around the culturue of Yoga or Buddhism. But you can see then, that you are not running from your discontent, or moving forward for the sake of furnishing your ambitions -which are in fact only based on acquiring what is basic. Instead, theres something which you actually want to do. And I see that in Vancouver.  Although Kamlooops has its own, I see us leaving, for settling in and growing out of our place as to spread further into heavier things, takes time and thus somewhere you can extend from. This is not what Kamloops is, despite its common interests. We have low responsability though, and quite a bit of novelty and delight. Paired with our able particpants, and we are quite furnished and secure. And our writing, gaming, film and long form, stretching, running, wholeomse eating and generally flow down the dropping path, is fair and residing.

<div id="toslighten">
   I feel, perhaps, that as I am educated, with sense and of character, that other peoples suffering and or the misdeeds of others, draws my intervention. And, fairly, our generous ability is brought so much, that the motion feels good. Better yet, of praise for instance, is more drawn out from the preceding actions; whereby rest is probally all I was gratefull for following a war.
   <br>&emsp;I only mean to slighten our purpose, in that before it felt so remarkable and ordained; which admittedly came from the hopes we had from so, though this was more reflective of our wish to get the relations we seek, while in control. "As if our rise to power would attract others." 
   <br>&emsp;Without this though, it is not so clear on what we should do. One active sentiment is this notion regarding our concerns for life, rather than positon. As it were, we seem to have ambitions that reflect the response of the world around, be it of excitment or fear. But this is quite too present, and thereby drawn out to a far off end whereby those grander points can be see. I know not what lies there, for instance, in the functioning of our government, or any sound view of nuclear weaponry or global climates. I can say however, that these far off arrangments are poorly placed, and that as much as being more spread out and closer aimed makes you uncomfortable, so is that but a mark of your prevailing safe contrivances for longed desires.
   <br>&emsp;In being more loose, in that our strides are not so strictly firm and nearby, we have a longer hold in terms of where the present lies. And in that, the future seems both approachable, but closer in its absolute. "As if upon compressing the lens, more concentrated amounts of light can shine; yet, their reach is nearer than those far off extremes of entirety -which itself, was held when the lens was broad enough to cover all,but in the mere current moment." 
   <br>&emsp;All I mean to say, and I will admitt these are the regressions of a man, that in this denser yet more common state, so are our interests and scales for approval made. Our life being important, seems to offer reason and rights from Churhc, Yoga, meetups and discsussions. Trades and submission follow suite, though their place holds more saturation as time runs further ahead. In meeting that, our local life has widened, in our utility, leisure, merrit of provsions and their duty, and garnished by those surrounding affairs, and those which offer their prompts for commitment. Friendship then is consumed or desired; but in that you are without guilt or yearning impressions: for not but what could be and is, holds your mind: while a lack of that sees everything as suitable.
   <br>&emsp;The cats are old, but not yet dying; though I do see Dora going soon. Dad has surgery, followed by a May long trip. Then were able to move. They may move, and I hold no regard till the summer anyways. But I only see that as an easy transition; while otherwise, returning to a point of stbaility garnered by ourselves, and housed with all those additions seems both fair and enticing. Achievable and manageble too. Not much else is required; for our efforts for friends gives us what were internally seek; and so much as that is, or is being angled towards, so will our interest and privilage be sat on and forwarded with clear and sincere intentions. By that, we may be more open, and in turn earn the means for more; and so much as we try, we can at least feel little when we fail; for our success elsewhere is but given station, prior to that successfull attempt. In other words, whats to be expected and strode from, is that point and place which is where your forward efforts are from. And here, we have the means and ability to produce what we seek; while our success outwards is but a benefit for that, an advantage, sweetener, or right softener perhaps. But we are still otherwise fed, full and pleased. Further satiation then needs no fear, as we are already ripe; yet in that, we can at least be unreserved or afraid if an opperunity or inclination passes by, where the result is eithe rthe same -with such fineness- or we proceed -which is fairly more. But we are thus free to be the same. "As if there were a proper exchange, and all we needed and sought was present; yet additions just mean more; but so are we fine to earn only that, and not fret or be undetailed 
   about other currencies."

<div id="ourwriting">
   So we have been mending our stance on publishing, and in the shortest regards, I can say theres an oppertunity for me to try. Formality is important, and I do think some preperation, or development at least of civil writing would go along way; similar in fact to our station at church, and our interest in strenghtening our vocal quality. At any rate, the avenues seem varied; as one can have a youtube channel of these sorts, bent on varying degress of intention, so are there various outlets, and formatts at least, for we may simply submitt individual essays, or smaller parts of the collection at that.
   <br>&emsp;I can say, happily, that our understanding of the collection is that it is a cheerfull sort of reflections and deliberation. It is not so much a memoir, as it is more firm and declarative; but so are there inquiries and questions regarding the merrit and facts relevant to such judgements. 
   <br>&emsp;Furthermore, I can account for our interest in doing it at all; better yet, I'd describe our interest at the moment as one of solidifiny what we have so far said, as we can then share. On top of that, there are many things which I have not yet said; and in that course we are still thinking and defining, prior at least to our written claim. In that, if we mean to share, be it for esteem or a given prompt, those things which reflect or more forward and whole-hearted claim, is yet to come, and in prior to being stated at all. This is fine, and I am in fact quite honored and pleased with that being course. "Such objects fit my felicious stride." But regarding what we do in fact have, there is not so much clear in whats been said, as the development there is more in line with tuning of instruments, whereupon we practice with them then create. The point being, that what we had to work with, or fiddle around prior to firm statements, was impure itself, or untuned as it were. There are notes though, and many songs which have come as both a youthfull result of our more integrated times. And, right now, I am finding that such tunes and rhymes or pleasing to remedy, and at least fortify into something beyond their rambling selves. In that, there is actually much which has been said; or, to continue the analogy, much which has been played. Naturally, as remakrs any in a novice step, our furthest products were reminsinect of any equally novice form of labor. Not so much to do with the ability reached, but our sense and interest as reflects our coming course, has me tending back to the steps prior, and at least tying them up as to be more complete, albeit of a partial self -or novice rather.
   <br>&emsp;Our strides then color themselves with the interest of care and esteem, whereby the ideas we have, and within their written form, breathes more life and reaches towards more in its shine: thats our stride. But the object of this is unclear; for we are not so privy to money's offer, nor are we looking for some resounding affect. In fact, I see the world broken up in both an overarcing civil layer, and that of the commons; yet in each, there are seperations of judicious, industrious and playfull sorts; and all so with nodes and sectors, or families if you will. I see our route not so much in finding who will bring me across the masses, but rather that one, be it the leader or member, who ingratiates me into their particular strand, due to our work resignating, and the interest to incorporate and extend its effects within such strand. "As if we had accounting skills, and someone, seeing the use and value, brought said person in to display such skills, and therein further the group through this newly fitted stride." Thats where I should go. And be as it may, but starting there in a smaller kind, will breathe more life and station into your steps, whereby the light they cast will be to others in their own kind, and so forth. 
   <br>&emsp;A team unites to form a buisness, which then influences of buisness of that kind; these then spread to other types of buisness in that field, in that a class of sports coaches translates to the class of personal training, and there on to the field of fitness and health in general. And upon reaching those civil heights, to all below will it rain. This is our objective at least, for it more plainly reflects our strides of esteem and oppertunity. Because our aimed is banked little on money though, or wandering hopes for infamy and posterity, or fears of insecurity and integrity, the objective holds less concern or deliberate routes for the masses; or the idea of the broader public. Instead, we care more about the ideas and their esteem, or value rather, and as such, where theres room and reason to try -as our strid is marbled with little fear of dissapointment- we go for the hope and claim of instigating such result; which, as fitting, finds itself so in a smaller, personal, common level group; which, in circumpsect, can be soley from yourself, whereby you present yourself and share. Or, in the case for yoga, you are at least sound to feel known and fitting as your true selve, a good one, which itself sprouts from that care and concern for words and ideas; and, similarly, our stride of principle and living has objects of a similar accord; be it in those groups which you acclimitate towards and contribute, or those  mere invovlements whereby the common affairs and practices of character are shown. One, remakrs further life in what you have so far become; while the other, affords more for you to take in, or be present towards; as a bar is unfitting, so are those which are so, because you can truly be, take in and recalibrate; and otherwise, they may actually approve of your offer, or humor it at least, whereby more is done. And we fear not, because, the worst, is that we go back to living is we happily find, and breathing our own light; church and community bare warmth and structure towards this, while those objects of oppertuinty and esteem, flourish on your constanty ability and openess as comes from such habitation.

<div id="upanddown">
   Things are well, though my short prescence stops me from seeing all of it. In that, we long for things which would relieve us; or better said, our natural condition feels like something were bracing for, rather than striding along, with tender strenght. By that, we are somewhat outside ourselves, unable to draw our taughtness and sensibility; whereby our fortune feels more weighing, thus drawing our gaze outside to further things, or at least places and scenarios with less strain. Oddly, this feeling has no real place, for virtue has us content with the muck that we have, nor is there much dispostion or experience that says we are permanetly short. In that, theres fleeting hopes as to relive our muddied state; but due to our aim elsewhere, or at least unhumored oblige, we feel absent of those things -ie. people, travel and infamy. 
   <br>&emsp;Now, over the years this up and down pace has had me somewhat stultify those latter interests; which in terms of how they were viewd, was fine. Only, in the recent days, they have governed a more homely interest. That is, in our time so far, we've leaned too much on perfection; and so those things of interest and desire felt contrary, or scrutiably unimportant. Only now, our need to be so perfect has reduced, and at any rate, the more appropriate manner in which we pursue and enact ourselves, holds ample room for those other interests. 
   <br>&emsp;For so long those priorities of ours were banked on reaching something far; or at any rate, developing those efforts to be so well, that there aim of according gains was wise to infer. As their stakes lowered, our life could gain more fertile traction; and as it were, we went from an inconsistent perfection, to a regular period of greatness, satisfied with merely good, more void of bad, and easier achievments and progress to an accumulative acclaim, all while bolstered and engraved to the warmth of community, its structure, and the affibility and steadfastness to oppertunity and friends. As it were, we use to make the heartiest of steps, but would eventually come down to something either absent or subpar, all before waring ourselves thin in the return to such might. Whereas now, we take comparable strides, though more evenly paced; and when were done, we have more ease in sinking back a little, along with being more content and pleased in our common attentions. Thust, we graze more woafully, then return to that ample state; which, in its own way, stands on more even ground, as compared to those perfect strides which had to begin their actions on the rubble of inconsistency. In effect, we take more stpes as we take less futile breaks; and due to this consistency, our paces are done more meaingfully, as their advance is not from a return, but continuation.
   <br>&emsp;In summary, I have not been to church in two weeks; nor was I able to go to Shambhala. It, along with Yoga were missed due to the weather, but I must then reflect that being somewhat absent, comparably at least to the two weeks prior, has me feeling this seperate haze; which, although not a detriment, as our normal pace is quite plain, so are we more recessed and driven to be with ourselves: which is itself a ridge that passes us along to those required perfections, and according futility. Showing up then seems to major task, as reception is quite circumstantial; and at any rate, your communication can be easy and swell, be it forwardly or in response. Like a relationship, it takes time to build, and the worth comes from doing so. At least, you can attest to your less than eager state, or at least the disposition and integration that has not normalized itself. Our pace is not re-routing, as the truths which brought us here remain. I am merely reflecting the differemce, as if the choice was not ours and we are simply apprecitaive of our return, or at least what this prevention held us from.

<div id="markofsuccess">
   Consistency, or constancy as those aspiring refer, could not be overvalued as a marker of success. In fact, as positivty roots itself as the core factor of aims, so would constancy calibrate the peculiar truth of any given subject.
   <br>&emsp;Regarding Men, we state that the former principle neccessitates that a result will be bent towards something positive, at least. The point being, that whether it is thievery or philanthropy, that the end would at least be a good one; which, as it happens, further justifies itself under the regularity, flavor and ease of the result. Here then consistency lies. For none would argue that a result was superior if it in fact held less frequency and ease; and in terms of one's ability to procurr so, can more or  less be decided on the congeniality of themselves and the operation at hand, and judged whether such pairing, and of that fruitfull kind, is consistent.
   <br>&emsp;In other words, the general posivitvity in which all things are aimed, and the properties of frequency, substance and simplicitiy which refine the quality of such results, specifies itself under any given scenario, by judging somethings worth, or affibility in a given case, as to whether their nature and that of the conduct, is consistent enough to procurr those defined factors. Perhaps, in a word, consistency is so, that if one were to partake in a venture, that their results would be regular, pleasing and efficient. In that, we would say that something was not consistent if in fact the result diverged from such properties. 
   <br>&emsp;Put another way, the elements of success are so, that no matter the scenario, that all ends would hold such complexions. This is an overacving mold, with positivty being the foremost, and frequency, substance and ability reflecting the meat of the matter. But general no less. What constancy refers to, is along the lines of screening, or inquiry at least, as to what things one ought to do; under the notion that, those which we choose, were so, seeing as our amendment to such would lead to a solid affair with the highest kind of end -in that it held those qualities. In short, what I can do well is that what I can do consistently; and that what I ought to do, or must do, is that which I cannot be inconsistent with, without ceasing those qualities on our basic level. For instance, we must breathe by virtue of lacking any frequency of life when we do not.
   <br>&emsp;I think the idea is a sound one, but needs more plotting. At any rate, I would conclude on this speculative summary, which is constancy's place as a determining factor; as if we were to decide which acts we would partake within the realm of all acts, and how they are generally defined against those core properties -of frequency, flavor and ease.  Constancy is the scale by which we judge what things we could forever partake, in order to reach those goods of general quality.

   So for many years I dreaded the winter, as time would feel so still, and our anticipations, or lacking, would be more weighing on me. In that, I always looked forward to the summer; and at any rate, planned things accordingly to its arrival, and otherwise avoided trasnitioning or committing to things amidst the winter.
   <br>&emsp;Now, I can fully see that the colder months are not lacking in goodness, nor are their setbacks that severe. In fact, the extreme cold of december is comparable to the extreme heat of July: but these are to natural and thus fair. At any rate, our time has improved whereby the colors and temperature of the year don't impact us in any significant way. I am sure that if this were to retract, then the closed in points of winter would feel as they once did. But our constance is upward in that sense. Moreover, in regards to the actually good, or sweetness of the year, so do those shivering months have their own strands. As it were, the land becomes barren, lifeless, thin; yet, in that, the sun, and all light in general, penetrates everything to a vibrant effect. Such saturation makes the evenings glow, and the mornings. This compounded with the general briskness and 'icy moor' appearl of the cold, makes for something, albeit crisp and in need of bundling, is quite fresh and exact. While the summer months have a more radiating haze, these cooler months offer ones which harsh edges, but of a pleasing and shiny sort. It is true that the joys of spring carry over into the summer; but my point overall is that the lows of winter are not as much when we are clear in our sight, nor are their highs that low, considering the vibrancy on display. 
   <br>&emsp;In effect, the fall has nothing sparse about it, as its depletion of life, in itself a great scene, has no coming detriment; so you may incorporate to the retreat of life, bare its fairness, thank your own commisery, and otherwise enjoy. In that, be it the outgrowth into spring or the midst of summer, theres nothing to work around; for what is good is always around the corner; nor is the advance into milder times so unfavarable, that you directly defer from it, or come short of the ease required (during it) to see the spring ahead. All is the same then. Not worth unaccounting for, but nothing to hold you back, or feel like a stop is coming. It is true that this year had but a minor stretch (and a late one at that) of cold then snow; but prior to that, the times were pleasant, and quite open in their offers -as their severities were not at all prominent. And even now when they are, like the heat it is but a temporary phase, so do the pleasing hues remain.

<div id="thefront">
   I can see three elements of my life, those being health, committments and industry. That former, is utmost in the most basic of ways; as our negligence of the latter two don't permitt any slack in this. That is, if we are free enough not to worry about activity or friends, so are we still subject to the approval by our fitness. In that, I see how substance will accrue and our natural standards will accomodate. As it stands though, if those measures are not so severe, you still have industry in mind; for if our state of exercise permitts a great deal of starch and grain, so do our creative activites suffer. That being said, the need for such activites to be in place, and somewhat prominent, is dictated by the abscene of other pleasures and security. At the very least, it seems, our release from perfection allows us to attend other services and events, and from that be seen, and at least proposed -as to give something to look forward to, some structure. And so our liberal efforts have more room, beyond the width, to act as we truly seek, as their bend is not so twisted for the hopes and aspiration of grandiosity or non-idleness. 
   <br>&emsp;What I am noticing though, is that as those warming committments take place, and our leiusre affords more permission, so does the lack of clarity to those liberal ways draw an interest in the fruits of those social attendances. There, a pleasure unlike that of liberality is shown, and we are not struck to another path as not to be sparked by it. 
   <br>&emsp;I think we've begun to realize that things are good when they are in and of themselves. And as we are fit, so can the extent of that comply. We're just simply outside the realm of reservation, procastination or excuse, and as such, can move more freely and a foresight of preferred action, 'rather than the promise of beginning'. But in this, we are not so sure what were doing, or why at any rate. There is this element of sameness, in that our time of relaxation sees those social comforts, but lacks any regard or sense as to their requirments. And that cannot be an unimportant point; as despite our current invovlement with industry and craft, so is their a general favor when it comes to them, as compared to the committment of furthering those social ends. This isn't to say that time and sincerity won't procure such forms of that end; but to see so without considering the extent to which you'd go, in its ease that is, and whether or not you can spare the time, is folly.
   <br>&emsp;Were still making something up, as if there isn't something pleasing already. In reality, the warmth of another, and of an intimate sort beyond the common comforts of friends, is within the range of our severed reservations. The notion of travel though, or the paired fantasy of notoriety and its offer, seem outside of this realm. This seem more like fiddling motions, or idly drawn ones at least. Whereas those other feel more like improvements that can be targeted, and born for the sake of your life. "While those other foreign and exocitc ones, seem more like a life in its own, but farther, and with the hope that you'd reach. While our current stead, is one that removes the constrictedness from such intent, and otherwise allows for liberty to go as she's meagerly pleased, while you fortifiy and bend through the life currently around you; whereby the hope for honesty and friends is recieved."
   <br>&emsp;In other words, the ability to garnish a home, is simple; as is the acquisition of love and friends but an itinery's respect away: for in that you can see, and are knonw. Nor is the development of a craft a massive effort; for with the right selection of both growth and trade, so can you be prompt to the integration that the internet rewards; whereby you can in a similar fashion become known, and thereby ask, explore, and trend towards points and positions that will give you substanct and posterity. In regards to books and travel, I cannot say the latter is cheap, or without seperation if you amend to its offer; while the former seems limited only by your fear of dissapointed, and ability to write a letter. Content in general seems the reward those who are consistent; and seeing as this is an evergrowing spot for oppertunity and fufillment, an inch is substantial. It seems beneath this sits our integral means and delighted ends; at least our leisruely and past times which have no short ease or amount to offer. But far in front, sees perhaps window dressings of these elements, which lose their non-competivieness, natural attitude and gait, and overall personal, directed and unimposed figure. That is the problem with women, money, travel and acclaim. As in the going to dinner, riding in a car, sitting in chairs, or meagerly submitting your books, offering your interests, sharing your hobby or creation, none are bad. But in a state which is either too idle and stiffened, so do we magnify where those front end things go, and thus stretch out our common steps in the back. "Which in effect, gives them less room to wander and grow."
   <br>&emsp;The problem though, is that as the front has governed mroe width, and accordingly settled, so are we unsure where our efforts should go, or at least what objectives we should have. I may be nieve, but relations are not built past much more than similarity and connection; and being open seems the limit of that, rather than the shortcomings of which someones fears may see you as having. The honest remark of me from another is the scale by which our own remarks align. This takes time though and familiarity. And, nicely, this is no problem, as our posture and pace is not so hasty or in drought; as we otherwise show up with ourselves, happy, pleased, and in effect honest. This is merely a point for cheer, which in my regards seems sufficient as a general point of secutiy, but also intimate promise. I would say, in effect, that our reservations from the back, magnify the heights of our life in front, if and only if to allow for such pleasires to accrue. For we dont really mean to travel, but if it seems like we'd be more desirable for another, then to that pleasure I move. And at any rate, I am jealous from the view of another going, 'as if they have such magnified riches'. In effect, our drawn out ends afford our own hopes to be spread out and stiff, and also subject to comparison and self invovlemtn, whereby the in fact regal motion of someone, in travel or in their buinsess, is not in fact so grand and remisniscnt of what you've dreamed. And you feel unneccarsily inferior. Perhaps an overall sentiment from our rounded place, which is not so dug or or drawn out, but more promptlya  and plumply abounds in its front and back. An overall view of our life then may seem important; as their may feel like things ought to be done, as reflect that truth: which our new found stability and happiness is keen to respect: yet the demand is not clearly known. "So our intent is to later define this."

<div id="afirmself">
   So theres this ppint of frustation that often comes up during suggestions, where you here 'just do it, look over there how great so and so is', along with comparisons of others who are. My issue, is that theres a rose tinted glasses effect, almost as if the vision being professed is coming from a place which has no color itself. Of course over there is fine; and how could it not be, when our current spot has nothing comparable. "As those who are in fact there an accompanied, settle into what is present, and otherwise look at the colors elsewhere." 
   <br>&emsp;In that though, I see little of importance in any unique way. All that really changes is the flavor of imagery and activity; but in all places are these things still found. Nor, in all likelihood, have you experienced all, or incorporated what your current position has. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, I see little importance for the sake of these varying hues, as no where, and in fact where we are, lacks any vibrance itself: and so it all feels novel.
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, the suggestion of working online, or furthering your civil stead, is one that fairs benefit in all regards, despite the unneccesary transition. That is, even if the far of promise of adventure and change is in fact breif and comparable, so in your own familiar state is their room for improvemnt. For as we said, in our land there is much to see, be it new or mariniating. But so do the civil elements of the wprld smear this, or at least bend your able ways. 
   <br>&emsp;Our course of effort though is one that submitts to priority; for as we said, of course I'd like to be King of England, as the lack of labor and access to wherever I seek, would in fact confurr pleasures and scenery. Yet such a post is both heavy and distant as it is large. And regarding our actual purpose, it is to live well; and in that, there is not much which is exclusive. Yet, in that register of spots, despite their fair fit of you as a man, so are you subject to the requirments of being one. Here, the civil reality of trade, buisness, liberty and recreation come into play. "And some angles are preferable over others."
   <br>&emsp;Values come into play though, as our common life of industry and care, surely improves when our means for provision are acquired more gently and efficently. While, someone may have a more equitable stance on their life, but work more to provide it: still, such means may be more lucrative, however much more their demands are. 
   <br>&emsp;My point, is that as a man, I see, and so much as I am unhindered do I heed such prompts. Hereby, we are not working to remove troubles, or survive at any rate, but using our time, with fecundity, bearing down on nothing more than that which draws the beat of our heart, some craft in our pace.
   <br>&emsp;Seeing as their are conditions, we can define the removal of those as freeing; while the harmony and grace within the duties you have, can be liberating: as they don't weigh you down, or cause struggle, and despite being present, are not a burden. In effect, I see the former improvement as one wihch expands what you can see, for you are relieved fundamentally; while the latter, holds more means for you to actually respond. "For you may see the whole world in all your kingship, but be unable to at all treat it; while those, more common, may not be able to see everything to its greatest extent, but so can their harmony with such demands, confer the liberal means for generous effort: whereby, onto what stands shorter than that which can only be seen on those high towers, earns a larger treatment." In a word, freedom is made by managing the world, as we contrive and alter as to find a better angle, whereby we improve the levelness of our place. Whereas liberality remarks the man, the use, the sentenced; as their poor response to riches yeilds according results, while those who treat even the gravest of threats well, keep their hearts full and beating. "And thats what we care about, our meausre, the scale for approval." And the point is nto that freedom is irrelevant, but that ultimately, our death and civil lives always remain, to which our response is needed. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps that is a developmental insight, whereby our submission to a given requiremnt of strenght, in that it is a statr which is needed, reveals to me how things are and who we should be while I am so appropriate. If we were compeltely free, and perhaps farily as our oblige to death did not appear as someone ignored trouble, then maybe our composure would need little. But even then, what would we seek? For the point is not that we'd go away, as respiration would still be refreshing, as would sugar taste sweet. And even if there were no consewuences for to much of one and too little of the other, so would be be subject to a preferred experience? Maybe not, as that somewhat suggests that there are confinements which mark a nature and its congenial way. But so could we rest on the predicate given by bodies, in that they would be exposed to the world in a consequential way, in and how they (the bodies) were material. In that we can say that we are; and the notion of being exempt from freedom, suggests that you are not. But in that, there is not an experience to be had: at least there is no beat of yours to move from: particularly in that there is no one (in your abscence) to respond. "And neither that or the exemption from advancing (forward as compared to receptiopn) can be so (absent), and life have any presence -for those things would then be there."
   <br>&emsp;Breifly, I can say that our liberal interests are more clearly so, and thus without the direst need to make us free. In that, we can afford more regard for things which would in fact relieve us. Nor, to my point, is that with any compramise for those liberal ends. Had perfection been their right, then so would all things contrary fail; yet it is not so, but only where our definite mark heeds the inspired taste which strikes our treated heart. That is fine, meaningfull and subsistent. The concern though, is how much other things require, in that you surely can see improvements there as you would the sweetness of sugar; and while that latter still sits outside our functioning realm, so is the comittment and profit from furthering our profession or craft within our bounds. 
   <br>&emsp;Admittedly, we are mixed in terms of our pure efforts, as their roots are in acquiring the lenenacy to do them. And although that severity has reproached, or more gentle efforts still hold our indsutrious gate. In our fatigue, we in fact have a weary heart, rather than a beating one. I won't speak to others suggestion, but I can at least say that freedom feels desired; for our return seems to require it. But, as we said, that absent state is more than no from a hasty and strenuous attempt to be with it more. "Which brings you to an eventual stop." What I can say of this, is that as our sight has opened, so have we seen what was previously held from fear of missing that relief, and otherwise pinned under our procastination. In that our writing stands and its earnest submission. Yet in that, I see much patience, repose and civility in making such attempts: the campaign of which, we wear has me pruning to forog. I have not the steadfastness or moral gait to proceed; as this feels like a chore. This is so, again, because our ease of effort is quite low, particualry in this vulnerable states where you route to success is in trying repeatedly, but with a tender confidence that merely seeks to promulgate, but holds no ends so dear that your afraid to hear critique, dissmisal, or a further call to effort. We need to reach there and we simply are not. I can say, in circumspect, that our efforts down this course are coming together for this point of submission to occur. But as we are tired, so is it not so easy to try; and in that, we are also working on things in the meantime; at least so much as our gentle approach is out of reach, so is our moment of focus too burdened with idle work and progress. For there is much to do; at least, when I think of the substance which centers within those outward effords, there is room to grow. Yet, beyound perfection and our more common piece, it is that outward edge of sincerity, promulgation, steadfastness and personal insight (as to the importance of spreading our ideas), that marks the challenge at had. For in that, you must be bold and establioshed, but lightly and within the broadest sort. That is hard to reach when we are in fact so stirn; and although our general breadth and lightening has reveald these spots to me, and preliminariyl progressed, so is the home stretch of it outside our bracing realm.
   <br>&emsp;Sending letters should be easy, as there is no test in question, or means rather, but the end itself, whereby you implore whats signifanct: succeeding in your attempt to solidify the life you've already had. Whereas a profession brings room to acquire such life, be it in liberality or experience. And admittedly, our strain within our hidden attempts to liberally succeed, does have me unprivy to the elegance that is only required to further its claim. Your alright though. Theres no one asking you for much. Nor is the need for furthe expansion a pressing one. And, in its case and that of our creation, so are details and alignment a natural guarentee to succeed, particualry when you have that strenght and elegance to move forwardly through it. I only can consider that in this worn out statte, that we cannot see our life in general; as if those most concentrat points loosened up, found their place, and we were otherwise left more expressed, open, meaning to love. And by that, there is room for freedom to have benefit, and for us to see as such and punctually amend. Were just where we are though, reaching a point where the world is no longer on our shoulders. "In our reprieve and might, ought we merely stand."
</div>
<div id="hardends">
   The developental approach is a hard one, for you at most reflect on what you've experienced so far, and conclude based on that. This is in contrast to a theoretical approach, whereby you amend yourself based on rules: yet of what origin I do not know.
   <br>&emsp;Our reflective course is one that affords itself a plain product, particularly so due to its respect for subjects. That is, it knows little what nature wants, but at least knows what nature is; and in effect, she asks us nothing more than to respond to whats in front of us. And, as it were, our gravest fear is one of idle definitions, whereby our lack sees that local scenario as a burden. Thereby we want more, and thus we search for something beyond natures personal pledge to us, and instead her absolute state: as if we could then amend to that. 
   <br>&emsp;Foremost, is this a false hope, however understandable. But concerning whether or not is true, is where I struggle. For be it lack of our own definitions, or the struggle to even question what has yet to be clearly identified, our mind, the notion of an afterlife, and the origins of things outright, holds no conclusive place. 
   <br>&emsp;Where I struggle though, is that we are not simply adhering to what we feel to be true, but rather are questioning what that actually is. If it were true that our deaths held no judgement, and that our lives were at best configured in preferable ways, but no less of material substance, then I would, albeit limited in said material, be fair to question and resolve based on what is at hand. That is the purpose of subjects, for just as I know that red and blue differ in view, despite their unknown source, so do I know what I, as a subject, am as a man. In a word, if the whole of things is unknown, I at least can attest to the respiratory nature of a fish compared to a mammal. As things, I am doubtfull, but only on the basis of things: not the subjects. For again, we are merely attributing our worth and aims via experience. And even then, if death were passing judgement, so would that be more for us to amend to. The concern, or impediment, is in the questioning, whereby we don't know what we are even subject to. For even death would be another subject, as our mind is its product of nature's mystery. The problem though, is in the subjects. For just as hot has an effect, on us particularly, and that of cold, what is death, definitively? These curisoities sit humbly nearby the more firm and explicity truth of all things, but so is that fair for us to be unprivy too, or reproached towards. What I cannot do is overlook the nature of death, as can I not mistake the constancy of the world for something otherwise. Only, it seems at best understandable how this far peaks of inquiry, seek the absolute truth; as if the fruits of death and constancy would be hung down from comparable heights, that instead of reaching up higher, we could merely reach below from that highest peak. At this point though, we have lost reproach, and more or less abandoned an approach which better remarks the truth, in figure at least; nor are we even amending to our local affairs, per our nature as ones not from above. 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, what I am saying is that as far as proposals go, we are wrong. But in that, I am not suggesting we make proposals, but definitions rather. For no one amends to breathe, and thus makes no proposal for it. It is for things unknown which we do such things, as if a proposition which is bent on moving towards somewhere not yet known. Yet, I know not one question which is merritable beyond the truth in all things. However, in that case, we are mistaken to poorly suppose what such truth consitutes, at least without any rigor or fidelity in what its nature reflects. The point then, is that if that sole question is unknown, and our resolve to forgo dillusion holds our moment in not posturing as if we then know, then the concern for our action is how we should be without such a firm heading? That is the place for subjects then, as they, despite being unprivy to that bearing, hold relevant evidence to the nature of things in their active way. By which our thought and regard are included, and thus this inquiry and resolution. And, it is my opinion, that the reason we are so unsettled in being in this middling state, or reproached one at least, is because the impetus for wishing for truth is bound in seeking a definiton of death. Nothing more. Constancy itself even wouldn't provide this, for this at best amounts to a convincing argument that says that it (being death) could not be anything more than material, for no testimony or reasoning could suggest that things were ever inconstant; which rightly outlaws contrary's, or things which trigger inconstance, which intervention and spirits are signed.
   <br>&emsp;Simply, our definition for death is all we seek. And fairly, we might say that it is what marks our end, and thus our wish to exceed it. But this may only be so if we attest to it well, in that if it were judgement being passed, then so would our proper oblige see us pass that mark; or if it was into nothing, well so is that with its own amend: but each to pass the mark. I mean not unwind old definitions, rather I merely wish to say that what is true is in fact irrelevant, as all we really seek are the aspects most relevant to us. Imagine, if their were beings superior to us, or at least subject to conditions and ends that were more substantial that ours. Consider our nature and ways comapred to a rock, and consider us as the latter. Now, if the truth in things did in fact detail the meaning and according response for those higher, so would that same truth offer us the same. Yet, what I see, simply, and again I mean not to build up the strenght which sprouts this, but rather I only seek to explain, that such end for us, is in fact lower than what the truth in things curtails; and by that, we can know all that is worth knowing, fairly, effectively, and happily: but without the need for all, to be our scale. 
   <br>&emsp;And the trickiest thing, is in explaining why an apple is fair to be described as something as it it simply is, yet doing so without knowing the truth in things, of which it is: whereby our similar definition of death, from ignorance alone,simply holds no common description (or of subjects) like the apple, even if for both the truth is unknown.

<div id="partandwhole">
   So I mean not to use phenomena in the Kantian sense, but that of a mystery. "Some far off light, or disturbance: that is phenomena." For one reason or the other, we tend to attribute mystical meanings to such things; while science and inquiry has progressively shown such notions to be wrong. Now, the problem, is that the whole of things is not subject to such knowledge, or clarity rather. No one truly believes, or rightly even, that the winds are the breath of God, but rather is due to the atmosphere, weather and climate in general. And in a word, this tightening of truth has spread across the bulk of the world, whereby what was once attributed to whimsy and mind, is now known to be a normal working of nature. The question though, is where she comes from? For in our own ultimate concerns, where does that align?
   <br>&emsp;What speaks to me in this regard, is that within our limit of the whole, we still act as though its subjects are of the common sort. Again, this has developed, whereby the use of rocks was likely never mistaken for God, but the weather perhaps, or illness at least. "Those things so beyond our sight, that only a mystery could show." In that sense, my querry is onto the furthest definitions wholly relevant to us. For just as red and blue are given relvant distinctions and natures, despite their limit within the unknown whole, why is death not goverened in the same way. If I removed all your electrons and bone, what would remain? You might say it was your soul, and further than that you may have a similar, but seperate, notion of the mind, as if either or both would remain. Yet I would still ask whether or not you could see, smell, breathe, feel heat, cold, sweetness; whether their could be anticipation -as measured by the beat of your heart- or aprrehension -by the tightening of your aims. If all this were absent, and your mind and soul were merely subject to what rest outside what your body delivered, what exactly would that mean. How would their be color, touch, any relevance or material that colored us with foresight or memory. In other words, what would our experience be like outside the body, when all things that we could imagine have no house to express them? "That is, how could heat be experienced, when the moment of heat is from the impartion of a source onto a body: less your mind gets hot." 
   <br>&emsp;And this is all considering the admission of mind and soul, beyond vision, speech, or the products of neurology: that beat of our heart even and all its flutters. I can't even depict what it would be like for such entity to exist outside of a material realm. And, fairly, I give little regards to material representiion, as in the contents of dreasm, and their supposed place for our mind to go. "Because the abscence of material is in no part a place where material has but mere figures, but bare. That doesn't seem to be what the wilds of matter contain."
   <br>&emsp;The problem is in our definition of mind. Even if there was an afterlife, so would our view of it being one where we inhabit some new experience, that feels slightly folly. At least the truth in it is not so comparable to such whims. But explaining then why it is something other than what feels expected of nature, is a struggle. Yet, in my own case, I see that natural description as fair; and so much as my life is garnered by wisdom and development, so are such natural ends the most favorable. For who would not want a state of peace and rest, where fear and doubt had no entrence. And even if joy and pleasure had no admission as well, so is the state of rest not tampered: for those former are not the elements of rest. In our life, the experience of such motions are what give us temporry rest, as we either settle from completed action, or sleep. But in that, such moments are in fact so preferable, for they only come when our acts of living are good, and done at that. "For my easily come to a slow, relinquishing our haste and settling in, as our prior motions have reached their mark, and our need for motion is on hold." That is the nature of bodies, they wish to move, or be even. And when they don't we feel anxious, like our inactivty is wrong. So would the abscence of a body remove that need for motion then. "Hence the salavation from this embodied world." Yet the promise of what comes after, as if our experience will be like that of a body, only without its ware. The folly in this is in thinking that the elements which are privy to a body would in fact be present when the body wasn't there. This affords no strenght in right belief, or deeming likely. What I would say instead, is how your mind and soul are when your sleeping, tranquily and freely; reminiscent lets say of bodily wisdom, whereby the choices we made served it, in the avoidance of gluttony lets say, whereby it can more easily settle, whereby its grunging need to move is no longer, and in fact our embodiment is one that happily rests -of a body'd kind that is (as comapred to the pure abscence of death). Now, think of your mind and soul and how it is when the burden that it normally has -of being embodied- is in fact administered well, and the tears of such condition are tempered. In that, our condition is comparable to death, as we are in fact without our body, in flavor at least -as it is at rest, albeit living. My only point, is that if there are desired ends of the body, yet our fear of what happens when the body is gone holds us back, so could we consider how our comparable living state to such end is in fact so pleasurable, or nice at least, that reaching said state is not worth worrying about. As most peopple have, such a transition will be a relief, into an ocean of drifting senility. Yet, it is only a developmental view that can procurr such excitment. For it is within our wisdom that our lifes actions bend us towards favorable ends. But, whereas death is final and lasting, so is our life more like a wave, whereby even our strongest repose will be subject to some moment or condition; and however well we respond, so is their a need for one. The point, is that in those moments where you do well, and your treated to a complete action and the means for rest, so can you see how this compares to your final death. And as it were, your mind is encaged by the body, and thus your choice to or wish to remove this condition is not a fair one; at least it is more of a constrained and anxious thought, as the bodies dissmisal of it holds more sway. Yet, we can helm ourselves with insight and fortuity, as to make our living condition better, and otherwise remove the impetus of where it is going: for we know how our momentary experiences of rest will forever compare. Better yet, as you relate such bits of time to those of finality, so can such moments of insight illimuate the wonders and awe of your actual living. Whereby, the struggle of living not only levels out -and affords comparison to death- but so does it become more worthwhile; so that your wish to die now as to remove the burden (however futile) is not so present, and instead, your wish to live is the imperative, and freely too, as the end by which it makes is not one to worry about. Nor should you feel like your mistaken, or arriving at that entrence unequiped. "That is only the concern for those who intend to continue living. While nothing asks for not."

   The strenght I have in believing the plainess of death, comes from our otherwise settlement of nature's register. Simply, the weather is not made on a whim, and we know this; nor is the belief otherwise a fair one. Now, there is this needed notion for the sake of our limit, or progress rather, whereby we assign that natural gate to the climate as constant, as opposed to altering and commanded. This, is not why the winds are not governed by Gods; only, in seeing how their effects come from certain causes, so can we say that its constance is apparent. This is in contrast to a concieved notion that all is constant, and thus weather being a thing applies. In a word, a priori is not our point here, but of experience. The term constance though is what were trying to append. But of things not experienced, that is hard too do. Yet, all we are tasked with doing is actually trying to give detailed assessments for what do in fact know, and at any rate can presume. For you see, death may not be something we can reflect on, so deeply that, but so are our assumptions and illusory definiitions equally false. And by point of removing weakness', our stable strenght can come from simlpy helming the proper terms.
   <br>&emsp;It seems a given that our mind is attributed to some holly sector of our regard, and in our idling ways, we assume that this covered end will in fact bend it (our mind) into some comfy existence.
   <br>&emsp;What we must removed though is in thinking that things which are certainly not of the mind, will in fact be present in that following state. This, in short, is to distinguihs the loopiness by which we lable our thoughts and sense, and that of vision, touch, smell and vitality. These, like the weather, have common and natural explanations, and are not some phenomena for us to ardently suppose. And the point, is that within our inquiry, we will not assume that a realm of unbodily existence will include the products born only of bodies. We may at this point hold onto the mental elements which are for all intensive purposes ambigious, but so would we be wrong in thinking that where our death takes us, would hold either an environemtn that was comparable to one inhabited by the sun, or that we could experience heat in the way that kinectics do to a body.
   <br>&emsp;Where I struggle is in thinking whether or not our thoughts are somehow exclusive to the worldly realm, and are but seperate things which inhabit our bodies and leave upon it's dispersal. Again, beyond rebirth, the notion of the afterlife, in this sense, is one which regards our continuation; as if the self of our body moves on when the latter is gone. And again, we are making the note that the abscence of those body faculties will yeild according abscences. There are many questions then as to where our mind goes, and what that experience is like. And at any rate as the history of thought has dealth us, so is our mind a subject like anyother, who is supposedly subject to judgement. That is, be it seperate from the body. or the whole thing going through, there is still this idenitiy which we are, as either mental facultites and or the mixings of body faculties, which both act as members for entry into that afterlife. This is a difficult thing to explore, for it in many ways holds two loosely defined truths: one being the case for judgement, and our otherwise place as one's being judged. For it may be true that we are sentenced to some sort of end following death, but so may it be one of a resonant comfort and warmth, as compared to a resonant pain and grief. This contrasts with the lively view of an afterlife, where instead of being resonant -like our dreamless sleep is- it is more like a play, where we are either prisoners in a red hot dungeon, or are guests of a white light resort. If there is judgement, it may direct us to either kind.
   <br>&emsp;What I believe otherwise, or what I mean to speak about, is the notion of parts, and how some are a given in how they are conducted and produce; and at any rate, if our mind is unknown in its entirety, so is the end in which it goes, still one where it is solely itself, and into a realm which amounts to all but what it particulalrly is. In that, if there is no kinectics, then their is no common effect of heat; nor would the abscence of matter confer any effective weight or physicality. In a word -while dismissing rebirth- our approach here is not one where the mind is an animaotor, of our body in this worldy case, that upon its seperation from it, goes on into another body, of another world, but one which is reminisscent of a dream, whereby the sun there is merely a figure, and that the bodies in mention are more like they are in our imagination, compared to those which are physical and current -whereby our death pulls our minds from. This is not what I suppose, or base my thinking on. When we die we are not entering a play. Rebirth is besides the point, as it too enters back into the real world, or at any rate goes into a realm with bodies of its own sort. But so far as the heat of fire impacts our skin, and our mind is but a witness to the body which it inahbits experiencing such pain, we are not of the view, or on the side of, that our time after death is of a ppsitivite or negative form of unphysical bodies, yet comparable to what they are in the real world. That is, there is no mental form of fire which our hellish sentence can subject us to, for our mind is not what fire can burn. This looks past the notion of introduced experiences, but only because are'nt consider neurology and kinectics as relatable to the minds nature. It is but an agent which animates bodies that are subject to such thing. And our only point, is that the nature of death which we are given or judged by, is not one that holds the effects of bodies, without the properties and constuct of those bodies being there. Or at any rate, we don't believe that we will be part of a dream. For even that seems to be absent when our actual body is truly at rest; and our abscence from it is in fact a total purity of that sort. "Whereby our living state seceds out of its bodily dreams, and into a state of ease and rest; as if our body is becoming in its own right absent (as comapred to haste) and, in effect, dips its toes in the pools of nothing. The point being that when our literal toes are gone, that we are seeped in the blood of that pool." And my stance, or lens at least I look through, holds us either as fish, or not, within an empty sea. Or, better said, our death does not bring us to eternal realm of Atlantis, but rather a place which does not invite or permitt the impression of light, heat, fear and breathe.
   <br>&emsp;That is my sense of death, in its product at least. And fairly, the notion of judgement, as if the abyssal pool we were in was one of tar as opposed to dark crystal, is not one with any real substance. Even the protestants felt that heaven or hell was there for all: and thats saying quite a bit when their playfull view of the end is still governeed by sensible rights. Nor, I must admitt, is there much sense in beleiving that this dismissal of bodies would have a variation of such abscnence. You might say that somethings are more abscent than others, but at this point the definition is off. At least, I cannot speak to what is there, besides pure nothing that is, that is not from and to the world at hand. And as it is gone, so am I unclear how it is only partially so. Though, I feel like its remnants are not what were discussing, but rather a varied mixture of nothing -following that dissmissal. Yet in that I don't see how nothing is not common, pervasive and entire. Nor would it have bounds and configuration similar to matter. 
   <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, I make my claim that the elements of nature go only where she goes; and less we are reborn into her, and assuming that our stance on an aferlife is one where there is an unatural element -which we call soul or mind- which carries on, so is it my fair that such succession is not into a place which holds its own existence. At least, so much as we are gone from the place which hled the body were were alive in, so are the effects of those properties not present in a place which is bare of such suiters. And in a word, total is what I see when we are gone, for there is no clear persistence that our mind latches onto; nor is it present within anything but itself, and the effects which our embodiement held, holds no more. Even if there were forces and objects for pleasure and pain, where doth my tongue and groin, or by liable heart and hands?
   <br>&emsp;And perhaps, in summary, my depiction is one which merely claims that when we are no where, so is there not, of which we are included. By which would could cement our place now, as one which is equal to the objects which our end seperates us from. Which is to say that I, am no different than my hand, only the voice and intention which marks his portrayal, as one who is but the same as what he sees; whereby the end of him counts both the body and 'we': and truly begins the reign of not.
</div>
<div id="waveofliving">
   I would describe my life along two lines; but really, all is one, and as rough as it becomes, so do we take additional angles; as if we are trying to mend those knotted strands. 
   <br>&emsp;In that, I see that their is a pervasive condition, and one which breathes its success when their is an evident rest. For it is sound in that our ignornace of the continuation of tasks, would not yeild us any rest if we acted as though this weren't true; which at any rate helms itself under the notion that less we clearly removed from such ends, so would our awareness of such only procurr peace if we were congeninal to what we truly expected. 
   <br>&emsp;By that we are in fact sound, at least we have our inner merrits to level out any mishaps and ruts in the mainline. Yet, the world was not always this way, and our complexity of that line does not hold up to its low density. In that, we have attoned to much against its shortcomings, that all but its core thread are solid. Though, our time of remission has dealt us an unwinding effect, whereby unneccessary braces were loosened, and our core line was given rooom to breathe. In that, I see that so long as that thread is sure, are we well. And one way of judging that is if we are really fine being ourselves; whereby we'd be otherwise, if in our abscnece from people and things, we needed further aims or pleasure to make us content. Our past actions and expected ones should be enough to settle us now. 
   <br>&emsp;Weirdly though, there is this trekking flair to our stability, whereby the wave of live, albeit amended too, is one that continues. And in that, occupation holds our regard; for even though we have real harmony, it is moreso for stability and rest; which itself, can feel idling; at least as we have accompanied ourself to these ways, and our previoulsy pre-occupided self struggles to be merely so. I only mean then, that although their are prevailing forces from our prior time, so is their something to be said about making use of your time; at least, measuring and amending on the basis of what comes to you, and draws your aim, from the steadiness of these grounds. While before our ends were born out of a knotted core; and our place was one which tried to grow higher as to make our life even. Yet this was poor, and had not natural gait, or flow that is; but so in this current state when our nature is more suitably content, so are we unoccupied. Or better said, we can see positiviely that occupation is viable. At least, things in and of themselves; as if we truly were free. 
   <br>&emsp;I see the bulk of work that we have. And my wish is to find more meaning in it, as to reflect the words at hand. This covers our overall view of history and its general cover of life (civilly that is); the plainess of death and uncommon hue of gratuity; the insensibility of inconstance and non-totality; the portrait of sums, and its final reasoning; and, our colorfull resolve and core amends, which in other words remark our rest and liberty: which itself sprouts a mark for means and ends. I can only speak briefly as to what this means specifically, but in terms of what I want to do, I wish to learn how to write emails and (cover and or submission) letters, and bend our will towards publishers, of either a whole form or that of essay. Perhaps this campaign will include message boards, easier submissions and all things alike; and at any rate, our completed form is prime for family and friends to see -as a point of energy at least. Additionally, our fragments has a similar view, though its base is placed in the realm of content. This respects my large interest in the topics at hand, and allows me to be precice and prolific. I'd say this is relevant to our writing, but such a stretch has others before it; nor do I see much need to concern the benefits of such (then) exposure when the means to sharing are approachable now. If we try at least we can further manage and arrange what we have, as to find spots where it is accessible. Right now though, I know clearly what I have, and am not privy to any discretion which would see it excluded. "To all bends we can try."
   <br>&emsp;I'll try to go over our leisure more briefly. Watching series seems a garnish, for they are generally rich in detail and quality, and otherwise dense and short. Yet, in that, there are many, and through the spots of our week theres room for one then the other. House and Lost are no love of mine; but are at any rate pleasant past times. And although There Will Be Blood is important, so is it a series of its own, but unique of the sort. Film comes and goes, and shows need a break; while series are like books, which start elegantly as they end, and move on to the next with ease. True Detective is ripe, as Scenes has been. Maturity, from violence especially, can mark something as such, in that Peaky Blinders or Narcos may be long, or Thrones even, but so are they of similar natures to series, that it is fine to oblige. Otherwise, the show with Laurie and Hiddleston, Chernobyl, Mare of Eastown, things of life, plain, common, no matter the thrill and grime; not all will be absent of lust as There Will Be Blood; and HBO, Prime, Netflix even, theres plenty. And like a book, you just pick it up.
   <br>&emsp;I've got two things, but I'll mention Diablo first. This game is like Ark, BF and Civ, in that you return to it; merriting thus an understanding, as you are in fact playing a game: the progression of which should be known. It would help for old and new characters, if you knew what strongholds and dungeons should be completed; and otherwise which glyphs were worthwhile, their stretch of experience required, and what points of development offered what -such as Duriel around tier 70. Just outlining the minor bit between 55 and 60, where the endgame can than be approached, would make the slower pace of that acceptable. "And the stale parts, or stretches of growth required, through the 30s and 60s, fairs similarly."
   <br>&emsp;Secondly, and most dear when it comes to our point of occupation, is grabbing the civil lens of the world with integrity. It is so easy to watch the news and have your complexion of the world change; or watch a drama, or serious show at that, and find your colors dripping with red. I would say that most of this comes from concentrated impressions, which saturate a rather small pallete, with faint colors itself. Our extent of knowledge is not the problem, albeit unfilled in some areas. But rather our prominence. For even with our mere notion of populous government and the liberty it provides, that frame holds little prominence. Now, each part of the frame has its own mean, but so is there folds of tissue which fill in the majority of space in between. You can add more ideas as to make the complex more secure, but adding that volume will make things stand on its own; and otherwise make the structure there ballon and thrive. In that, foremost, is the account of the world. For general sense is what I seek regarding all of civility. Yet, in exactedness, to statitisce and numbers I trust. This means the population for one, then the incidences of crime, accidents, GDP and illness. And, to be fair, not much more is required. Perhaps different forms of systems, as in the bureaus of New York or the shires of England; all while each is a different flavor of neighbourhooods -which itself is a general notion, amongst others. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the key countries are in need of figures. That is, Canada, US, Britain, Germany, France (and maybe Spain and Italy too), Australia, China, Russia, India, and perhaps the larger souther countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria and South Africa. At the very least then, you can do overviews of the secondary continents - ie. Africa, South America and the Middle East. And at any rate, the history of these localles is worthwhile too know; for the population of modern Britain (and London at that) is better served by its progress through the centuries prior.

<div id="openended">
   I feel like when were talking about nature and death, we have to consider the alternative sides as if they were right. If we knew ours, or the natural one rather, was in fact so then our regard could be absent. But as it were, we know no truth of any sorts, and thus all ends have some merrit. At least we shouldn't speak about them as if their wrong, as we know not how in any explicit sense. Even if their proposal is full of contrariety and baseness, so ought we merely describe it as such, or at leas explain what those weakness' are. But the race is not over.
   <br>&emsp;Theres this notion of our main line, and how it in many ways gets crowded by the woes of other people and our own neglect; whereby passion and contrivance seek to bring us past this; yet in that Socratic sense, 'your soul catches up'. In that way, we are best to look at ourselves deeply; which is why we have such a interest in death. For totality is hard to regard, in whether it is consistent and whole. And at any rate, our stable time is one which appropriately wanders; as if it is not running around and ordained to things which are either false or contrary to that main line; whereby we are in fact settled and kept to that primary source, yet, in our progress towards this at least, we may have nothing else which naturally sprouts from this. In a way, our line of reproach has brought solid products with us back to this nearest ways. Which is to say, that we were in fact unsettled in who we were and thus pressing to some outward end; which admittedly held much constance over the years and accompanying merrit: yet that road never came to head, as we were routinely burnt out and with nowhere inwards to go. Now, as we have relinquished the falsity in what those outward ventures were for, we have more ease and accumulation to that deepest lane. And again, instead of hankering down as to find passion or relief, we are in fact personally stable; and from our excellent pace, we have brought back the goods from that, but to this nestled levels, whereby they more breezily float and drift.
   <br>&emsp;This idea of occupation then, is one where we have not but free time. Before, our aims were one that marked what we truly wanted, yet it was somewhat taken away and in some sense molded, for the sake and form of what would bring us out of our untendeed ways. Now, such eveness and strenght can hold itself from within; and as such, our interest which remain, or at least of faculty, have more room and reason to proceed and aspire for things in and of themselves. It wasn't the case that we were often drawn to things which strcitly fortold our relief; but so did those ultimate ways eventually lead such ends to become banked on so. Whereas now, the color of things has no pre-occupation, or motivation which is banked on something which comes from acquired strain. And in that, our occupation is one of election, purpose, meaning, substance, color and kind. Yet, being so forward about it has me thinking that our core solidity, is in fact of the bark, but not of any given plummage of fruits itself. We lack the money for occasions and thrill, nor is our character and time so far disposed and or familiar with friends and intiamcy. What we have is community, and the warmth and structure that offers. But at any rate, we are only able to easily be ourselves; as such harmony affords us to act without any strain. In that, where we are drawn is of a positivte sort, as our sparkle and delight is amended to by the graces of somethings complexion, as opposed to its reward. Yet, there is still less which I see when we are in fact idle. And that is so because our only gain, in repreiving to ourselves, is in being so worn out personally; yet not much else is there which settles our gaze, or clarifies it at least. Theres room for that admittedly, and some obvious spots for our attention. But just as our prior time was poorly measured on the basis of its truly struggling ways, so are we in this tenderly oriented state still uncontent without either the clarity or bend to something forward. This, to be clear, is not so that our position or heart can find a better station: as our actions right now have already garnered that. But in that even, there is a slowness, which, to positively, opens us to contriving something to do; at least to an end which is elected and drawn out, but liberally as opposed to passion. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the time of our communal self still needs more room and reason to find itself without much need to act. Whereby, we find occupation in this better self; which nicely compares to those weary occupations in our tired self. Yet activity is still what we seek; less overall, but still with many moment where the lack is still felt, albeit less pressing and tearing as to make me conrtive some amends (as our youth held) or move with haste (as our adolescnece has been). I guess my adult life is to small to ahve acquired anyhting which would make me happy; and in that I still wish to do; but still, we are adults, and a such can scult and mold interests and objectives that reflect the positive roots of me and nature. "And to that, I am with cheer in our end."
</div>
<div id="nowandcoming">
   It seems our amends are bent on two points: one being present, the other of ends. The first, regards intervention, which is to say that nature can be suspended, or interupted rather; and that as it were, in a cultural sense, our hopes and wishes (punishments to) can be delivered besides the normal course of things. This, to me, reeks of inconstance, and is thus full of contrariety. The simple figure to consider is a sphere, and how adding any point, be it on the edge or in the middle, would retain the uniformity of what it is. Now, if a sphere is in fact the mark of such uniformity, then a small bramble stikcing out would just account for the object being as so. "Of a specific form lets say." But, in the course of things, where motion from causes and for effects are concerned, so does that mena that the strands, which upon movement, nudge everything else, means that if one is introduced, so will everything be treated. "As I budge A a little, so does B move, which then moves C; and the point is that Z can't go without its own effect when the points its beckoned to are impacted themselves." 
   <br>&emsp;Now, so much is known about what the initial cause led too, that our lack of definition (and identity) there, means that that such cause is hard to describe. At least, we cannot say with natural explicity what it is or means. But, what we do know, or at least the fairest position to have, is that nature is not a inifinte mixture of indiviudal points, acting on their own accord -from whichever initial source. Instead, it seems that what caused one thing gave rise to the other, and like fabric twisting in the wind, there is but varied configurations: but all of the same whole. This means that there are not many domains, of which the intervention of one (and the accoording effects of all members in that) is not so exclusively. At least, we can say that from the light we see from the billions of galaxies around, so are we on the same level. "or spun from the same cloth that is." And again, all were trying to say is that a wick of fibre here accounts for the wicks of fibres elsewhere. Beyond the first cause, so has everything come up together, whereby all its motions were in fact respective to everything else around. This is why it is consistent. And there may in fact be many universe, or domains at least. But so far as were concerned, regarding ours, or at least 'a' universe, so is it all connected, in its beginnings and ends. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, theres very little evidence for the domain being impacted amidst its initial ways. At least, where one end went this way, tugging on others, and others did the same, so is the source of this the only real point of concern; but all flicks and bends that came from that, have all done so in unison. And as such, there is no evidence that intervention has ever occured. In fact, if we take this point of constance to be true, then we'd realize that as so much time of it has gone by, that the according stability could not invite even a sliver of instability, without the system going astray. "The smallest kink would spoil the immense intracy."
   <br>&emsp;Those are some thoughts about intervention; which indeed hamper anyone's interest or sight about benefits, and fears admittedly, in our active lives. At any rate though, I believe the chicken came first here. For death has always been the utmost concern, and by that, I feel as though nature's control over that has held our furthest regard. From there, I think the portrait of how such ends were dealt, progressed into ways in which our life could be altered too. In short, the latter marks that point of intervention, while the former measures judgement. It is worth mentioning that all could in fact be designed, and that what is good or bad may be set with you in mind. That is not the problem of intervention. The question of design, which is a deistic concept, is its own problem. What were talking about is the contrariety of nature, whereby introductions of things could occur without breaking the otherwise constance of things. And as it were, such constance in most ways forbids such intrusion. In other words, what was set, be it of mind and intent or some other wordly cause, is already in motion and staked: none of it can be changed. Wisdom would seem to be what drives the right amendment to such course; nor would our sentiment of faith be poor if it were angled on the appreciative side of things, regarding our place in such a merry stream. It is only when we get willfull ourselves, and earnest, and think that something new can be given; at least we fear for and wish otherwise, for ends which are in fact favorable; but with the ignorance that all things are set: or better yet, we mistake nature's constance for something which can be suspended. "Doth wisdom give us the claim of amending to what is, while the foolish sides of religion and theology have us wishing for such currents to change."
   <br>&emsp;Judgement is comparable in its folly, but perhaps even less so; at least, as I see it, the beliefs here are taken for granted regarding something truly baseless, that I see no trickery or silliness at play. Theres no real alternative, and as it were, this idea remarks the edges of what our natural view even knows. I deem prayer for change to be of more folly, as it stakes itself on things with more evidence to the contrary. Whereas death itself is less understood, that be of Cerebes and Styx, or the gates of heaven, I cannot say. In other words, the woes of ignorance are more active and unbecoming of someone, while the view of judgement is merely an alterntive -however weak- of an end, who even the ones with the strongest view don't know. "Which is to say that I don't scorn the complacency of a universal mystery." Still, I am not sure why judgement affords any credit. For it too compares to intervention, in that each are placed on supposed truths; generally regarding some divine govenor. And we know that at the very most, he set things in motion initially (and nothing more); and so why would our death be different. I think the issue is that we are assuming way too much what death is, and how it literally varies from hell to heaven; and that these are ideas that mark some notion of a dream; or at least an experience which has suitably positive or negative elements which reflect those of the real world, but lack the material itself. This is a casserole of inquiry if you ask me, and in most ways beckons under any wieght of due regard. To be clear, we nearly ardently believe that intervention is false, as it just sprouts to much contrariety; while death itself, albeit unknown, seems to hold an equal amount of discredit when it comes to comparably tradiotioanl ends. Only, in its case, the credit is not so clear elsewhere. Whereas the definition of nature is one which heavily leans towards constance, while our definitions of death some either mystical or absent. My point though, is that coming up with definitions seems fair, and disregarding the baseless elements of what is otherwise present seems fair.
   <br>&emsp;I think, in general, that our deaths are more comparable to a dreamless sleep; in that our body not being present removes any of the restless incorporations of our living experience. Whether the mind is seperate or of the body, it seems that there would truly be nothing, or something mental which was privy to nothing. "At least, our mind would be a witness to all things non-material. Which as a point of foolish remissions, reasons that the elements of the world would not be present, but in a figurative form." This is merely the description of death though, in terms of what it actually is. The notion of judgement is one where the end varies. Which itself is tricky, because that suggests there is seperate sorts of ends. 
   <br>&emsp;I think the problem is that what we experience as 'mind', has a progressivley smaller hold in terms of what is mind, and the body. If our heart flutters, that is nerves, and if we see, that is vision, nor is our speech, as a product that is, one of anything more than tissue and acoustics. The mind is internal. But even then, if our body is sick, then so do our thoughts feel similar, and our emtions at that. This raises the question though as to what is being effected; for the point to consider is whether the mind is of the body or not. Rather than being a product of organs and matter, which would then explain how our words and thinking are course and muddle when the instruments are mucked up, it still wouldn't make sense how the mind was tarnished itself if the body was all that was ill. The point is that the mind is inside the body, a witness. And how it experiences comfort and pain is one thing; but so is it not the victim in question. At least, how it suffers is not clearly understood; as the mind, being words and ideas, is not in this sense the scaffolding product from our bodies pedastool, but is instead something seperate, an agent of ether, who witness what the body goes through; to which our wish for death is banked on such seperation. 
   <br>&emsp;My point though, is that if the mind is seperate from the body, and we are not dilluded into confounding this notion -as it blurry vision being confused for something non material- then we are left with the bare identity of mind in general, and thus what constitutes its place in death. All I am wondering then, is besides the active expereince of the mind amidst the body, is how it could vary without the body. For in that, there would be no effects of a bodily sort; and what is  left over is not well defined. At any rate, it is unclear how the mind would not be simply left over, to itself, normal, univesal, divinely integrated. In that though, if there is something which is more than nothing, but not of material, it is odd to think that this would be varied, and not something, when compared to material, of a general sort. I lack of the minds active definition may be giving me too much an assumption, in that I am not clear how besides the body their is any expereince at all; or at least how besides the expereince of that body, that the mind has positive and negitive ends. That is the fair definition of heaven and hell, in that mental turmoil or glee would be your eternity; and as such, judgement would be fair to conlcude, on the basis that for some reason or the other, a side was selected. At this point though, I would say that we are left with a puzzle and no pieces. At least, the pieces that are there are based on the assumptions we have and poorly defined parts. In contrast, if the mind is in fact of the body, and ends with death, or at least holds no distinct sway once that seperation is done, and judgement is of no concern (or without prescence), then so would that seem preferable, in that all one was subject too was the endless void of nothingness: at least what was normal of entirety when material was absent. In that, I personally see peace, grace and tranquility. And while everyone else fiddles and jigs around foreign clues and schemes, I will simply procced with rest, liberally, gratefully, unchanged. "For in that blip of time, where all converged into a twisting itinery, of which mass, stars, planets and mind sprouted: so are the ends of that no puzzle to me."

   It seems that the world has come together; over time from wandering till the advent of men. Yet, in that, as groups formed from different points, so did the borders begin to push against all others. Much has been learned from this, in terms of civility, custom, laws, commerce: but nothing more pains the annals of people, then war. For in that communion, whereby our neighbours were of a different sort, so did we feel the need to prepare, secure, defend; which in its own right sprouted offenses. Yet, in that, I see much more than the simple tyrant, who took hold of what was otherwise a internal brace. Instead, I see the aims of man driving him to head. Broadly speaking, his lessons of yore and biblical sentiments, bend his claims towards that offensive. So that even if things were secure, which is fair as is governemtn acceptable for structuring things, so was religions affect one which drove people to aggression. At least, theres this antagonist response, as if the people beside us were somehow our opponents; which, they are in the grand scheme of things, as even a local competiont between two coblers is there. But in this case, it is as if the values we had of some divine purpose, rubbed up against the equally divine angle of those others. And my suscpicion, is that our warring natures is merely one that sees another as a threat; and rather than merely defend, we see too much risk in having them by our side. In this, I see religion as a limiting factor for our communion, as diplomacy and approval could not be fully had. Not only were the sentiments confrontational, but so was any real aggreement or amends hard to make, when the purpose of each party was so different. In fact, as Christianity spread throughout the medieval realm, the conflicts lost their grand scale. This holds thin truths mind you, yet my ignorance is about the relgion each member had. All I am thinking, for instance, is that if the Barbarians were undoubtedly christian, like the Romans, then I think that converse could more postiviely occur. I must admitt the details of this are sparese. The point though, is that as man has come together, forming nations, animated by God, so has the shifting of this (in each parts color and proclivity) settled us in our current place. For our governments are not subject to such foolish tyranny, nor are our actual problems ones which cant be fixed within our own borders. We're all similar you see, and the flattening of difference that religion professed, seems to have given us permission to deal with ourselve. Whihc, in aim, has us settling on the  effective qualities of our nation, and thus success of our people. At least, without the inflammatory truth of the divine sparking us to act in unfounded ways, we can at least be brazen in our givens; which is to say that the elements of poverty, illness, economy and education are acceptable by all naturally driven parties; and the organization of those, be it to a small group or massive one, is not subject to anything but the properties of the governenaces form. And my thesis, is that religion thwarted this natural understanding, and instead maligned our ingenuity and capacities towards conquest and tyranny. "As the unnatural roots of our commonality and souls, colored our solutions accordingly."
   <br>&emsp;So I may breathe some conclusion onto the page, I'd remark that beyond any notion of coming problems, the current state of most nations and their converse, is positive. In fact, when you consider the rate of poverty and acute illness' decrease, we can see that our place is a good one. And, against that fact of expecating future depravity, we can attest to the consistent rate improvement; and otherwise cite the reasons for such movements; which gives us the only task, of confirming whether the prescence of those means are solid and proceeding, or if their whithering away. By all common accounts, our compusre is more reminsicent of the former; and at any rate seems to be impropving. "For life in 1996 was better than 1913: but compare the quality of our lives then to our modern times in 2024" if I had compartively nothing, there'd still be the givens of technology in my hand, and all its leisure and benefits. Nor would the constants of liberality and services wain."
   <br>&emsp;But, strangely, I don't think the sight of the world remarks such quality, or the improvemnt from millenai prior. Likely, this is due to the media and tradition jumbling us up: but that is besides the point: regarding everyone else that is. For, be it the truth, I plainly see this; yet of others view otherwise, that I only note. Our own time and place then seems a mystery; for we are not at all subject to the open freedoms of such fine ways. Instead, as it were, we protect ourselves, in that the goods that come from these good times, are not commonly shared; nor are they so admired, or accepted even. In plain, we value things, feel ease or concern and at any rate angle our course, under the context of this world we see. And, developmentally, as I'd reflect, our greatest merrit and taste, is in the reservation to expereince what is commonlay good, for what is in fact truly normal. For as I remember, we have been hesitant to amend and be pleased with the norms of the common world. I always found it juvenile, promiscuous, faltering and or innacurate; and ny place then was to amend otherwise: or be obsinent. But, you see, that is our tale, our faith, or legend of man. For that detail is crucial, in that besides this veil of common ends, we were subject to it and all other things. This cross road marks our approach to freedom, in that as we matured we grew the trunk and bounds of a more becoming course -of the good world we see. Only, that commission and its appraoch, held its own ends of which our deliberate amends towards it, left us awkawrdly holding its riches. And that is both what I must change, and commend.

   The thing to understand, is that your view of things is fair. Only, the need of anything, however sound, is not equal to the actions it actually takes. For, stealing is in some way more comendable than indolence. Even though the act is a vice, so is it forward, and at the very least privy to rehabilitation and recompense. At any rate, those who live in virtue, have something to contrast themsvelves with; some adjacent shade that affirms their path, or strenghtens its place as the contrary beckons. But idleness seems a spares for all. At least, it seems to be born of an abscence of things; while vice is more of misguidance. "But at least their is effort, trying."
   <br>&emsp;I say this, because our efforts have not always been quite prominent, of bad or good. Instead, in our youth, we flattened out; whereby we set outsevles with very little intent to the common good; but were not elsewhere set.
   <br>&emsp;Now, the caviot is that the reason for our dismissal of norms, was sincere and galliant. But, the truth which we were more privy to, was not so much besides  the negation of norms; and thus, there was no alternative push for an end besides those norms: and we were thus idle.
   <br>&emsp;In this the path to real freedom was made; as per our virtue, we gave little to what those norms required; nor, beyond any neccessary aspect (of those norms) which we conceded to, did we loose our sight and mind for the primary truth. And so as responsability levelled our ways, so were we keen to use it for righthoues ways. At any rate, what was really demanded of me, as part of the norm, only extended to a certain point; and all steps past that were subject to the excess: where we were free.
   <br>&emsp;That is perhaps the reflected vector, whereby we denied the reign of duty that our youth was subject too. "Her threats were unsubstantial; at least, what she promised us if we met her hand, was not something that merrited risk of ignorance." Her ends admittedly held aspects of what is otherwise true, but so were these but general pits of a tree which those norms did not reflect.
   <br>&emsp;You see, the world is small, but round. In that, we are all together, but spread out. And in that, we prioritize the means to making our time and pleasantrie more favorable. Yet, in that, there is little to be said about what is either at risk upon our avoidance, worthwhile from further amends, nor any sentiment of liberal use; at least, if we were stable, what standard would deem us as so, and for what opened end. What is commonly provided, seems to bake itself in the excess of needs, fear of populations and governmence; and otherwise, holds no interest or integral strenght to be drawn or composed enough to liberty. Which, in our clear fairness, comes from the gluttnous complacency born of drawn out ends -for far neccesities- and the unexposure and repose to sound sources which rightyl portray the world; along with the whimsival saturation from tired and punget sources -ie. the news, drama, feeds.
</div>  
<div id="echoedflame">
   I guess my point, beyond what I can mold and define, is one of character and description. Simply, we are a man, but only because we are more privy too the truth. Yet, in this reflection, we can say that the part of history were subject too, is one where the embellishments of a negative world, are in fact unfounded; and at any rate obvious to  those with welcomed hearts: who shun and ignore those unneccessary demands. Which is to say that their are not enough problems for me to be as my heart knows, to sacrifice or repent over the amends to any apparent negativity. 
   <br>&emsp;The point, is that this is but a early sprout, or new one at least, that has come out of a millenia of fighting. As it were, the world settled following the dissmisal of Rome; and although their sat societies far in the east, the West grew with intracy. Yet, in that, its strenghts imploded the continent, as reason and faith collided, to be a hallmarked degree, but internall as well -whereby religious wars were done by those faithfull, but of different angles. In that, it seems that Europe has been the source of its own conflict. For reason and science has yeilded paramount harvests, in both pleasure and civility. Yet, the woes of conflict still ensue. Admittedly, the great turmoils were of a internal sort, with fragmented battles speckeld around. But so in the recent end of our age, did despotic rule take hold, leading to massive aggressions and repose. Why these were what they are is unclear; though Christianity and its contrast to natural ends -which would then be all agreed on- seems a partial culprit. For I don't know why Germany, Britain and France aren't clammering for eachothers throats; nor Italy, the Balkans or Spain. They all seem to be in harmony: and I am not sure why. It seems that the great wars were a turning point; but again, what evening force has brought them into harmony. For one, it seems the world has become more global in general, be it in laws, custom or trade. Telecomunnications seems the biggest factor then; only, the effect of this is whats essential. As I see it, the truth, or at least the strength of reasoning and evidence, is less liable to elitest hoarding; whereby everyone can know who is fibbing or not, and otherwise has more means to share such scrutiny. In practice, those in charge have no room for disguises, nor delusion: as information is so present along with the means for enacting unrest. This is a good thing though, as compliency of the government is good when its notice is bent on whether it truly performs well. It seems in our developed days, that the public is more incensed due to this form of accountability; but so are those educated able to see if problems are actually present (and their magnitudes). Its a strange thing admittedly, that the world could be fine, and refelct accordingly of those in charge; yet, the realm of discourse holds less relevant strands as paramount. Which, for those keen on knoweldge and such amends, really must content with the impressions and liabiity of stains, from the social bickering. It is hardly violent though. And with due respect to public scenarios where such ends were in fact so, we can suspend our own worries under the notion that, in contrast, our scenario is in fact successfull and pleasant: while those invovled in violent revolts generally had a reason. 
   <br>&emsp;"Who could pretend that those in despotic portions of the world weren't brave and cheered for in their opposition to such depsots; while what, we in Canada and the Western world are concerend with the effieciney's of our riches? What disregard is their for people worse off in general; but, compared to those truly severe incidences, does our call to action expose our ignroance in glaring ways: as if we are actually devoted to our personal cause: but of what suffering?"
   <br>&emsp;I think, as the story goes, that the world has been in general if not explicit conflict; and that this is generally due to the settling of major powers. And, at any rate, how the customs and resolve of religion, or the core values and culture that it reflects, satuturates and bends said nations. "For even if nature gave reason to judge our lands as green, so could our divine messages tell us that the grass was red, and that others were in fact too blame." This, running from bakers to kings, seems to paint what is both acceptable and sought by those who rule, and their subjects -who generally pressure the former when their needs and beliefs are not supported or secured. Nevertheless, past the wars which brought this turmoil and character to an end, we are clearly in a time where such norms and aims are uncommon. And in fact, the unfortuned parts of the world are rising closer to those who truly are; and they, with those at the bottom coming closer, are experiecing a reign of liberty, leisure, indsutry, service, peace, growth and natural fecundity, that even the older days of this are not short of their plehtora of riches. Yet, as pong has become Minecraft, so has our qualitiy of living equally improved. Across the board the elements may vary, and those who used to live in the mud may only be privy to Pac-man, so are we here in the average peaks of the world beneficiaries of Google, Wikipiedai, Youtube, the bounty of educational and work oppertunities from the internet, its bevy of accesible movies, games and shows, the evening of transit and cell phones, or any commerical product and service that is availabe at competative prices, and quick to your door. This is our world, and it is a mixture of what is now digital, and otherwise our use of this in the already free aspect of the world. As if we are now fortuned enough to use tools in our liberal ways, so has that given aspect of our citizenry found broader ends; as before, our freedoms were used to acquire what we needed, yet such means were themselves more arduous then any must experience now; nor, have those means been anything short of mitigated, as what we seek is more effieicntly bought and experieinced. "At least, the highest quyality of life is found primarily through devices, which come so cheap and cleanly, that the limit is only how much character and charm you have to use them. Maing the risk one of boredom, rather than stability."

   Theres just so much to say. The symptoms of our waivering heart, the absent mystery which suitably yeilds us rest, and the otherwise confusion about the nature of our amends, but how they came to be from nought, but to a world unknown. There's all these inneuendo's you see, as if those who are alive are doing so in ways that I can't see otherwise; as if old memories and infatuatoins are more reminiscent of truth, then not. This is so, for all we can do is deny, which itself causes stress; for the things in question are not clearly untrue. Rather, were rooted in something alternative, which admittedly sees those subjects as contrasts of truth; but so is our lack of touch to such way the impetus for us needing to address so. Whereby our grace with it, would see us with rest to all things contrary; and at the very least, disposed to be unprivy to such impressions.
   <br>&emsp;I guess our reflection is one that measures the worth of things, and how we in fact realized so amidst our youth and built up to it, rather than the common way. Yet, our deliberation feels more neccessary when our gait is slowed, be it to this truth or one other. And weirdly, our reflections tend to remove any fear of conseqeunce, as if our lack of action is a risky one. Instead, I seek more station within the right life, whereby our better moments secure us a clearer and secured approach. My reflection then comes, because our life has not treated us to such way; and in practice, it seems that our need for deliberation is a mark of having not made the right choices, or full ones at least. 
   <br>&emsp;Weirdly, our effortless graze is not one where everyone is removed and we are without sense or worry; instead, we feel more curious, as if the spacious sides of us are prime for development. Yet, time only affords us so much, as are the realities of this progress limiting. By that, we eventually reach a point where our effort is done, and besides wearing ourselves thin or binging as to cope with our state, with that were stuck with. 
   <br>&emsp;In that way, I have noticed that being with our current end, is one where we remain with the imperfections of it, and upon returing to an active pace we refine. This is why writing always happens on the front side of our return, or at least the beginning of the upside; as we are not so occupied with the effort to come, but we are also free and limber from our recuperation. Hereby, we are with not, in that our focus is unset; but we are well and able. Thus, the space around, or holes even, speak to me as they did before when we were recoverying; only now having done so, we address that.

   It seems that there are general truths, such as the organization which government provides and its subjects submitt themsleves for. Or, in particular cases of terms, civility may mean domestic affairs such as manners or knoweldge of the law, or in that, of knowledge or sense, of the basic idea of commerce, services and trades. 
   <br>&emsp;On the other hand lies facts, or things rather. Which is to say, that schemes and ideas are the atmosphere, while the actual trees on the gruond remark members of the registery. For instance, there is the general notion of monarchs compared to representavies, compared to the specific (and or factual) account of an actual government, say the federation of Nigerai, and its members. In a word, actual refers to things, items, elements or aspects of fact, which is to say evident and present to the world; while general is more akin to values, aims, truths, sentiments and ideas, which are likely born from actual things, but are not explicit things themselves. The notion of discourse follows, in that it too deals with real things, but uses ideas and figures as to form concepts and depictions which help us understand and explore those things: but they are not the things themslves. In a literal sense, subjects are those which we refer to as we practically epxerience them; meaing that if we were in the matrix, but saw red and blue, so would the truth of their constructs be irrelevant within the domain of subjects; while the fact of the matter, or real truth, would be as they are as entitites. Which, for instance, is explained nicely by the computing done to portray an image on the screen, yet the entitiy in question is not equal to the subject you see. 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, general truths remark our understanding, and besides the complexions of things as they reflect said truths, the elements whihc are general or more akin to subjects, and figures at that. While, the actual infant-mortality rate of Lagos is less a subject, but real in comparison to the general idea of infant-mortality. And, with respect to writing, one tends to think of the world along the lines of living and civility; with the strands of liberty, leisure and craft marking the former and commerce, governance and law marking the latter. Yet, for each, I am painting a general truth, in that I may say, that the world has improved significantly in a civil sense, as our rights and custom are much fairer and oppertune than they were a millenia ago. This is a general depction, as my reflection is but a figure on the wall. And, case in point, if I gave an example, or instance which reflected said truth, that would in fact be a mark of something specific, actual and true. "Which nicely shows the difference."

<div id="ofviewsandthings">
   It is perhaps the least welcomed but fairest claim to make, that reason is but the impression one gets of the world, and according means by which you amend. In that, all one can do is attest to what they see. In that even, there is the experience of others which is passed on; but be it of some tale or some evident complexion, so can we treat. "And, to be clear, reason is what takes these impressions and forms something whole: giving us a complete insight as to what something is, our need to respond and how." Reason paints the route in that sense.
   <br>&emsp;But for me, I cannot quite vouche for what I see. Contrariety is prominent when it comes to anecdotes and teaching; nor are systems and conjurings of artifical reasoning quite simple or comparable to the common expereince which we are best to address. Yet, in that basic realm, there seems to be not. In fact, theres not much but the world; and self regard is what orients me as to seek little from others -besides converse- nor is there much that one could take from me -besides arrogance (which is hard to dispute). There's not much for me, you see. And I hold little stock in narratives; as they paint the parties of the world as if they were sole entitties, but even if you did indeed split the government from the commonwealth, that even would hold its own intracicies, groupings and bends. We cannot speak to Germany or France but in a general sense; and we are only right to do so in an equally general way. Which is to say, that if we compound what were talking about, as in the batch of our sociteal lives into the notion of 'civility' or matters of that sort- so must we apply that notion within a general matters as well. For instance, it seems wrong to say that the Supreme Court ruled on this filing; as even it, as a specificed filing, is not so clear and precise. If you were in fact detailed, and gave the name of whose convicted, then the name of the judge would at least seem fitting. Again, I am not saying to not speak of the Supreme Court, as a general group. But the elements of it need more precision if the matter which it is being discussed within, is specific. I think, perhaps, my point is that we take concerns for particualr things, such as a war or conflict, but attiribute the members in question in general ways. Germany and France don't go to war, as neither are really but a lable for batch of other specific things. Poor on me to say, that this sentiment rests on the detailed concern of war, but then plotting the participants in a general sort. That is the issue; which itself, seems to raise little worries, or fair concerns, when the issue itself is quite general. General things then, seem best for overlaying ideas; which themselves hold not much more but depciting the scene of things, as opposed to speaking of them. It is the advantage of one talking personally though, as that general scene can extract particular elements, then apply them as is relevant to the one writing. Whereas, if you wish to convey concerns for the war between Britain and Spain, then you must specify the subject of war and its combatants. 
   <br>&emsp;I sit in this place then where the specific elements of our discussion hold no substance, in both the subjects and members. It seems everyone has but a general view of things, but then gets held up by specific instances; but fail to bring any comparable detail to the realm in which that member is being scrutinized in. "Its like a small grain of rice is subject to measurement, but our scale only holds 5lb incruments." On the other hand, their is this pernicious expertise, whereby the general mold of things is given little regard, and instead select rules and details are submitted; which itself betrays the mountain of other details that would seem important, or relevant at any rate, to the subject which they thinnly depict. These are your pundants and specialists; who, more than the average viewers, hold their positions through facts. Yet, I am fully unconvinced to what they say, for even though they can speak to something to specific, their breadht in that regard is quite bare. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, you must be accurate to the entitites in question. For Donald Trump is a grumpy old Biggot, but so is he a man like many; father, husband, buisnessman, citizne. And it is generally our characterues and irritability that has us view his actions and effects in a overly dramatic and ill-foudned way. In fact, if we bent our views only to facts, in a certain scenario that is, you'd relaize that beyond our emotions there is not that much that will readily change. Which itself garners no severity of concenr. "And we must be against our specific fears that amount only to what could change in the near hand, but then let this carry us away to make equally ardent but contrastingly poor fears for the future -in that our detailed attempt fails." I think that it is quite hard to be so; and that in our defense of the good, I concede only that there could be something bad going on: yet of what nature or end, no one has properly said. The moment, in which our fears are measured against, are to slow and in need of being exact, that no real assessment is made. In fact, the scales only ever tilt slightly, for adjustments can be made within any sort of minor end; that even if time holds us to negativie sorts, so will it have been by inches which we progressivley addressed. 
   <br>&emsp;The general notion then holds much finer regards. For in this, specific things are not to be derived, in that if the murder rate globally is five per 100,000, then it is not fair to highlight and berate our positivirty on the fact that some did in fact die; when in fact, the density of so is so small, that it is in fact those small specks overly saturating us that remakrs such a response, as opposed to approtialy refelcting the substance. And, at any rate, the dealings of things is never of a general sort, as each thing is itself an individual, and subject to others of the sort. Theres just too many single gusts of wind that can describe whether one will amount to what another did. It is just the nature of that particular breeze and the interatcion it individually had. It is not, to be clear, poor of us to be generaly; but, it is usually to get context and sense; or perhaps settle us away from fearing what the specifics are -as in low murder rates suggesting little concern for us to investigae. The point being, that generally there are positive truths; at least beyond general depictions, the overall results are significantly positive (across many metrics too). And, be it the sole negative, or of those present in any measured sort, so are these in need of particular identification. And, as it were, the thin attempt to do so is not a valid submission for reprisal or concern. "For nothing specific overhwlems other specifics; which in this case is largley postivie. Nor is it a solid measure less the specific is accurately stated itself."
   <br>&emsp;In that though, I do not know what I particularly see. For my goodness and state is not a reflection of some statistic, but the actual course and way of our lives. Yet, in that there is no clear object. At least I am not so clear on the world I see, and thus our role derived. I think, that theres a notion of pace, and how it is proper to be; in that, be it in war or civility, one ought not produce violence. This is a rule you see, a gauge for conduct, in that it claims what actions are poor, in that they are forbidden. This, is seperatae from purpose, or our role at least. This would be like one enrolled in the militarty, to which their post would be one as a solider. As history has shown, violence may be required against that principle notion of doing so. In this case though, the rules of our heart run against the needs of our profession. To say what is proper for each though, is not fully understood. At least, what constitues each is not clear. Nor, in my definitions, is it evident that our role can come from our customs. "As if being kind were either the position itself, or marker of where our position should be -as a scale for approval that is." This isn't entirely fair though; as the point of non-violence is not that one should not enroll within a task that requires them to do so. In some sense, that task is out of our control; and in that our rule causes us to be defiant. Yet, who is wrong here, for this instance suggests their is some governing authority who you are defiant of. Are they correct? For it may be true that violence is no anwser and should be forbidden; but it is not itself a role to complete, rather a rule. In a way, what were asking is, if what we are tasked to do runs contrary to what we think our principle is, which should we obey. Yet, in that, I am wondering how both could be correct, in that we were in fact tasked with being violent, yet our principle said otherwise. It seems, that ultimately one is not likely true; as people's confusion may in fact be what were disobediant too; or perhaps their right and we are mistaken in our custom. 
   <br>&emsp;This is the hardest thing then; as all roads lead to this question: What ought we do. But this is not given by what we presume to be present; as if being non-violent is innate, and our discretion of purpose should lay itself upon that. I'd say the customs we follow should be born of the same discovery. In a similar fashion, if our goal was to build a rocket to the moon, then the dexterity and engignerring required would reflect our neccessary acquistion. "As if the skill were the requirmnet." So would communcation be privy though, as would gluttony run contrary to getting it done. Violence would seem to follow as something unneccessary; but do you see how it is from the goal by which our custom is drawn. In an old sense, people were led to believe that God was killed by the Jews, and that for reconcilliation -as to reach their own goals- pograms were required. In that, violence was appropraite, as it was custom for the completion of their task. By that, I think the only important thing is about that task. Which, upon agreement, can consider the place for elements so far convened. "As if, one did indeed think violence was appropriate for their ends; but in seeing their path was wrong, and a new one right, we could consider then how such an element of the other path was fitting for this new one. And, the fairest bit of truth, is that what is past, present or to come, will, but recalibration, repentance or continuation, abide and adjust by the soundest edge of approval: which itself, seems the most important to accept: but in that, welcome the surest means to acquiring it, as to acquire a truth which was not merely our own subject, but false against all things, but was rather full and rounded to such things and all of entirety." Our God then, or the one who's will we make a constant, is that entirety itesld. "WHich, is then what we must understand." Yet, as far as I am aware, the hardest task of reproach comes to further: as beyond subjects -which our whims are all to eager to meet- the actual forray into the realm of entitites, is not identified or described. "Which is to say, that our limit in this sliver of modernity -past the age of antiquity- one where of true things, we are without a clear figure or label: and thus our judgement and according amends, are past the point in which were currently privy." Yet, in that, if we see our final goal, makes the current step worth surredning to, and accpeting its demand. 
   <br>&emsp;Which is to first identify all things in their entirety.
</div>
<div id="foractionssake">
   It seems, in brief, that our life is moving in a forwar direction. Whether this is to far off lands and with surrounding praise, I am with more doubt than not. But that we could soldify an auro of comfort, security and worth, that I am sure.
   <br>&emsp;It all comes down to those less then fair impressions, which ceaze us in our middling states and demand that we return to action for their sake. This is simply a hard thing to do; at least, as we remove ourselves from such complexions, so do their stains linger. Still, their prominence does fade, and going through the iterations of work and rest, you tend to define things -for a closing effect- that were suckling by your side.
   <br>&emsp;In that, I can say I am well, and moderatley so. Our aims and interests are not so heavily banked, as such ends feel poor and strained. While the seperation from that, has goverened me to be well in openess; to which our amends have been more communal and frequent. From this, there has been more consistency in those finer things I care about; as we are less pressed or idle in our restorative states.And, at any rate, be it these able means or the draw of these new sparkles, I am more confident and at peace with discovering and approaching things of fair want -ie. our writing, dating, careers and our life overall.
   <br>&emsp;It seems that our life is one which needs support; and by that, there is not much which can't be tailored where your effort doesn't lie. It seems that our need for some place different -beyond near term expectations- is based on somewhere far off drawing your anticipation; which itself, brings relief in that you have somewhere to go. Whereas, if we are idle, we tend to feel poor if there is nothing on the horizon. Yet, in that, we see that really all we need us cultivation. Be it of other committments, friends and relationships, work and purpose, and any liberal bends besides. This is not something which holds lingering wants or doubts; as the impetus for those is a lack of those formers. It is true that such disturbances can be mitigated; but so are we more privy to a constant state of acivity, in which the fuller roster of things is either discredited or ignored. This is a life of strain though, as you must eventually stop, revealling your discomfort or boredom; and at any rate, you tend to wear yourself thin as to avoid this; which leads to little constancy in those dearest actions.
   <br>&emsp;I think, admittedly, that their are shortcomings when it comes to our definitions. Even though there is a mountain of regard for them, so are their peaks no well formed. In that, it seems like assumptions of their place outside ourselves, or at least to some meaningfull end, are not prevalent. From this, we have loose if not figurative portryals of what those ends mean; which more often then not, bank on the perfection of our work, 'as to reflect the ultimate ends of such products'. In effect, our current openess has given us enough repraoch as to consider the more definite ways by which pleasure, purpose and success come to fruition. We are stable and able enough in our present state, as to withdraw from the far off imagery which till this point saturated our expectations. In this, the routes and paces required for such ends, are becoming more familiar and promising -at least their more clear as to their extent, and our place amongst such gradations. This, as mentioned, gives more direct and objective shades to the peaks of our inner delights; as their angles of fame, fortune and confidence, hold less imaginary sways but more clear sighted ends. This is quite pleasing, as we are more able to advance, all while humbly surrendering to the scope of the course were subject too. Meaning, that we know what is available for us to do; and we are present to an initial state, but also not so thin in our view of what comes further. In that, we can at least stand where we are knowing that our current claim is one sufficeint for what we want -or see as worth. "While there is no otherwise bound to our fantasies."
   <br>&emsp;In terms of our actual paces though, they are not so invovled in those coming ways. It is true that such paths are more revealing, and by virute of our admittence of their possibility, so are we more keen and willing to committ. But were tired, coming from a long period od wear. And a good sort of that, which continues still in these more moderate ways. But, the introduction of those promsing aspects is the reach of our stage; and be it the limits of our scenario, the need for more definement, or the pure priorities elsewhere or short-change of our eager regard, holds me from furthering in those matters. Again, the course is fine, and through the spring and summer there will be much where we can grow. And, at any rate, as I suspect by the fall the future post of our life will ahve settled, so will more subsinent gains be worked towards. But right now, we are still nourishing our liberal sorts. And even as moderate as we are, we are still subject to those dearest of ways. "Whereby the warmth and strucutre given, is for us to rest, feel free, seen and at peace, on our road to fecundity. As opposed to feeling freeo from active remission, and settling into a fairer pace which welcomes long term committments." 
   <br>&emsp;Here I'll end, which is on this note of energy. This is in reference to the purpose of our social affairs, and how their benefit is not so much in themselves, but in the relief and sustenance towards our creative ends. The thing, is that such ends bring their own priorities. On one hand, you have the principle which the best qualitiees favor. Yet, in this, I have no probelm, as wholesomeness has become my preferred flavor. Yet, this takes alot of the comforting sides of our sepeate committments; as the candor and shine which we'd have otherwise, in the prescence of others, being our true self, is not itself an object or beneficiary. Which in a practical sense may be the case in general. But, if we were more pronounced, or at least at peace in our place being merely there, then so could we see it as the point of cultivation. But its not, its seperate, good mind you, but adjacent to our creative intent. And this is fine, nor do its benefits come with much cost. Only, we are subject to our own life in this creative place. For, practically, there is not much to get in pleasure, purpose or fame regarding these recreational matters. Our excitment can be there though, at least from the possibility of being present to others; along with the suggestions and inquiry to toher matters that this experience brings. In that, being withotu such a flair removes what we could dream about or expect. At least, the more accpebtlae point of these committments finding a more secure and developing place amidst a future home, is one that sees the distance from such point a troubling notion. 
   <br>&emsp;What this all comes down to, is that it is hard to be magnificent during Yoga, Church and other curisoities, when in fact there is not much to expect beyond what our average stature would bring; nor is the upright edge of such candor one which rests outside of immediacy. Which, again, is fine, but this makes our whole life overwhelming. As our pursuits of creativty are long; and admittedly their point of interest, purpose and pleasure, is not one where we need do anything than enjoy and continue. But such a hearty yet tender bend, stifferns and draws reservation at the thought of being prestine in our outward committments. Which again, holds little in terms of what you get for showing up; for even if there is seomthing more to get -in that pleasure, fortune or prupose- so does this take much time.Which is to say, that no moment of excellence will procurr much; at least when compared to your general goodness and heart, showing up regularly. Perhaps, as the pleasure of our live surrounds the heartier elements of creativity and self regard, that the pleasure of being present to other people in our greatest way, is something we desired. For it truly does unveil more possibility, nearby or far off. Yet, this seems to be something worth avoiding; or at least in our discretion, is the wonder of these common things worth being pleased about when the demands to experience so are so large; which, weighing against our creativity, seems not worth it. At least, if our life can have its strucuture, soften through consistency, and otherwise treat us in being our dearest selves, amongst the world as we have, then that seems wortwhile and fair. 
   <br>&emsp;Practically then, our experience with Yoga makes me want to become fit, in both strenght and our own stability. This goes against our current state though; and having been to Yoga several times, I can see that our expansion there is in need of our own personal training. In that, I would attend where you can, but keep to reformative training; shouldering your efforts with pulling and lunges, while doing pushups and aerobics to bring your vitality out. Musical flow can surround this, all while twisting and restoring. "Our own private economy is in need of substance and itinerary, before our place in the market is secure. You may go though, but with the prioirity of whats done at home in mind." Shambala, amongst our other attended efforts, is the nicest and simplest. We show up at 730, usually keep ourselves off camera while everyone is in silence; then join for the contemplation and discussion after. Truly, theres peace in this; and so much as we can afford, we can align ourselves in our prferred ways. Besides this is TSU, which is short, familiar, and otherwise easy to come as you please. I have become known as a writer, but so is this for me to disocer what is good, rather than extract some strict benefit -from these people. As it were, we have converesed enough about it, and our prescence is not so prevalent in that respect; their not giving you anything but attnetion, but so is that for you to bring to actual light. Compassion on the other hand, albeit brief and with means to be seperate, is not terribly interesting, and is quite busy in my experience. Also, it comes between Shambala and Church, so it ends up being a morning duty, with not but the common company and its pleasure. Which is nice, but isn't a commitment. Which is what I see TSU as; though, it being so familair and civil, is one where benefit and converse can be had. But with no stakes to be there or not -and at any rate return.

<div id="astakefornot">
   When I reflect on our biggest discontent, it is the lack of purpose that I feel, or when I do at least. This is so, compartiviely for instance, when I picutre someone else being called to action, to give a speech, to travel for for some purpose. Our actions tend not to feel so important; or at least, when they do, it becuase of the merrit in our stead; but so does this seldom materialize, or find any relevant traction. And otherwise, breeds this need of perfection.
   <br>&emsp;What I suspect is at the core of this, is that there are problems to solve; or improvments to make at least. And at any rate, there seems to be a poor, if not unbecoming approach to doing so. In that, I feel drawn, as if our call to action is one of bringing the truth we see. Even then, I can see how this is a aprameter for all; as having the solution, or means of progress, seems crucial for any in its possession. What I am thinking though, is that the truth we see is but a suscipion under a curious lens. While the prgornosis on display is more set within the competion and ad hominens; as if the anwser is knonw, but those running the gambit are misaligned. Whereas, in me, I see the truth unidentified or describe; whereby our reproach to such limit, is one of curisoiites. In that, my desire to move forth and share, is a reflection of that. And thus, it is not so much that what we suspect or feel is in dire need, but rather we just want to be open; at least, in or tender ways, we are less afraid to make the fair and common attempt to do so. For at least, over time reception will grow, but so will we feel preserved in our un-averse approach. "Where we would otherwise yeild to embelisshed wishes or concerns; stiffening us to not approach." 
   <br>&emsp;I'd say, formally, that leisure, inudsry and care mark the inner warmth of ourselves, while pleasure, purpose and success are outward sources of heat. It seems in the former case, that as our priorities station us, so will the exvess of that (which we call liberty) breathe in our reflections and delibertaions (as to align and decide what we'd do with such excess); with the elements of leisure, or play, industry, or craft, and care, of nature and things, as the embers of such flame. While, those outwar ventures seem like products of equally outward efforts; in acquistion lets say. Only, a question arrives, in that the stability of our core fortunes affords us an excess to be spent on those liberal ends; is there worth in taking some of that excess and applying it to more fortune? I would say the anwser rests on the notion of slack, whereby the peaks of those liberal ends need no perfection or stiffness to remain; and in that, the room they have to wander and slide, while remaining upright, is where you have liberty to horizontally grow. In that, as you extend, so do the princples and fuel that make those liberties (of play) rise, do so with equal color and lushness, but amidst a broader space. This is in concern of adding more prioirities in that outward sense, and that  even if our leisurley efforts are still upright withotu being stiff, that the force of the former will cause us to be crowder, or squished. This is indeed so when those liberties are risen with strain, and placing further effort to fortune stiffens the whole lot. Yet, if we let our the ripness and trunk of our riches settle with merriness, then the remaining excess can afford an expansion of the ground where they stand; as to make these additionall efforts not confining, as their products bring more width. 
   <br>&emsp;I think, that our fear of posting, practic eand submission is one of reputation; in that we know, or find at least, poorly place efforts as unpromsiing. It is not so much what  we need from this efforts and how those stakes make us fear failure. Instead, we are unsettled by our own poor efforts, and their restriction from us having even the small amount of desired success. For that is the point I think, that our greatness needs know audience or bounds, but slight converse and potential. Our actual forward motions can be drawn out later; or at least be pursued with a weifht that respects such purspoe. And, to reiterate, there is not this problem waiting for us to solve. As, even our mightiest anwser, will be submitted throughout the strands of things. Which, to be fair, accounts for someone being their greatest self, in that what they have to share is made best and thrown out; but so is the impact one that can only hope to be as much as it can; at least to remark our right step. 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, I can see the impetus for this all, in that we are not so constant in our compisure towards such paces. But this is also, on the large scale, subject to our developmental appraoch, whereby the near term is subject to habitiual impuiritues. And otherwise, the course of our life tends to even out under the lines of where it is going; withotu any recompense for where it is not yet. And, truth be told, it is hard, when you don't know exactly where that is; so that you are in fact not so privy to where your going. Our sense though of the world, and that where there are conditions that peoples and governments are ordained to this in their own localles. And generally, it is the complex of each one that is repsonsabile for their own conditions. We simply aren't there where we could make a big enough splash, as to change the world over there. But weidly, where my might could in fact impact, is not one where I am afraid to aviod. In a way, I see the world I am part of as one which could benefit in further positivity; whereas the real problems across the world as a whole, are ones or removing negativity. 
   <br>&emsp;In that though, I can see that what is really important to me, is in furthering our definitions which reflect a progrnastic turth for those remedies. While, the excess of joy that I see, is not bound for some purpose itself amongst our rich mediocrities. Only, in that, there is more room for a slack approach, whereby the brevity of sharing your positivity, is equal to the standard by which your sharing is judged. Which is to say, that it is really more for me, yet by that the standard is your own happiness. "Which, in my delight, is found quite simply." But whereas the approach to the world's remedies is a serious one, which judges me courselg in both our manners and product -to which their is a long journey- so are my introductions of color and joy, for those lacking problems around me, not something with any comparable severiyy, but something of possibility, our own pleasures, and community perhaps. But this has no consequrniaal edge; as if our compalcency throughout life woudl bar us from uncovering truths which actually impacted negativiy. In that, our writing, study, platforming and charm, is from me in what I give, and for me in what I recieve. "Which, in substance, means that we share in eachother's postivity, in that we receive eachother's excess's. But fear not that you would already be fine, and without subject to their own surpluss, while you were contendedly idle."
   <br>&emsp;In closing, this notion is a fine one, which we will merely describe. Simply, I look at my new local efforts, in yoga, zoom and churhc, and I think, that in regard to pleasure and comfort, their accesisble. But not for much more admittedly. Theres no stakes, merely something for you to otherwise attend to. Then, I look at our liberal efforts, and their present extent; and I think that for the most part, it is personally well. But, when I look at severity of those, all while being liberal, I see how there are but undefined sections that in fact reflect such common and personal times, but free and open to outward desires. This, in effect, means that there are places for us to be as we please, with the complexion of these liberal elements. In contrast, our serious venture of identifying all things, seems to be within the outward realm of things, whereby we really apply. This is different then our personal interest in writing finding a place with more energy and strucutre beyond ourselves. This is comparable to our Yoga, in that it is a place I want to go; but is for me, and beckons me not to either make something grand of it, or be great myself, as if we suppose to lead. We just go there. And while our civil ends have opened up in this respect, so ought our liberal ones; whereby we join classes, go to meet and greets, find platofmrs and forums to put our ideas, or whims at that. But easily, plainly; so much as vibes and fit spark your desire, that you would unapolegtically and for your interest sake, do so. Generally, we avoid this, as it tugs on our bareness of real purpose. Yet, that has been settled on finer things taking their too develop; in that we'd best express, rather than finally show up to be the final anwser. "Theres already so much going on; and your impacts are for far off places, which are already subject to their own liberties and organization." At any rate, as this has become settled, then so is our own happiness a free concern. And one, with its own promise, and perhaps ability to further those deeper matters; but not one which needs anything more than what it meens to pleasingly be yourself. By that, our trunk and core are essential; yet, in being so privy to that but not so worn or negagted as to lean on those true purposes so much, we can more casually and to our delight proceed in the civil realm. Whereby we submitt our writing not to change lives, but to solidify our own. "Which, the attempt is nearly enough."
</div>
<div id="beyondshivering">
   Lets be candid for once and ont describe the rules of things. It is winter, and that means the shivers of the land are common. Still, man's limit of resourcefullness is hardly tested here; at least, someone else has provided a solution which the rest of us can benefit from: being clothes. Still, it is not always comfortable, in an elegant sense, to be outside. In any case, one could compare the summer to this, in that it has its own shortcomings of comfort. On the positive side though, they generally share too. As, per the ease in which one can go outside, there is the question of what they'll see. In that, the warmer month's have fine mornings and peacefull evenings; while the winter periods have nice mid-days. At any rate though, the weather can ruin such party; be it of fog, overcast and streaks of hazed condensation, so can the scenery which our comfort delights, be covered. The point though, is that beyond their actual shades, the presence of good otherwise is nearly equal, and otherwise comparable in the weather their subject too. To be fair, the warmer months have less intrusive properties, as the colder months can have longer bouts of overcast. But still, for a barren tundra, the consistency of good is still present, however irregular.
   <br>&emsp;As it stands, the current comforts are somewhat mild, as a breezy chill has come over the hills and muddled the previous coolnees -into an actual chill. But, this seems but an odd occurence, as the time for warmth is reaching a return; or at any rate, the harshest moments are far behind us; while those considered less preferable, are nearly past our side. 
   <br>&emsp;My active time then is gaining a slight rise, in that we have more room and reason to go out, be it of leisurely or fitness sake. And, since the advent of electric scooters, so are we more eligble to wander and explore. At least, in the earlier days of the freezing cold, so were those ventures fine then. "And not even a puffy cloud was presnet; or leniancy of wearing anything short of several layers: think of the summer and spring! And our fearless return -marking true progress, as we have no need to reset (via a burdened pause)."
   <br>&emsp;Besides that, everything is circumstantial. For it could have been that we were sentenced to death 3 weeks from now, and that such present could be as it is (in the winter) or the heat of summer. In that sense, our disperions of excellence and perfection comes at a unique time. For one, the actual means to getting around, luckily, is  made so by our access to a car; yet, in this for me personally, there is some bagge: though the heart of our intentions gives leave for it. I only mean, that besides the acceptable amount of negativity, that the cold and timing of getting our scooter, means that the ease and excitement of actually attending these commitemetns is less; in that, if we were going to Yoga at night, we could scooter somewhere before and watch the sunset. Which, we could admittedly do while driving; but so does that means of transport drench such interest, or at least muddy my sight of it. On that note too, is our actual place of living. As being in Kamloops affords no clear roads or short connections; while our foresight of Vancouver seems to offer such refinements. "And all the spots of wonder and peace that surround that -be it on route, back home, or for ease."
   <br>&emsp;I can see the spring coming. And, as fact, we will not be able to go on the course to any good extent. Having a scooter is a strange thing; at least as our neighborhood is plopped up on the flat top of a hill, so are we kept from the fields below. So, by circumstance, we are privy to the nearby routes. Though, I can't ignore the fact that we have had a scooter, used it, enjoyed it, and learned how it can be usefully and happily incorporated. And likely, this will be acquired by the time that the our home changes. By that, we can access the edge of the greens near the bottom of the hill. Or, we can go to spots near the eastern edge, or closer to the further eastern top. At any rate, there are small nooks for us to sit; which, to  be fair in their negativity, limits us in quickly reaching a nice place to read. But a brief walk is not outside our bounds. And, at any rate, hower well or not that constant is, so are we able to go for drives; be it for that, or to stop and see. Moreover, we can go down to the fields and go east, up the yellowknife into Valleyview, or west in downtown; or we can stay to fields right beneath us, and sit somewhere quite while we read and see the moutains around. Even then, we can go a bit further to the land surrounding the industrial zone. And, if were feelin lucky, we can go to North Kamloops -from either of the bridges to the other. I can see, as it gets warm, when the suns sets further north, and theres clouds more commonly in the sky, that we can go to these further extents, in the afternoon or evenings perhaps, and generally be remitted from our otherwise homely dormance. Also, on two quick notes, is that as the morning and nights become at least cool, so will rides be accesible then -for treats in one and sunrises in the other. Secondly, is that in Kamloops it does not rain; and so this awkard need to store your scooter inside is unneccssary; as our confidence in the right lock blows any concern of security; and as for its health, so are the elements nearly always tame. It is true that when your in a place that has more variety, that some arrangement will need to be made, or concession at least -to use other means of travel when the elements are poor. Or, as I see some merrit, is in scouting nearby spots that are covered; and then relying on the security of your locks. "For in any case, it is not how far you go that makes a scooter safe; but rather the lock, and the openess of where it is locked. And whether you leave the perfect spot to walk 10 mintues away, is moslty besides the point, as time is the only other factor. But still, during the day especially, and in particualr when there are eyes about, the exposed nature of it keeps it from being laciviously seen -and the lock is reassuring at any rate."

   So we muight simpligy things like this. There is your God given role, in that you have a body and it must do what that body does. Breathe, eat, sleep, secure. And, as it were, our initiall ooh oohs and aaw aaws were not much more than that of a monkey, or other animals of the sort. But, due to certain properties, we grew more success in our enviornemnt; by the advent of tools we'll say. And, akin to that civil notion of agricultures stability affording developments into the civil realm, so would it make sense that our icnrease security gave rise to increased identification of things. In a primal sense that seems fair. Then, as the modern world came to be, so was there writing, or representaions at least. In that, the measures of discourse were employed, whereby we'd speak of subjects through the tools of explanation and consideratin. This, compares to perhpas our primal sophistication, where our intial expansion of the memebrs we could point to, held no complex regard with how we dealt them. And, as I see it, our current sense of why were so intellengince, is really a remark of us truly being so; only, in that, I only see that we have learned how to make transitions and descriptiors in our statements. "As if we have learned how to speak about things in finer ways, beyond the actual ability to mention things at all."
   <br>&emsp;The point, is that our ability to speech and its station having developed out of our primitive capactities into one which reflects this world of inquiry and craft, is but a developed configuration of our otherwise normal body. By that, we may have these properties to us which grant civil freedom, and otherwise employs remarkable ingenuity and craft; but as tools and lens of the body, which then means that such mental faculties are balanced ontop of the needs of the lower faculties below. Of a muscular, respiratory, digestive and immune kind. "Which in fact is how our mind can function, as its parts use more of what those other bring in."
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, we are all within a condition. Which, is not for the sake of argument gravity, but the practical relations of our bodies requirments and the enivronemtns withdrawrawl from us acquiring so. Yet, in that we have means to try; and as it were, Man has come above those muddy grounds and built roads,and vehicles at that. Still, he must maintain those roads; and otherwise keep himself approrpaitley placed as not to get distracted at other producs of our proficient times. At least, those marginal elements of luxury, substance and gratuity, have no place within our condition; which, in its right, marks our need for food, security (of country) and a bed. 
   <br>&emsp;If we have that then we are proportionately fine. Yet, a problem has arisen though in recent times; whereby the success of these marks doesn't lead to a life which is enjoyable. At least, it seems that the means to these few aspects is not a troubled proposal for some people; and with all the extra freedom available, they make eithe poor choices, or none at all. And it is that latter point that has brought colors (of grey) to the sentiment of nihilsm, anaarchy, determism and overall existence. And to be clear, not everyone who has a a roof and bread is so pessimistic; but I would say that most people outside this slice of folk who are so begrievd, live commonly besides this in ways that are either full of other responsability, or promiscuous and gluttunous. 
   <br>&emsp;In a sense, each member reaches an excess, whereby their needs are met and the surplus effort is spent on something more; be it increased benefits to our life, the pleasures of the world, some more purpsoefull, or otherwise a middling indolence that begins to coarsen as it breathes, as too much time is spent withdrawn. 
   <br>&emsp;I think beyond the nature of man and what he needs, and at least the insights of how things truly are and how our entire species should be, is this personal problem of excess. As, it indeed leads to discovery, advancement, uprisings and change. But the consistency is quite broken; as besides those riled up enough to rebel, or those able to marshall themselves privately for the sake of curisoity, the common man is one merely employed, and bent to meeting those duties as suitably can; but, over time at least, when doing so, he comes to that point of excess. "Picture a 59 year old man, whos a welder for instance; who, with a family and home, has provided; and perhaps in his yougner years he did so pleasantly and with other enjoyuments around. Yet now, he simply goes to work then comes home; and whether he sinks into a bottle, or merely hunches back and watches tv, I suspect, or at least their is a sort of common figure of this, where theres some irritable, curmudging grump, who complains, feels bothered, and is otherwise in denial of anything wrong, for his post (I belive) is so inportant, that being kept to it has pushed all things out, yet fairly as such attendance is needed to do."
   <br>&emsp;And so, we must as a rule, address the consistent place of duty in our lives. For if were politicians then our perfmance will be continuall judged; or if were buisnesmen or merhcants, then we will also be under the scrutiny and approval of customers and market conditions. Equally, if we are farmers, then our tasks will keep as long as the sun rises; or if were scientists, then so will the lab remain, drawing our curisoity, but holding our committment. None of our needs will change: and thus their means.
   <br>&emsp;For instance though, there is this common motion, whereby our fortune gives us room to work for more; or at least, upon reaching a point where our lower fortunes come to stability, we then work to improve -or acquire more at least. For me, this is its own point of excess; as the additional qualities of life are but that, add ones, extras to those which we could not choose otherwise. In this though, I think the value of ceratin qualities hold more flavor then others. In short, the things of our lives beyond stability which are wortwhile, are those, on a basic level, which afford our flow of life a pace of consistency, substance and ease. Nothing we do should cause concurent negativies; and hangovers are a clear mark of that. Nor, should our efforts be bent on ends which are outweighed by the effort; and extravengece tends to reflect that. Or, on a similar note of the caliber of substence, it should be itself measures along these lines, in that the experience was not brief, hollow, brittle, expensive or vain; but rather, it should elevate you, lighthen, speak to the tenderness and might which you have to embelleish; and otherwise it ought be respectable, convienant, steady and pure. A volunteer earns such favor, in that they feel committed for meaningfull ways, nor do they have any impusle to hide -as if the acitvity were unbecoming. Nor does their engagment end with dessert or the dreams of tomorrow, but the generous paces of the day, usually through and through. A soldier, caked in bravery, ears his accolades comparably, in that it is his enrollment withni the post, regardless of where the efforts of that take him, which earns him the admireation of others, and at any rate the demand of strenght -but perhaps neccessarily so.
   <br>&emsp;In short, there ought be something positive, and abundantly to our excess efforts. If our natural condition is too be warm, then we only need so much; and if too much heat is given, then we actually get hot, which inflammes our need. And at any rate, if we consider our self stable, of being warm that is along with secure and fed, then the continuation of that will be accounted. Weirdly though, the constance of our working lives need regard our excess. For, if in a moment we are stable, but then go to the bar and fall drunk over, then our return to work tomrrow is achieved with less ease, or ability in some instances. In that sense, our excess efforts -that which our work affords- should not hinder that work. At least, if our stability is waining, or at least expected to decreese, then we cannot say that were solid.
   <br>&emsp;And that is the gauge mind you, in that beyond our working capacties, if we were then to judge it and the excess efforts of pleasure, purpose and further success, that our solidity was what marked whether we did things well. For even in those primitive times below, the sliver of surplus evidently gave rise to a free moment to look up at the stars. But even then, we can see how even those moments of real profit, winded themselves into something negative. And, at any rate, the roots of those mystical extensions of ourself, eventually wore out the required means to addres the natural core of ourselves. That is, when the governments of medieval europe were clerically bent, so were the priorities, anticiaptions and knoweldge of the realm unbanked against the possible threat of disease, whereby the urban realities of the time made such ends a certainty. "We let our primal times of superstion root itself over a millenia into the authorative realm, whereby the basic measures of hygene were not adminsitered well enough: and nearly half the continent died."
   <br>&emsp;What this means for me then, is that liberty, being the finest of those excess', holds no private bar for you to do so. There are problems of the world, and your natural curisoity may lead to mighty suggestions; but this path is long as it is great. And, considering where we are, we are still only at the point where suspciion turns into theory.
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, the point at hand then is when it comes to you, your time is all thats at hand. By that, you surely wan't your free time to be liberal, in that it was filled with moments  of leisure, industry and care. But so in this, can you feel drawn or delighted to some surrounding end; such as a bookclub, a meeting, a gathering of sorts. Doing so is really up for you, as it brings you otuside your personal matters and shines them in an open light.
   <br>&emsp;The problem, has always been that our liberal ends were to hunkered on their supposed purpose. And that because being outside ourselves can make things lighter, we choose such hidings. Now, I understand that our interest in writing can epxand, or mingle, where it finds delight; at least, with the pace of meagerness and peace you can try. And at any rate, it would seem that those perfected theories, are suceptible to everyone else by your prescence to others. Obivously the world around will not be privy to me already; but to other nodes of people, so will that come from our own node. And in that, we must balance the weariness and shame at not being so prognostic and great, with the more common unions of ourselves with friends. That is for me at least, and my ideas and their breadht are subject too that. And, for pracitcal and beneficiary reasons, along with your own constance and tranquillity, so is that better mark of you being in this opened ways, a converging benefit for your own time and those ideas. In fact, they seem to be one in the same; for as it were, their lineage is one out of spite and privation. Yet, without any common place or minglings, we held to far sights for what our ideas could achieve; or at any rate what would be required for them to grow. And this need not be so, for we are more ingraced to the commons; whereby we can see freely the time and pace that our grandeur needs. And otherwise, settle into our own merriment, and rest on the notion of the products which come from that: for in all mans problems, the support is already made: and when it comes to its postive end, so are we responsabilie for ourselves. "For that is what draws others out." And, in a way, it seems that our bounty of positoivrty will refine into according ideas: but are thus born from that continious stream of your merry self. So be

<div id="thepointofgood">
   Im not quite sure what I should do. On one end, there are problems, at least there are things which reflect our inadqeucies, as opposed to the natural ends of mortality. On this note, there is the protection of the products of those ineffeciences; yet, part of me thinks that the root source is the real concern. At least, it is strange to think that you would be well off yourself, and not see, or at least ocnsider such source.
   <br>&emsp;On that end you have the quandery of form and void, and its remark on the meaning of things and thus our lives. My position, is that all our worries come from the manglings of speech and its correlarlay with thought; and through our ill-wisdom too that and the ignorance of what these facotr are, our anticaptions and worries take on the realm of dreasm, whereby we poorly use the faculties which are in fact dismayed. By that, I see the nature of things, be it form over void, void being released into form, or some other singular union (of a asietic sort perhaps); which, as fire is kinetic and butter savory, so are our words and thinking euqally part of the domain. And again, all I see is that our words and ideas get jumbled when they are themselves questioned. Yet, in that, I see no history of struggle from those without regard. Rather, those who helm their words, or at least have enough thinking as to address all things including their thought; whereby the tyrants of innaccuracy and superstition reign over our head. "As if the things which our words reflect, are so too things which are not themselves refletable; yet, our mind has a tricky nature in this case, whereby its reality is not so privy to be free from seeing things in what they really are, and not being confused for what is otherwise fit for a dream."
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, this is our measure of truth. And by that, we see that there are prime factors which govern our society; the mending of which would bring less unjust products. And, to be clear, there is no shame, and in fact there is courage and high regard, for defening against the sparks of injustice. But so too are we subject to ourselves; which holds no passion for others, in turmoil or fortune. In that, we know that beyond people suffering more than even our worst is, that we still have our own responsabilities, of continuation too. 
   <br>&emsp;The trouble comes when those stabilities and their constancy create a profit, or excess; whereby we can deliberate and attest to things past those stabilitites. In this, the call to action is fair, in that one can surely afford to spend their time helping others if they are indeed well off themselves. But, the question then, is whether the duty of free men is to tamper the flames of societies uneveness, or to actual even it out. "Mend the negativity, or create positive change." 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, it pays to be aware of how things are, in both crime, civil services, commerce and disease. By that, you realize that your place cannot be in saving them all; as one's attempt to aid those with tuberculosis, settles them away from fighting crime. In this sense, the positive element is whereby one seeks a cure, as to curb any misfortunes. While, those who fight in wars, work in the field to treat illness and death, act as ointments and medicines to the misfortunes being made. In that way, the ineffieceinees of government lead to conflict, and be it at the back via the diplomats or on the frontlines with weapons, we must address said flames. Only, the great men of the world are not those who showed such moments of support; but rather the Hume's of the world, the Emerson's, the Smiths; those who thought, devled and conjured the means to stronger roots as not to produce such negativity. 
   <br>&emsp;Think of it, if the world worked, along the lines of commerce  lets say, as it had a millenia ago, would we have as much money? Management is one thing, and our ability to generate the goods of the market is the other; but generally, the bones of our world are in government; and via those commerical advents, so is the mold of government which permitts, and angles it at any rate, to take the form and shape it does. In that, the efforts  of man have not only risen with respect to welfare, but also in the nourishment of the economy. Nor is the global tilt of this a poor one. In that sense, the long term is perhaps what carries the weight of positivty; as those, along with taking time to cultivate, take comparable durations to manifest. While, the subjects of the current status are in need of immediate attention, as their symtpoms are acute. "Born from chornic aiilemtns of the roots, but flairing up at the given moment."
   <br>&emsp;I guess as a man, I am lacking, for I put little effort into helping those around me. Personally I am not so set, but those nearby do likely donate, and perhaps volunteer at a shelter, and otherwise are enrolled into public rolls which provide services. Me on the other hand, lacks such a place.

<div id="rightandcommon">
   My reflections are quite different then my deliberations, in that one has to do with me, while the other is bent towards the law, or at least something I am supposed to do. It is hard to say; especially if the minutia of the discussion is one tht ultimately lies in you, yet a sound reflection of that would measure up to a supposed rule. 
   <br>&emsp;I think the friction to our thought is in considering what we like, wbat we seek, what would measure to me some amount of pleasure, purpose or success, and looking at the obligations we have as a man, concerning the troubles of those in poor parts of the world, the ludicrous yet mentionable disruption of sex and racial differences, particularly. One one hand, I don't see much value in changing anything but the truth. For even if we tear it all donw, what will replace it? There may be improvments, but at that, it  seems like the proper design is paramount. And in that, I see little in terms of perfection; at least and rounded amount of depth. Plus, at any rate, if you consider the requirments to acquiring such truth, then you'd realize that your time was properly spent pursuing that. You may then go and rebel and carry over this new design; but so is the former without the latter premature; nor is it entirely warranted, for some of your reasons for revolting are not bound to a full truth. 
   <br>&emsp;It seems then, that if the truth were known, then the actual problems, or at least issues which were fair to attest, could be addressed. At least our action could be appropriately made -and lack any misplaced assumptions or conflations. Though, it seems that, beyond removing people by force, that since our authorities are elected, that education was the prime factor, in that those representting us will be so from an oriented populous. 
   <br>&emsp;This is beyond the point though. For I don't think theres any sense in attributing the blame of instances to summarized groups; as those are full of seperate members. And even if were talking about the government and its institutions, so are these divisions at best, and their own intracies at that. If it is true that a certain part of one group is causing trouble, then to them all we should reject. But we shouldn't identify the division as the entire problem; or conflate rather the errors of some of its members for the group as a whole -as that then points to members who are not in error. We can address the leadership and any policy which is selecting for or permitting such poor proclivites to manifest; but to a good extent, it is not the bosses crime to be an authority over someone who actually commits such crime. Change in his respect is fair, as is his releavnce as the authority a means to ramification. But that is not the point of other members, be it as workers or higher ups, who are not so directly responsabile for some indidvudals mistakes.
   <br>&emsp;These are broad terms though. As, the truth in all things is unknown; and when it comes to economy, civil rights, our quality of life and the general moldings of governance and service, so are we ill-defined in our view of these things, in an entire way at least; nor, to my point, have we actual given much thought to the facts of the matter. At least in that case, we would be mulling over the reality in play; while it seems more common for people to have reactions to thin impressions. And even if they are accuracte, so is that just a case. I am unconvicned that anyone knows alot about all; and there seems to be even more who know even alot about a little. And the point, is that on either side, so is our judgement required, or understanding at least. "In other words, our problem solving hasn't even begun, in that the reality of the situtation hasn't been identified or expressed." Also, to mention, those are sound in their awareness, but of a select part of the domain, are not themselves arbiters of other parts. And, weirdly, its odd how much even our specalists compare to those common and  feckless, in the areas which they are not specialists in. Or, case in point, if they are aware of a certain area, have they even given it thought? For I suspect they haven't, by virtue of their lack of reproach and assembly in the rest of the domain.
   <br>&emsp;Its just not the case that the absolute truth is one that is out of our favor. At least there's no strenght to this that is poorly stated. And otherwise, when it comes to the state of our lives, the best of us have problems whcih are generally self made, and are otherwise reminsicent of us not being the best version of ourselves -where we notice oppertunities slipping through our hands. Otherwise, when it comes to those who are worse off, so are they randomly produced; and on a larger scale even where some areas have more propensity, so are the misfortunes done to memebrs of that, which is itself random, or select. Whether these instances are the result of our primitive state, such as our less then democratic means for government, or are made through reprehensible means, such as genocide and corruption, fairs some distinction. But the accuracy for each ought to be the same; and at any rate, the proper representation should afford our reosltions as so. For, if a man is beaten due to discremination, then the attacker in question shold be dealt with accordingly. If we then extend this to other instances, we ought be clear on the details of those and the brevity to the patters, or relfections at least of any system which we'd then oppose. Personally I can speak to this not; yet, I am only on the psotive side which all things fall; yet admittedly ignoratnt to the details of what is presnet, however insubstanital it naturally is. But, the abbrasive opinions of those who profess otherwise, seem without any case. Their frustration isn't poor, nor is the repition of what they see an unfair reason for their response. But the range in which their criticism applies -being the entire police- is one which their arguments can't support. And again, the material which they reflect is not one of either inconsequence or pure abscence. But in my own igornace, I see that their response is one from a bounty of instances; yet, these don't total up enough in that front facing context to proprly explain or justify their response. And at any rate, my suspicion (wihtnin my ignoprance) rests on the likely small substance which their worries apply. As, the homicide rate of the world being (similar to the US) 6 per 100,000, I would not say that this suggests a rampant mishandling of police -or homicide prevention. And in regards to police brutality, if the number were a thousand even, I would say that this was somewhat substantial; but still, at least as we'd suspect that there were much more instances dealing with the police then that, would have me fairly believe that the brutality in question was uncommon -or present in a minority of situations. Which again, if the subsatnce is enough to really draw concern -beyond assessing each circumstance, but the theme- I still would say that argument agains the police system as a whole is an entirely weak one. Though I will stop, as I cannot securely vouche for the limits or extent of such concerms.
   <br>&emsp;Simply, theres nothing I know that doesn't point to inefficines and stale truths being the cause of negativirty. As oppposed to thinking the entire system is at fault, its really just the maturity of it, and reference by whicb it acts, that causes the members inside to perform and produce as they do. So I see no problem beyond the desired refinements which would lead to less instances of concern. But here, the call to action by the public seems hollow. As, learning the truth isn't soemthing that we throw to congress, or our representatives even. At least as a point of critiwue. Our place is in electing those who we believe to have the right ends in mind; and by that, educating those who vote, and even those who'd run, seems the fairest. Still, the treatment of the public and its effects is a daunting task; and hardly one that can be used against someone in not pursuing; particularly, when it is not the case that someone has a cure and fails to notify anyone; but rather that they'd find a cure for all, and failing to work for that is wrong. I think not. At any rate though, if I had some values and suspcion, then I could run myself and more direclty propose the changes I see. Even then, the truth is required. Nor is any large amount of people pursuing this; so I don;t feel like even the most furled brows are giving me or anyone scorn for that. In fact, we public oppostion to government seems to be in the core ways its managed. Ignorance of such functioning and division is hefty mind you; but at any rate, people don't care for the executive, nor those in charge of insitutions; nor do we see much more than advantagous selection in the high courts and things of similar caliber. Curriculum and polciy within public services may be one thing, but understanding the neccssary workings of such unions and how they can afford to change, is all we can be right in addressing. "And again, who knows enough to ask questions regarding that, and fair ones at that; and make suitable suggestions too." Its just hard when the world has some trouble, yet all there seems to be is a facade of those actuall involved with trunning the thing, and a layer of ignoratnt opposers who scrutinize that authority; but again, they usually do this in an all too general way, or if it is of someone speicifc, it rarely translates to how they are in non-related issues. "Like, what would be better, a genuis murderer who had the punctuality and means to solidify the economy; or a harmless nut, who held not much more than kindness and stupididy? We can take the latter sure, but at least not pretend like the former's abilities were the concner. At least, we'd be making the worst mistake, which is conflating one's personal actions and efforts, with seperate and irrrelvant issues. Trust sure, but at least hold some regard for the merrit in their resolution. Perhaps you could learn then, and elect another to run such attempt."

<div id="fromoutandin">
   Lets  say that our flow of life is in question. What this means, is that we are with ease, acceptence, security, along with love, wonder and strenght. How this is achieved though can be quite messy; as many things run contrary to one another. And at any rate, our effects from any of these can often render our awareness of things to be muted. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, much time can go, where some good is gained, while some is falterer; or too much bad made at any rate, and not enough dealt with which was fully in your control.
   <br>&emsp;The point, is that as this time goes on, that coming to terms with possible improvements, or remissions at least from the bad, can leave you with a mix up of aims and efforts. For none can idenitfy a mistake, and look to proceed as though the effect had been washed off; nor, the remedy ingrained and the alterantive run through.
   <br>&emsp;That is the point of discourse, as it bears wisdom to us in terms of the supposed course we should take. Some take their cues from testinonies of others, while others subject themselves only to reason. The latter seems better; though, a mistake can be in thinking that the measure for success is in meeting the reason delivered; as opposed to the user of the reason actually beenfiting. Which is to say, that reason runs our discourse, as to consider what is valuable and to inquire as to what things or actions fit. By that, reason is a scale, a level if you will, as to judge and dispose our actions so that they are more becoming and fair. In that, the results will be of actions which treat us to an experience we seek. "Which at the end of the day, is the basis for our reasoning, and thus assessment -where we find suitable canditates for the former's conclusion [what is good for what we desire]"
   <br>&emsp;In that scale we have decided that the quality of our life should remarkt the actual living. Where it gets complicated, is how in the shades of that can be forwardly bent; just as they may be worn out from weighing effects from the rear (or past strains). In that, the point is not to give the future little regard, nor forget the past, but to marshal ourselves across the points of living,  as to be considered, executed and accounted by values which remark how well we actually are. 
   <br>&emsp;Generally this amounts to a reductive state, as one may resolve themselves to be a politician, or a professional no less, but give little regard to the benefit given. The core sentiment rises, in that such person will likely be aware of the effort required to reach certain developments, and how money for instance, will be accordinglyt provided. Yet, the value of effort needed for such money to be received, is not what is in itself bad or good; only, these are things, items, subjects for judgement: and reason is our scale. And all she says, is that if you have to go over a mountain to receive a moment's reward, that this is not accessible or lasting. Compared to the efforts reminesicent of self regard, those are quite frequent in their accessibility, nor do their gains wain. Moreover, the complexion of the flavors are ones of a wholesome kind, whereas those who travel to visit some far off wonder, have but a brief period of novel excitement and awe. "What happens when you return home: will that wonder be employed for the goods there? Why did you need to go then if there was already so much around? Did you really need this shot of grandeur to see what was beautifull in the commons? And if you didn't know what was there, and thought only exoctic places could present something great, then what confidence should I have that you'd even see it there? Its as if your pallete was flat from tasting little local cuisuine; and so you went afar to try foriegn flavors; yet where is your ability to recognize those."
   <br>&emsp;It seems then, that in our case, the quality of our time is subject to the enivronemnt. For we are indeed split from the mobility which we experienced time ago. Nor, do our attendances have any leisurely means to reach them. This is fine, but does remove the finer coatings of these events: and they thus feel more like obligations then fun activities. Still, there is much to be said on the general scale, of being unreserved enough to stop in your moving tracks, and recuperate with the ease of rest and lighter activities otherwise. I can say in our personal state, that such form of things is accessible, albeit less than ideal. And at any rate, the rural nature of our living keeps the bounds of these affairs at a limit. Though it is appreciated that the kinds of things we'd do otherwise, are available, just not in number or novelty. 
   <br>&emsp;This at any rate gives me much hope for our future, whereby we move on to more urban lands. Right now though, I have but the surrounding itineraires and their offer of warmth, conpousre and pace. While the center, has its core in me with our liberties and delight, and otherwise affords more bounds from leniance, integrity of depth and desire, and otherwise an otherwise felicious use of resources and time, as to afford ourselves more impatcfull means of satiating ourselves -ie. our scooters ability to bring us around.

   I don't think we are being asked much. Sure, if we were keen, or at least privy to something and a prompt to it, we'd amend; but our real actions, or bearings at least, seem to come from our happiness, and whether or not we are in fact so, of whcih our actions tend to freely come by -or hanker at the means to being so happy.
   <br>&emsp;By that, I can't think of anything more than what we are ripe to do. In that, I see that our unhappiness is in fact due to the nature of our interests; in that they were not of a skilled sort, but creative; whereby we set off on nothing more than to contribtue; yet were not so privilaged to have the open means to do so. Again, if we had some skill or credit, than our route could be direct. But as it were, nothing is what were starting with, and were making something from that. It seems then, that any pursuit of these kinds we'll see you in a barenless state, of success at least. But still, our invovlement can still bring purpose and pleasure; and otherwise solidify our grounds as to more easily and plentfiully sprout industry, attention and care. In that, I am not so grieved at the reality of our coming ways; whereby before, there was but a step into all; while now, there is many. 
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, the struggle is one of adjustment; whereby our hopes and exepectations were of those grander sorts. These, as it seems, come to those who have been consistent. And the virtue of promise is that no justification is required in terms of time, only effort. But still, as the mass of those anticipations wane, so are we left with our head up high, excited to do more, and then pleased to see what such course can offer. But we have to enter, our first day, a new month, the apprentice period. 
   <br>&emsp;Oddly, I can attest to the ease, peace and outlook of our fragments. Which, as it was, held much dissmay on the early part of the road. But now, that we see our writing, dating, career, and even our more casual invovlemnents set for our openess to finally spring on, you'd think that this primary effort from earlier would unveil some of the unneccessary worrying; and otherwise instill some confidence that our fears will wain; or are at least unmerrited. 
   <br>&emsp;It just seems like our efforts are one, that the more we do, and that or place becomes one where another step is the task, we loose our grand scheme, our idle ambition; and otherwise, there is much impetus placed on us, be it in our hopes of being impressive, or justifying our way of living. These, are but marks of an unactioable mind. And at any rate, in our private ventures, so were the early outputs of that reassuring to those around me. By that, if our grandest step is in fact set on the first part of a thousand, so are we fine to feel secure. And, by our fragments, we are still going, and that seems to be recieved well. Or, in another sense, we are not asked much more than too try; and the only critcism received is when we don't.
   <br>&emsp;In that it is only up to you, that you can take this following step, whereby the armor and sights of old are removed, and the meager progress of the real world is your claim, and vantage point at that. We can do this. And at any rate, I think we will be happy. I am not sure if there is this big problem to solve, and by me at least. But, whatever we could do, on the scales of our real ability and merrit, is one that only comes about when action is taken. By that, we may be humbled; or, more likely, a mix of reality will come into the given promise of trying. At that, we may be right to simply be happy, putting our writing on a suitable platform, dating, looking for work, and otherwise framing our realm of living as we please. "The base of that is quite grown admittedly, from our scooter to the meager amount of work required; and its fair nature at that." 
   <br>&emsp;We just need a future that is going somewhere. And not by virtue of employment, as to our dream or hasty enrollment. But from action, which breathes a sense of continuaty, and the ease and foresight treated by that. 
   <br>&emsp;Where can you go, or be, and what? This is all that needs be know. For that pressing weight of where it will go, is really from the minor pinch of not being invovled at all. "And doing so, is alright."
</div>
<div id="looseclarity">
   I feel like I know so little of what is true. Our past has come, yet the recent memories are one where the future is more peacefully apparent: yet I cannot approach it. In some sense, I feel bad in not doing so; and considering the good there would be, or at any rate the poor remark for the occupation we don't have, so is there an opening to me which feels smeared upon, by my mother in particular. Still, we are just ironing our way; and be it thorugh some local attempt, or one which reaches the stars, we are rooting ourselves towards that.
   <br>&emsp;Theres just this question; as to why we are so troubled, and whether or decisions are really basing themselves on the right thing. Again, the remedy I seek is to this perceived apathy; or, worse, the unawarenss from others, and the sole relation I have with my mom and dad bearing upon me their suspicion. In that however, I don't know where I should go. I am having a hard time to say. And in this, we are admittedly unset, or arranged for some end. The grieving from this seems secondary then, as even if we were on our own, fortunate even to distract ourselves from our lack of consistency, or committment at least, so would the colors of the world eventually wain. We need some purpose, some why, some direction that keeps us set, to somewhere I know. Still, it is possible that our idling time is but the source of this; for we are not so privy to contempt or certainty when we are engaged. And perhaps, the development ware on us and its consequent privation, has led me away from common nourishments that would otherwis be accesible, and treat you to a point of consatnce, and thus no idling despair. 
   <br>&emsp;Theres just this thing, like we have an anwser. Or better, as I'd describe, is this intuition that if we just focus on ourselves, then the reflections, deliberations and output of that will grow to a point of vibrant solidity. And there is truth in that; both in the product, and our insight to the neccessity of ourselves in doing so; whereby we give ourselves leave to attend other things, and thus receive the warmth and security that our pleasure, peace and work require. Yet, in that vital state, the imagery I see is not so clear; or at least it affords no defintion. Or, in a way, it holds nothing that our actions can meet, in terms of the image at hand. It seems, in this case, that what we see is our work being spread; at least, as we have merrit, so are we keen to expect attention. Yet, having the work is different then spreading the work. As well, friends fall in this line, whereby your invovlement with things would surely expose you to more; but an infatution with yourself would not neccessarily follow, but instead require you to make relations as you would in your everyday stead now. Even then, when we consider what we would like in fortune, it is the ability to move; as doing so gives breadth and relief from our stale scenery. This is a mighty wish, and large in its requirmewnts to let its whims go out. Yet, the practice of it is really broadened due to your unoccupation; whereby, being so, removes all lust, and places your attention on the scenery at hand. It just seems like there is our private assembly, and the world outside our door; which draws hope born from interest, but also settles as the only point of progress which our family and heart suggest. Yet, the actuall things which would make you happy, or at least the elements which your idle mind sees in that broader world, is nothing which your localle couldn't provide. And, the point, is that even if that worldly view came to fruition, so would those elements be acquired no differently; or, at any rate, would not come due to the complexions of that wordly way. Instead, it seems, that if we are happy then we are open; and the prudsih side of our otherwise private heart, is drawn to an increase of that happiness through the world. Yet, all this remarks what that world doesn't even provide. What you wan't is to do as you please and feel unmitigated; yet, in our personal occupied lives, the amount of external occupation is small; and by that, relations, meaning and skill, come to fruition simply. Only, in that way, the world seems out of sight; and our early steps into those meager lanes, feels both a starting ground, and without much of a future beyond what our passion sees.
   <br>&emsp;Part of the problem is that it is hard to see what something really is. A dating site for instance which charges you 30$ a month is an odd ask, and if it otherwise offers nothing without payment, then this option is subject to those conditions; yet our judgement then under those parameters may not act as our wishes suppose. At least, the restriction may set our use of it as impractical, for the novelty and curisoity of it has no place within that price. And, regarding our writing, it is hard to see beyond the general submission guidlines, and their selective, long waiting process; combined with the unique piece your working on. And my concern, is that to be generous and invovled, comes at to much a cost to real imapct and revelance. Yet, if we are to forgo that as a concern, then writing may not be a thing at all; for we'd just do what we actually want to, and sharing what we have already written seems beside that. For, those words spoken, are really built under this notion that someone would surely want to read them. "I jsut cant picture this reality, where your merritable words leave but stronger impression; and that beasides your select oppertunities to do something precise and grand, that you really just continue to post, as if you were big or small." By that then , the bulk of those posting efforts seem to be the scale we should judge by. For it appears quite nieve to think that even the greatest thing ever said would in fact push the ocean of other things aside. At least, bringing such work to notice feels mightil hard. And at any rate, the way to do so is to build experience elsewhere, and have that be the source of sparks which catch another's eyes.
   I would say, in video terms at least, that if your video gets a 100 views, then it was wortwhile to share. And if it got a 1000 views, then it is worthwhile then to care; and to consider at least what you would do later on, under the expectation that such views profress a future sufficiency. If your audience, or subscibre count was that much, so woudl that suffice as a means for conversation. In a way, were all pointing up at the moon; which is to say that there is this frontier, or space of truth which we are trying to find. And, I think thats why we are so fine alone, and happy when we are engaged; for what matters is in our hand. Yet, only the furthest things really draw that out when your alone, as casual strides are not so enticing alone. And, practically, the point at least is perhaps the reason for said truth, why it is important, and the nature of doing so with excellence yet private; and how, with some relief from folly and developmental ware, that the surroudning elements of your inquiries can in fact be exciting themselves, if not warming and securing for the paces of those higher efforts.

<div id="amarkofme">
   So short and sweet, we've found our way. Frankly, it settles itslef in the groove of our actual life, which is in some important ways unoccupied, or substantial at least; whereby the private dreams of being known, as if the world were on step further out your door, is gone. By that, our happiness is a remark of me. And theres no need to worry about your own efforts being the objective; and, subscribed, or present, to the common flow of the world. At least, if one is the king of england, or someone of success of prestige, so are the details of that whats important. For they may have experiences that you don't, and many perhaps over time that have brought them to their ends. And at that, the worth of those ends are judged under quality, rather than rose tinted appearences. And at any rate, any amount of genuine success they have, is admired; or, in terms of our own route to success, it is not encouragment were seeking or hacks, but an understanding of how our purpose can be brought out. "Give me the general rules and specific guidlines that will let our particular interest grow." At least, I can say that the outlets for anything more are not occupations themselves, but journeys, ventures, skirmishes. Yet the war of our life is fought on the groundfloor; especially when you consider the real effects of those former, where their loot and plunder would be delivered to that groundfloor. Their objective may seem foreign, prestigous and great, but so are these for select fruits and the nourishment they can bring to our commons. For everyone is living their lives; and be it of a poltician or simple cobbler, all writing, art and impact can do, is nudge someone in slightly different direction. "As if our suggestion grew a favorable result over them." In this, there is much that anyone can say; and there is to be fair much fortune and infamy from doing so. Yet the actual merrit of our ways is in how we spend our own life. For even if others are better'd, so are we privy to our own time; which feeds little on the memories of what we've done. Nor, is a single large entry worth a hundred one's of vibrant thought and care. At the very least, our mightest speeches can't make up for a lack of leisure, industry and care. 
   <br>&emsp;On that note I can say that I am looking for something to do. I see the oppertunity to prioritize our interest in fragmented writings and wordly treatment for our youtube channel -via shorts- while the draw we have of our own writing -and its treatment and care- can be goverend on a platform of its own. A place to put it, out there, able at least to shown or seen; something to stand by, as remarking your interest: which, is to place our writing, having delt it, and understood what we had to say. All doubt or grief over the merrits of this, are out of principle; for the aim of this is not goverend by where we'll go or what we'll recieve, but how we are arranged in task and output. Which, as it were, holds nothing more than addressing whats been said, and refining that as to bring out its content. And, due to our need of this, being from ourself, you need not worry about things your not unfamiliar with; as of course you see less with them; when in fact, our approach, is to become familiar with what were not. And the road to that is withotu hindrance. At least, as the purpose of it is aside from your overall mission and glory, so are we fine to do these because we are pleased. Ease may take in, and our confidence and or curiousty may take us to such oppertunities. But so is this the merrit of all solidity within our life. Which, as it were, hoddles only when it is too subject to those outer flames, deluded into thinking that is where we want to go, when we in fact just want to stop saying no to what we already seek, infront of us in liberal acitivty.

<div id="forcash">
   Things always bug you indeed. But I find that the real problem, despite being caked in fear of somethig internally daming, is being able to let yourself in, and expereince the product at hand. For all things, be it games or industry, so will time iron things out. "We must only continue."
   <br>&emsp;I see how success, or making money at any rate, is one of competion and caliber. This is different though then doing something for itself, whereby theres an extensive factor which is more readily met. In practice, we have interests, ideas, values; or in other words, we see the world, and merely wish to see it more. OUr privation can cause the doings of others to be poorly recieved, as their flare and promotion rubs against our inactivty. But if we are otherwise occupied, then we can admire what is there, be glad for their successs, and pass on any critiques or disharmony (for us). For we are already made.
   <br>&emsp;In that, the freedom of our paces, brings me to see where our effort could go. In that, I see little which would afford the gradneur of that; which, in essence, brings us outside the harder strides that money and success require. We are just trying to be me, simply, and with some further breadth. Not everyone will care, and views are no strict measure. But if you consider the paradigm of house, bronze, silver and gold, I see that second as a fair target for our highest industry. At least, not much more could be accounted for, in terms of why we did what we did, and how our reception could be given on that basis. Further tiers are ancillarly, as you can only know so many, and collaborate on a certain scale. "Or care at least to some extent, while remaining steady within the subjects."
   <br>&emsp;When we look at the quality of our lives, we realize that most of it is but a garnish, or luxury. Money is fine but in fact adds little to the bulk of our lives. For, it is occupation which settles us, and lets us feel integrated, open and treated. By that, money may give room for more; but in fact, it is for things broader then your common efforts could procurr. And the main point of finace, is that it is a means; and considering the effort required to make it robust, as opposed to sufficient, renders even the largest luxuries a pointless place. For, in practice, the point is that if you could somewhere, it would because somewhere was good to go. And, in terms of flavor, or uniqeuness at any rate, less you merely pass by, and are instead living from place to place, then in each the place the effective properties of it are of its color and form. It is important to remember this, as going somewhere is not substanital in terms of your life less the actual living is gained; which, as it were, is defined by the particular colors on display. Having moved is one thing, but so is this a remark of unoccupation. The point, is that less those are the benefits, than the effort required to afford mere luxury and adventure feels to brief and besides the point. In a way, a life which is treated by the color of the world, is one which is active. In that, there is no limit on how little you should seek besides this; for in those activities, you cannot end how much you throw yourself in. By that,  we can evaluate something based on the worth, in that it would in fact procurr the means to expereince color in its various ways, and not under the burden of something which even makes that favorable. For I see much in this world, and work personally to greet it. Whats leftover leaves room for our perfection to slack, while we incorporate ourselves in more nourishing and steadying things. Were still going you see, as if were already at the edge, and trying to keep up; rather than being made as to begin. At least, what draws you out of yourself is not worthwhile under the notion that anyone really cares, and that you can go past what brought you to this rightehous state. Those means are merely habitual, done without notice, but required no less. You merely have the means to tend your garden as the soil has been tended; but so must it be toiled as need be, and watered at that. Its only as time goes, that those tasks become fair and manageble; and the fruits surpass the value in simply being stable, but abundant.
   <br>&emsp;That is my point about money; that it ought not take an arm and a leg, in either practice or employment; nor, is even the smallest amount of truoble worth any contray sacrifice if the value is not there. Money is not valuabe in its own right. And considering what is valuable, it is fair to see that theres no limit on this. For that is the nature of leisure, industry and care. And as it were, pleasure, purpose and success come from the excessed of those liberties, whereby their common paces make use of our otherwise afforded progress; whereby our ease, solidity and insight, procurrs developments of a more substantial kind. "Whereby we have more hands working on our ship to the moon." Or at any rate, there is the casual side of this, of recuperation, while we privately or coopertively tend the lens to see the world, while we take restorative time to see others, and be seen. Though, this is but a remedy born from the unneccsity of our findings being perfect; or staked on something which is born from folly and doubt (of such liberty).
   <br>&emsp;By that, I see that our common concerns of money, health and understanding, is becoming fairer and fairer, as to procurr not only the strenght and rbeadht of our leisure, craft and care, but also enough for these to settle as points of themselves; whereby we then need no perfect mark to begin, but a consistent pace to continue stairing, and furthering our map of the world; the excitment of which offers its own genuine and whole riches; and at any rate, the recession from that perfection means that our hope is one bonr from our happiness in this liberal way (and its own extent); whereby our contedness comes from our engagement, paired with the just spot in being so, and our arrangment to merely proceed: here, we can take our own time, and spend on warmer invovlenets, as to feel integrated as a breathing man, but also feel secure in our indsutrious way: as the security of being a member of the world keeps me settled in our fortune to already be so. "In that, we have our back to begin; the front of which is more painting; whose end is not but the cramp of our hand, and the fairness of its dissolve."

<div id="commonway">
   In a nutshell, there is what we do, and our life around. The core of the former brings no longing conquest for the latter. But so is that former not banked on acquriing us relief or vanity from the latter. In this, we are in no need to treat it beyond our judgements; which, as it were, extend to not point past our doing well, as we deem.
   <br>&emsp;Still, our world is in need of regard often, for we can feel unoccupied, and bear down the scutiny, pity and seperation as follows. Simply, we are obliged to our common ways. And, as our efforts have settled, there are meager things near and around me. The details are imoprtant, as we are not looking for further occupation, but remidial tasks that seem oppertune. Working at superstore is all that is. Though, the mobility of working online, or having a skill which you can leverage seems wortwhile. But still, the ease which we profit it from it must make up for the 'work' in it; otherwise, our enjoyment of it can be an ointment to any required development or  employment. I am not clear, as I am on substack for instance, as to what jobs those may be. In terms of the reward and demands, yoga has never struck me. Nor, as it is often suggested, has TSL sparked my interest while I was occupied. For the former, the actual employment seems sparse, in interest at least. Being an instructor is fine, but it isn't something I strive to do; for I don't really feel like I am teaching, but demonstaratin; which lacks any precision or abundance. And, despite being something which an agreeable hue, the actual merrits of its occupation seem but a preferable form of otherwise stationary work. Having credit does have its oppertunites, but only to change the color of our lives, not the pace of it. Even then, the transitions would not be more accpetable than they are right now. On that note, I would bring up the value of being able to move aorund, in that you lose your ability to cultivate friendship and community. Integration is not limited anywhere, but its really for yourself. Admittedly, this nomadic pace is hard to acquire, or invovling at least. And considering the benefit of it, I don't feel so struck by it. If I were given it now then sure, but it still feels like a remedy to the common paces of stationary living; yet the care for this has become more novel than a dream. Still, if we could like more domestically while being mobile that would offer great beneift. But when I consider the comparions between moving around town easily, and otherwise being tied to a rooted post, I see the actual fruits and garments of said life nearly identicial. As it were, the profit of mobility is your freedom to be with yourself, as you can do as you please. Yet, when you consider the benefit and desire to be more communal and secure, so do those advents of mobility and privation whither away. My point is that in our common place, I am not weary about being outside of a station less common; as the desires of the one employed, are not so privy to our occupations and invovlemnets. "At best, they give me the freedom to be me; yet in that, there is not much that our solid self cant find delight, simply, and wholly bent to our dearest ways. From that, our actual interest and needs that foster so, are developed over time and through being open; which our mobility seems to offer an angle to that, but of one which does not remark the real benefit of mobility, which is our own personal activity. And at any rate, travel seems to flatten such development. Or, in short, travel and mobility as in all other pleasurable things are desired and a fortune; but so are the roots of them born from our discontent: the remedy of which comes when we occupy ourselves and invovled our time with that which is near and infront. And those outward ventures either run contrary or have but indifferent or novel impacts. So why worry, or feel less, lost, left out. Our life of living bears witness only to its real end, and the means to such claim."

<div id="wordssofar">
   So you have the fragments, which compared to our writings, is a piece meal effort. In its case, we look at a subject such as geography, or an essay such as Moral Progress, and we see the various points which strike us, and we treat those specifically. As a form, our means is in tex to speech, as it is project fairly, and of a different, richer and deeper tone; also, on the prolific scale, it is simply easier to have it done through TTS than ourselves. Perhaps we can learn, but the means to do so well and with efficient cost is there. Now, we aren't helbent on the lenght, or dimension mind you, but due to the smaller treatments, it seems that a format more becoming to that is fitting: which is reels. By that, we have the background, our subtitles and audio, all put through the assembly line in premiere. Like we did with our BF shorts, we take the words in the case of writing, script them, convert into audio and make the subtitles, then slot them in with ease. When it comes to visual aids, such as music or a person, so is this fine with passing pictures, sliding them as to add some movement, or anything along those lines. In fact, the imagery and its creation is another part of the script; and so when were talking about charts and maps, so will we need to match our selection of those with the portrait formatt. Or perhaps we can find room for briefer videos of a full format. At any rate, I see this side of things as a place to treat David Hume, or Emerson's Scholar and divinity. Plutarch and Montainge seem obivous, but so is there room for cosmology, the greats, the breadth of craft and devices, and our own sums. Such seems fair. And considering the manageble use of images fit to the portrait -and designed at any rate, simply- so is the real limit of these creations one of words and their audio conversion. That is quite fine in my mind, and easier as we go. And in terms of our own production, we see a day as a place for one; which means that a quarter needs 90. It seems within our reign to make some magnitufe of 20 or so per week, which means that a month can create several more. And, considering efficeincy and the clustering of relevant subjects, so may our efforts condense, into several weeks being produced in one, or half a year being made in 6 weeks. 
   <br>&emsp;On the other side sits our writing efforts. Which, compared to Hume, who we merely wish to define, in our own words we mean to refine. As we have indeed said them; and not one seems unfitting for ourselves and the measure of us. So, in amends, we see a grip and tailor of such work, as to become more acquianted, and in effect smoothing out the roughness and windiness of the entries. In that, there is much. And whereas our fragments is going and needs no reverence for fortune or ends, so are we still prior in our writing output; which is to say, that we do wish to do it, as work and a thing, but in which manner and form, so has our integrity to it not fully settled. Practically, Substack seems our place, as we can organize each chapter, the design is nice, and overall the platform seems kind to our sort, and has accompanying features for future products -ie. podcasts, letters and discussions. In short, it seems a place for us to do our writing; and in that, there is a mixture of promise, oppertunity, confidence and ease. That latter though is the breeze though by which our sails should flow, as our work is our object; with all things other being but moths drawn to our treatment. "But so doth the God of fire seek and act in the flame; only those around, by their natures, will burn, while he at best rakes the coals."
   <br>&emsp;The factors of that object begin with our spring writings, which as a case in point, relish the thought of us giving them some time and care. For, you see, at least what I know and continue to live as though relevant, is born from these thoughts; and returning to them as to make them new and mine, gives us leeway to offer them as our sign, for they are better made: and no matter who feels such sparks, so are with free on approach, for our confidence is born from us being clear and happy in what we say. Following these roots is our Poem, which finly details the origins of reproach, and the limit which follows. This section holds our winter writings and its aspects of history, then the time in Vancouver and its sprouting of joy, followed by the formalities of our nature and aims. Rounding out comes after, and holds a mighty slew of objectives, dear thinking, along with solid theological and absolute regard. Near Light centers all of this, with ostentation and division marbling those early thoughts, along with our sentiment of man as a subject, by which the heat on our hand affords a response no different than the peace of our mind. Warm Winters may combine with that prior section as it is much looser than most sections; though there are some fine works such as the Manor, Letter to a friend. And, perhaps when we consider the treatment we'd give and familiarity we'd bear, so might the pieces of these realm be most deserving. For they are in fact the most casual in their elaborative degree, and by that can make use of a tigthening. Beyond, remarks our strongest paces, as we convey the meaning of Art, and how it is no different than our nresponse to a breaking twig; whereas, to remove idlenss and its regrets, so do we gaze to postivie things, but therein draw an equally needed response -but of liberty. We also mention death, nothing, subjects and the otherwise settled nature of our lives. Past this, there is much personal thought, which aside from our memoroy of it, has much material and color to be helmed. "And thats what I say to most things, that if theres something there, grab hold, smooth its edges, better its structure and the means in which its heart is expressed, and our life will be fine. For that is what I'd like most to do. And comparing this to our fragments, in that, I already like, as I've done, where there are no questions: and our substack can be the binding means to reach the same."

   Life seems to always be progressing; better yet, it goes through cycles, be it weekly, monthyl, yearly: even the beginnings of a new life beyond the one live so far. 
   <br>&emsp;And I must admitt that I struggle to make constant reroutes based on prior cycles. Perhaps, this is due to us making amends so quickly, that if a current cycle lacks emphasis of some lesson or rule I care not, for we will go on to the next. Or, at any rate, we make grand changes every period or so, that the permanence of these lays roots for the minor developments to come and go as they please.
   <br>&emsp;Generally, the cause of this near term shuffles is due to an overall lacking in our deepest end. By that, I know not what makes me important; and that if I truly went were I sought to, and in effect was myself, then there'd seemingly be no one: at least we'd all be apart. In that, I see so little of who I am; for all things other seem to be elsewhere. But that is no indictment to something poor, but rather a settlement outside what was once common; and letting that come to life in its own wild way: be it amongst familiar aspects, or in its own frontier.
   <br>&emsp;I see how our desires and aversions are all amuck, or constrained at least under what we truly seek. But, in our lack of clarity and strenght to see and admitt such things, we find ourselves hesitant to go that way: whereby we'd then bring that to life. For, it seems true that out of fear, you may not go where you want; but in that, you tend to run in spot, or grind against alternatives -making little progrss. This is the real problem, in that our inability to see and affirm our aims, we struggle with being where we want, if only well directed.
   <br>&emsp;Near the root of this is our regards to travel. Or, in a broader sense, what compells me, and the shades and complexion of things which draw our steps and development. Simply, the colors of nature are what spark my eye. The layout of the land, its glare from the sun and moon, the sky floating above with all its clouds and texture. Even the plainest elements of roads, paths and trees: these all delight me. Or, in short, they are the elements which bear relevance. If I went to Egypt, I would notice the vista and its relation to the Pyramids: I would care little for them in and of themselves. I don't have a brochure in my mind which longs for or is giddy towards the cultural milestones abroad. Rather, all cities are on land, and as such are subject to the textures and shades of that land. Which, in a way, affords me the ripe efficiency of finding all in all things, novel; for there is not much in such domain, which isn't present everywhere. No where lacks the sun, or moon, or sky, or land for that matter and its molding of such vibrance and shades. Going to some far place is nice, but its only treatment is a different mixture of those elements. Sure, some places have different spices, i.e, the desert, jungle, aurora, the sea even. But I would not go to Italy simply for the pizza, nor France for baguettes. At least, this would be an expensive venture for something so trivial. That is, something so short lived and novel. "For, if you said that you wanted the prescence of those foods in your life -in all their purest cuisine- then I would retort, with the fact that you are only visiting, and briefly I presume: so which prescence is that? A relationship would not hold up if it were onnly so: yet, of such relations, the best things are judged by: at least, the quality of our life is judged on the relationships we have. Which, in effect, bears little merrit to superior moments and off handed experiences, as no relation is had."
   <br>&emsp;What I want then is of the kind which is liberal. Namely, to treat the Greats, color the stars, cement our mind (and learn it), and otherwise progress in our limited ways, with a firmness and ease, as to carve out a true experience which acclimitzes itself as the end, but in that bears more clarity for benefits and means. That is a gradual life, born from the back, whereby we affirm the attraction of all puruits and contentment.
   <br>&emsp;And this does seem to be fair, and enrichening to say the least. Yet, its pace is not always so; and, althoug there is much which can furnish our kind of way, so are clear on where such ends are headed: at least, where we are to be, what we are meant for, what we can expect, hope for, wish for, work towards, anticipate and otherwise know to see: in our time, on our land, in this world, 'outside the realm of not'.

<div id="tiltofman">
   Something which always tags behind me is this sense of contribution; which itself comes from a mix of stasifaction from dreaming of so, and seeing our means to do so. But, I think that this can get too carried away; not only in your antiicaptions, whereby the reward for being helpful is deemd. But also, in feeling poor when your time tends to yourself, and has little edge or bend to those impactfull ends. By that, the symptom comes when our personal time is sluggish, fairly lets say; but you feel this need to prove yourself, and otherwise feel exiled under the false efforts of your way. This is more a reflection of whether or not your happy, which itself has no solid bound. But still, let us remove this notion that we are a savior, or anyone for that matter. When it comes to climate change, asteroids, clean energy and even things of the polis, there are thousands (of a high count) of reserachers, service men, engineers, public servents and all things between, who are employed by a bevy of governments around the world to treat the slips and knots of the world. The common man, sweeps his alloted street, or waits on those nearby; while these specialists solve particular problems. In that, you may equally specialize, or otherwise mingle with the labors and affairs of common people. 
   <br>&emsp;From this though, a pernicious sentiment of education arrives. Not in a kid going to school to learn grammar, but those who seek to enlighten folks to the ways of the government, the issues of the world: the journalists if you will. Or even those simply trying to foster community; for the sake of women's health for instance, or some local concern within a town. This is a diffiuclt action to place. For those invovled are not the electies themselves, or specialists; nor are they so personal within their normal paces. I would say that these peopel are ordinary, but like a hobby or craft, seek to make a difference; at least, the involved themselves in discourse, leadership, community and perhaps fun. The reason may be that there upset, or that their drawn to something with purpose; which, it seems, joins their civil standing with the leisure of such ways, and how things of a meaningfull sort are but more wholesome kinds of pleasure -or acitivites at least which they are free to do. Most spexialists, outside their common similirarites, are not impacting the world in such ways as normal citizens. There improving the water supply, the means of organizing files for the sake of law and commerce; or their gathering intelligenc, and establishing the devices to do so. In that, it is worth noting that these speciilaize folk can be of a developing or servicing sort; as in those who engigneer aircraft carriers, those who fly, and those who use the equipment delivered. These are not coooks though, nor teachers even and secretaries. There in the field so to speak.
   <br>&emsp;And so for me, I can remark how all things come to be by the shared whole which all stands on; but that each knot and bind really comes at those points; and how these engagments are nothing but natural. In that, there is no guarentee of seomthing happening. Instead, the factors which compoound to produce a speicfic end (or alltercation), is only whats worth regard. This is hard to due though, as one cannot fairly generalize all aspects of the world. Still, we should have some reproach then in our attempt to do so, or at least round ourselves out as we can. Otherwise, we can attest to the small density of issues, despite their significance in the smallest amount.
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps we are doing the right thing then. For the world is in no dire straits, at least in any natural way, and what someone speicfic can do. "There seems to be so many points addreswed, and so many nudging." I'm fine then to nudge or own civil repsonsabilitites, and leave the frame to those specializewd for that. At least, less we pick a point and equally prioiritize, then the resolve is with scrutiny of a whim. 
   <br>&emsp;In our case though, our attempt to be more broad in our civility is far away as it is grand. So by that we'll take the natural appraoch; for our humors, passions and irritations are no reputable factor to be driven by -in our draw to such public matters.

<div id="farandgreen">
   So in the year 2414, the space administraton sent 15 vessels to reach to range of stars. Each vessel held families and members, each within their respective groups (per ship) as familiarity had bore them while on Earth. The advent of propulsion had not reached anything akin to lightspeed, but the veolicities reached were of a tremendous rate. 
   <br>&emsp;Our solar system is housed in a bubble; which like most classes of things -ie. galaxy, bubble, group- ours was merely the local one. That bubble held some stars, but together, drifted with other groups on whats called the radcliffe arm; which itself, was a little knick in the perseus sprout of the orion arm -which was one of the main branches of the galaxy. Obviously, the resolve of this operation was not to reach far into the galactic realm, but instead find worlds that were able to support the industry of man. 
   <br>&emsp;The world's economy at this point had levelled off to what it was in modern times, as technology and ethics had caught up and begun to outpace the bellies and loins of people. In that, there was room to invest a great sum into this space-expidition. The goal, simply, was to land these settlers on their respective planets, and allow them to be. As it were, the means for transport was in something akin to cryo-sleep, while the vessel was managed via computing. Due to the propulsive nature of the trip, only 100 light years could be travelled within 60-70 years -as some regions of space varied in molecular density. By that, the motion of this expidition was one akin to the first long range craft of man, Voyager. As that was meant to merely go and drift away, so were these settlers. The realities of this held conseqeunces which were merely logistical; and considering the centralized plan which the administration eventually sought, so was it impractical to consider outside the grandest time span. by that, a more intricate detachment would be sent, where a real establisment would be placed out in this new community of settlements. Communication was never so limited, but transportaion was. By that, the virtues required for each vessel and team had to be self sufficient for a great deal of time. At any rate, as time would go on, limited only by food and the community which fostered it, the rotation of centuries did call for additional supplies and converse between the colonies and the central hub. While the colonies had means to support themselves, their engineering and manufacturing potential was on a smaller scale. The central hub however, held mightier means, and could serve as an actual soucre and provider of improved tech, and overall supplies. As it were, most of the colonies remained close to 100 people, growing to severla hundred over the first stretches of time. But, it was not unrealistic to expect that as millenia went on, that these numbers would expand, and would thus require further infastrucutr.
   <br>&emsp;The core mean to this is in elemental recygcling. Whereby, something akin to carbon fibre and other selected polymers, allowed for the molds of life to be harnessed, and thus employed for an efficient means of production. By that, the contents of the atmospehre could be converted to water and oxygen, or the material in the ground could be fertilized for the use of agriculture. The colonies each had their means to achieve this for there personal groups, while the central hub held means to supporting a civilization. "Though its objective was not to grow a population into the millions; its goal none the less was to make use of its broader assortment of tools and tech, as to make an excess of supplies that could re-supply the colonines per century, and otherwise permitt further expansions and (population) growth." As it were, the central hub had no means to produce the vessels which would launch from earth. That is something which would have to later arrive, or take centuries to develop as the hub was established. So, for now, the current millenia was focused on the current colonies, and the central hub rooting itself in as the adminsitrivative center for this galactic part of the neighborhood. From there, further expiditions could be made. At any rate, some of the vessels are still travelling to their destination, while those which have landed have done so after centuries of travel. The central hub has only just been established. And as it were, our plans for the eons ahead, marks little care for the everyday happenings of people in these new localles.

<div id="nearandplenty">
   As it stands, the initial vessels launched in 2414. Each could go a speed of nearly three quarters lightspeed; but considering the acceleration from launch into coasting, and any density of debris, the effective pace was about 70% LS. In terms of destination, the tools at each ships disposal was such that a certain configuration within the atmosphere and soil would allow for survival to ensue. Upon reaching the front door of their respective planets, they'd refine their topographical view -as the general atmosphere and climate was already known through spectorsopcy. Here, having already assessed the seasonal range of the climates and those respective effects per latitudes, a general area would be scouted, and upon closer look, an actual terriotory would be spotted. Across the board, the aim was of the relatively temperate zones. This wasn't due to the benefit received on earth, as agriculture in these settlements could be garnished internally (without rain or anything of the sort). Instead, it was simply to avoid the extreme heat and cold and the equator and polar regions.
   <br>&emsp;There are many star systems you see, in all directions from earth. But, the general goal was to create an interstellar network. Not one, as mentioned, for quick travel, but something which would allow for millenial sustenacne. In otherwords, if we took a chart and viewed earth at the center, then the settlements which were several hundred light years apart in different difrections, would effecitvley be double from eachother. Moreover, the central hub's objective was to sustain the network for millenia's to come. In that, the viable planets were selected from a similar quadrant. As it were, life wasn't the pre-requisuit, but rather the proper atmosphere and geolgoy which would allow for refurbishment. At the very least, what the tools given to each colony could make use of, set the scale by which suitable localles were judged by. And considering that, many planets within their respective systems were viable. And as it were, along a certain bearing, with a radius of 200ly on each side, out to about 800 to 1200ly, there was on average 2500 systems. Considering the 15 vessels sent and the central core, the room for preferance and particularity was available. As it happened, some planets held liquids akin to water; some, had the beginnings of microbes; though none developed enough to become beyond that. Some however had things akin to grasses; but very few held anything more than that. As far as the earth bound data could tell, there was nothing terrestial -in an animal sense. More planets than you'd expect held fauna, but the annals of their environemnt gave no rise to anything more than that. Some could, and on a few planets there had been indicators of something eukaryotic: but nothing more than that.
   <br>&emsp;Where our story begins is in one of the further outposts,  1123 LY out. The central hub established itself after 980 years of travel -all while the quickest settlements landed at 760. Most, settled after 800, the average being 835. The furthest was actually 1202, but beside it and the one already mentioned, the height of the range for most is near a 1000. One important note, is that although space flight remained propulsive, the speed in which it could be garnered increased to something closer to 85% lightspeed. Seeing as the initial vessels left around 2400, and arrived from 3200 to 3500, the advent of the flight came  some centuries after depature. But, the speed was a bit faster, and by that, closed the gap between the initial settlements and the new arrivals. As it happened, the subseuqent depatures were aimed at filling out the quadrant rooted by the central hub, and to also furnish that hub with more mechanistic means. By that, there was more room and speed to supply the outer settlements. 
   <br>&emsp;In this outer settlement, the vessel landed near the 45 latitidue north. The contintenets were split down the middle with some central isalnding, with water covering the rest of the surface. From our surveying, the sun was nearly 2 billion years old, and the planet not much younger. By that,  the crust had solidifed, housed water in a similar way to earth, but held very litle life. As it happened, there was not enough nitrogen to permitt any microbial growth -or sustained at that. As for each settlement, there was a massive air ventialor, that would output the needed elements in order for the settlers to breath. Through the centuries prior to their leave, an understanding grew that air could be better incorporated if the body's health was of a robust state. By that, certain supplements were constructed to allow this on a basic level. This not only allowed the residents to accliitze to the atmospher at hand, but give more leaway for their refrusbihemtnt to take place. By that, the Mason landed on the coast, some 5 miles out. The group had to wear protective gear while they established their means of teraforming, but used the Mason as a housing unit till then. They set up the initial settlement near the water, and some 6 miles south of a westering range of mountains. This belt of peaks ran from the coast into the mainland nearly 10 miles, before dipping into the eastern flats. From the north, a furthe range stretched in a similar way, though it split off into rocky hills going north east. Flowing south from the north of that, ran the river, which split of between the two ranges into a fjord that connected to the sea, while the other branch continued throug through the ravines and cravecas -where the northernmost belt split off into the hils. Ths brnach of the river came south, and bent west to run right at the foot of the nearest range. In a similar way, a smaller river came from the east, flowing along the foot of the easter part of the range, joining with the major brach of the river. A small stream also split from the junction, and ran south, some mile or two east of the main vessel. 
   <br>&emsp;The colonies each had 5 years of food supply. Water was less so, but the means to acquire were also easier than establishing the means for food. Generally, the prime spots for landing were in flat plains. Here, it would be easy to ingrain the land with irrigated soil. Through conversion, soil would be created and infused into the ground. Then felicity of it would take time to settle, and the actual harvest would have to establish. Still, this was not the only mechanism. If there were certain properties to the environemt, then an internal greenhouse system could be made, which itself removed any concern for UV rays and the quality of the planet's ground. It was not bad taste though for a group to ellect to instill new fauna, be it grass or trees. Which, although not always available due to the limits of the enviornemnt, cuold be manufatured with excess resources, or otherwise stablizied amongst the properties that the planet had. On echo2, being a water planet, the content's the atmospher were such that some grass could grow. The soil was the limiting factor, and seeds obviously had to be introduced, but these were managebal tasks. "As water was usually the limiting factor for growing new plants." Generally the land was flat, but did have a slight downward grade to the north. From the spot of the Mason, all the mountains to the north could be seen. Near the stream that ran further south, there was a small rise , creating a bank of sorts, with a similarly flat area as that around it. From here, you could see th sun rise from 100 miles east. And watching the main belt run to the east, the great horn could be seen. Whereby the norther hills met the cap of the lower range, and peaked into a mighty edge. One of the wonderfull things about this planet was that due to its relatively small size, the prescence of water and the more or less temperate zone they were in, meant that the rims of the mountians would accumulate snow; which in the morning gave the Horn a great burnt nose. While the clump of moutains straight north, had a medley of mighty peaks, that generally stayed snow covered year round. Be it under the moonlight, as the sun set or rose, the land was vast and pretty. Better yet, there was very litte obstruction. As the land was quite flat -besides that plate further towards the junction- and thus from your front door you could look out and the see the great horn. The land to the south did admittedly dip slightly, and bundled off into rough hills; but in terms of localle, the essentials were that it was flat, arrible, and otherwise garnished with an atmospehre that could direcrly provide or be conferted into mateiral. The mountains north of us were at best a dressing to our survival. "And the southlands, and admittedly those further east, held their own agendas." Though, some of the initiual scans showed an arrid land further south. "As it happened, this was a crystal desert. In the middle, sat a piece of a broken star, weighing so much that it caused the land to sink. Because this happened from outside the normal geology of the land, the crust former around this, causing a myiriad of hills and flats to form. And in this collusion, the heat and presure caused huge crystals to form, portruding out of the ground. Some are said to reach 40ft tall."

<div id="meagerends">
   Generally, the administrtation was an extension of NASA. As the world grew into a more stable modernity, efforts of all sorts begain to sprout. Not only was technology furthered across the board, but in terms of projects to. Africa was cleaned up relatively, as were advances in medicine made that made the world shine. All these changes though came from the culture evening out. As it were, the past has always been in conflict with the divine influence of relgion, and the contrasting civility and its requisites of engineering and governance. The former alawys capped this, for the heart of everyone's neighbor was either principally different, or of something that was but personal; or at any rate, the two same protestants could both be protestants, and accepted eachother as so, but for each there was a lack of worldy matters; and so from a lack of prominence in such civility, there was no communion simply by its lack. In other words, religion caused friction or non-civil priority. The world has been urbanizing though through the latter part of the millenia, and industrializing at that. And just as there is the proletariot-working class, so are their clergy, and religious complexions of civility at that. But the governance is much more judicial in a worldy way, as opposed to being ecclesiastic. The details are not so thin as to be frank, but simply the outcrop of liberty was one where the momentum of conflict from eosn ago, held polticial sway in terms of the century or two to come. And in russia and china for instance, their advents were of dealing with a population and its massiveness, all while maintaing control. There isn't two pieces to put together, one being religion and the other being peace and propersity of nations. They are important elements though. In our future era, the world holds no principle bearing, as religion is but an elective. No government reduces its spending on HIV or any of its factors regarding birth control, despite the contraierty to relgion. By that, simply, the world has become more natural. Only, the lack of religion hasn't been replaced with anything else; which in effect leads to avarice, gluttony, rascability and shame. The information era highlights this, as everyone is worn down by their impulsiveness; which itself is favilitated by the indirect medium (being digital). The merrit of this way though is one of increased mobility and pleasure in work, along with meaning and connection in those efforts, and one's of a liberal kind. As it were, the farce which is old media, was gradually reproached from by the citizens of the world. Who, as one who win's the lottery, had either spent all their winnings, or otherwise been drenched with retched colors by frivolous spending. The elements of sickness and death, family and relations, and our otherwise self regard and happiness, never left; and as one who outgrows their youthfull drinking, as even its comfort and fun begins to flatten as the negativie aspects build up, so was the folly side of modernity removed from: and simply would simply be. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, people sunk into the nature of their world, which wasn't one that held nuclear warheads over their head, nor was an asteroid seen or likely. Climate change became unburdened by faint narratives, and was understood as something which would effect things resonantly; or otherwise concentrate into events comprable to one's alreaady present. The severity would increase in some regards, but for the most part the world would move one. At least we would have that sense, that inefficency of things and local disasters was the consequence. Which nuclear war was seen similarly; as removing any narrative, one realized that not only would a 100 bombs not be dropped, as no one had the desire or belief that such act would bear profit; but so to, in this most extreme case, would the majority of people not be hit, and otherwise work through the post-war world. Another notion is in regards to tech. Firstly, the singularity could not be achieved. Things akin to it would come up, and robotics did not lack any senmblence of uncannyess. But not for some time could a machine ponder: as it only responded in what it knows. Then, regarding transformism, the replication was never an issue, and always held much promise in its course; only, the product of such technology was one of replication, whereby the entity of one's mind was merely remade; but, as a subject or agent, there was merely made a new one. And much time had to go by before such a recreation could even produce a comparable agent. But simply, my mind being reconfigured, was so that the body I was in was removed; which again, changes the mind as it is housed in a new vessel. But the point, and something that was never misunderstood, was that there was a person who had to either die, or stay while their mind was replicated. They did not go; even if there was one making the same thoughts. "It would be as if you took off your arm, gave it to another, then supposed that the experience of that arm would be felt in your own body." In short, there is a fallacy in thinking that reconfiguring your mind, while dissolving what you already had, will create a continuing experience for the patient. Posterity and immortality of sorts was their gain, but only as a child offers, rather than an expereince itself. Secondly, in brieft, despite the minscule experiemns that could re-produce the effects known as lightspeed or space travel (ie. wormholing), no progress was made, or seemd to be eligble -bv virtue of removing our fancy- that one could take an apple, and have it move in such a way while retaining its form. At best, it seems, the meoldy of particles bundled in the appple, would be torn to bits. Again, it was not outside of experiement to transport an electron, or some element of the quantum field. But identifying every electron individullay (in the apple) simply felt outside of the realm of possibility. At the very least, the common course of man was such that refinements were always made. But just as the sun has always been what we rotate around, and the virtue of a telescope can then see so much more, so has everything which man's produced, been one of telocommunications, measuring technqiues, and otherwise civil application and engineering. I'd put it like this. One's vision is no phenomena, as is your heartbeat nothing more than the muscles of your heart pumping blood through your arteries and veins. Your speech is similar. Only, in its case, the vocals and their output from the vocal cords, is normal and clear. Only, the actual sentiemnt of speech and its source, which like all things comes down to the notion of mind. In this though, the edge of natural sensibility was reached, and onnly our limnits of vocabularly held us from identifying the elements of this. Doing so though increasingly, led to a natural view of the world, whereby intervention was removed, and the common ends of rest was ingrained. By that, our boyish and head down view was replaced with the merrits of doubt, suspciion, and inquiry; all perfomred through informal prose. Which is to say, that although assesments were made of an increasingly exact kind, so were their descirpiton, identities and meanings discerend with a more wholesome and robuts mentality. By that, the notion of transporting an object while keeping it so, was reproache from, along with the singularity, machines, asteroids, climate, and war. Things keep going on, and only in small screen narratives do the birds and bees stop singing, and everything is placed on a stage. This is reality though, and as far as its come, so its mass and grandeur experienced over the next thousand days, and so forth. Even if all these things come, the meaning remains that the core elements of our life stay. And, at any rate, just as there are millions of people who die from Diarahhea and Aids, without and common notice, so would a world war amidst the additioanl hells of global warming, keep your compartively better (and tended) view to the scene of yourself and those core elements. Which again, may be striclty subject to these affairs; but to that kid living in south Argentina, where no bombs or conlifct are nearby, so is the street he's on, his shift at work, his meal, arguments and repriece from his mother, and his otherwise principle content, is his bearing, his load. And if its an asteroid, well, we could see it coming decades prior; and when that would happen from now, we would have already been privy to the natural way: whereby the rest we were sentenced to, merely came sooner and through novel means.
</div>
<div id="thegoodlife">
   Let us take for granted the aim of a good life. By that, its quality matters more than any fancy or appeal. In effect, our regard should helm itself under the requisites to see and manifest such an end; for if our sight is on those former whims, so will our rewards be so.
   <br>&emsp;By that, it is fair, that in this world of responsability, that we would seek relief, or wonderment at any rate -as to make our duties more charming and soft. When we look however, at the expense required to meet such cravings, we realize that the purpose of our overall life is drained. You see, if we live in the same native land, in a modest home of constant familiarity, it is our mind and its sharpness which determines the shine of our life. When that vessel slows though, and becomes torpid and lagged, so are we stuck with all that we already know. The weather even runs over us, as without the brightest moon or burning sunset red, all feels the same. And, as I have experieneced at any rate, the property which I lack is where I am drawn; to move, see, rest and be delighted. These are all removed from an overcast, or the otherwise retreat of leisure and industry upon my sullen mind. 
   <br>&emsp;It is understandable then that since our ability to remain astute is not fairly constant, that we become somewhat rooted in the consequent expereinced of dullness. Interestingly though, you can contrast the preferred disposition of temperence and felicity, as to remain somewhat taught and ample, whereby the goods of that come more constant; and of a better kind. While, the diposition that rears its head when our vitality is  less so, is one of relief, comfort, worldiness, and, in a word, experieences, purpose, pleasure and oppertunity, that welcomes itself to you, openly, freely, and through the future at hand. In a word, the goods of this disposition are based on what you recieve, in terms of an experience given; while those products of virtue are one whereby your solidity and strenght bear an experience themselves: via generositoy, contribution, inquiry and care. "You put yourself into one, as you, being the instrument, can afford to, and otherwise hold a constancy to such state which remains ample and true to the reservations which preserve so, and otherwise the unwavering favor of such felicitous treats, as not to be distracted or regrettful towards other intrusions or comforts."
   <br>&emsp;So I think of our ability to travel, and whether or not its worth it to achieve. For one, the task at hand is to procurr to means to do it at all; and these notches are best described as the means to affording airfair and rent. The problem, is that less you have no reason to return to your homeland, then your touring will be brought back to such place; as perhaps you still have family, and lack any stance to ignore them. This is expensive then, for you must pay to return, and then go back out their travelling. And the general issue is not the value of being more mobile, as this gives both comfort and delight to all. Its moreso along the lines of the narrow line of work that makes this eligible. For if I worked as I did here in some different place, so would we still be at a post; which doesn't change the value very much, and at any rate keeps me wishing to go somewhere. The thing, is that if we were free to go on a whim, so would our means to do so have to reflect that. And as it were, the only means to do this is when you can take your buisness with you. One could be a merchant, and otherwise find more means to move around and settle for longer periods. But if you wished to move every few months, then so would there be a pure mobility of your work. I am sure that those of political and mercantile status held this privilage in time's of old, but still, this did not remark their living, but the advent of moving itself. What were talking about is being where we are, having the ability to go when we please, and otherwise settling into our current place with the ease of knwonign that were free to do so. 
   <br>&emsp;Practically though, all the means to achieving this are through some scheme. For one may have a traditionall job, or appraoch at least, but foster so online. Yet, the actual development of this is no short affair. More importantly, one must employ themselves in such affair to earn their reward; and generally, these tasks are of a creative sort, and under scrutiny due to the contract nature. By that, one can not have but a fancied skill, even for those who are frugal in their needs; for their ability and reputation must still be enough, that their means to finding work is reliable, and their performance satisfactory. 
   <br>&emsp;The question then, in both training and demonstration, is how much effort or care do you have for employing yourself? In regards to our actual life, our effort is best employed along liberal ends. But in that, there is less being spent on acquiring privilage and fortune. And it isn't like our lively efforts are all-consuming; but they take up a great deal of time, in overall committment at least. The issue then, is that if we wish to develop and trade, and one which is mobile, that the route to this is one that shoulders our current wish for living. That is fine, and most things can be procurred this way. Yet, the actual use of these skills, and the somewhat principle need for them to receive enough effort as to garner our effective ability and consistency, is one that wares against our otherwise liberal load. On top of this though, is making a living through engagment, whereby you make your own work, and earn satiety through other people's attention. This is a purer road, is it really remarks our genuine submissions. Yet, the road here is more gradual, and does not have as many intiaial promises. Moreover, the rate at which you grow, is limited as your efforts are more sincere and personal. The more they contort to some scheme or trend, so will you have an increased pace; but this is not much different from our concern of laborous committment. As I see it, the benefit of content is that you can use it as a hilt and trajectory to make what you really seek; and in a way, that is all I really need. In effect, if I were truly privilaged, it would be that I had the wonders of the world around, while I made what I wanted. And, as a note, content is not just a purer game; but one where the impetus is of care and importance; for you share, are known, collaborate and see. By that, if I had all the luxury in the world, there still would be no one in my liberal regards, besides me. In that, I would still seek to procurr some color and shine around such efforts, if only to improve them in their own rights. This is a genuine buisness then; and my sincerity to it holds no regard for promise or oppertunity under any sign of worry -or need to justify. What I can say however, is that our attention there brings me away from any lingering intent to develop elsewhere. It is true though, that as I occupy myself with the efforts I wish to have, so is my home the world; and the common course of our life, and its place in all that is native and known, breathes much esteem and courage into drifting that way. For we are engaged, and ready to see what is nearby as something bold and coming ahead. "While our slowness sees life much further, which doesn't welcome things which appear similar." 
   <br>&emsp;And so, I have not the means or intention to foster an income that would let me travel the world. Nor am I trying to become famous, a savior, a blessing. We live in a world which is run by civility and governance. And all of this is demonstrated through members and their central nodes. Time ticks one and we too breathe our way; but there is not much which is pertruding that many are not attempting to put back in. And otherwise, our idle aims and whims are merely from that. Or better put, in our good moments we seek the use of them in conjurous ways, in our bad moments. But the latter is not good marker; nor is it a limit to the former; as those are but in need of their own committment, and in a flatter world as your better nature projects. Theres no glamor and glee but in those who are outside themselves. And all I truly seek is what nestles inside me. The knowledge of this is weird though; for I know this, see it, ease from it. Yet, in the times when we are shrunk and distant, so is that outer world the object of my regard. Yet I know theres nothing there, as it is only but an anxious description. What I would say, is that your consistency to felicity and her goods, bring you out into the real world; and that although it is not for such brawn and explorative ways, so is the sun there, with all her color, and the general peace and prosperity around; of which you are part of. And theres not much more than that.

<div id="holdingon">
   I find that the mass of the world, with all its divisions keeps me from feeling small and overwhelmed. For one, considering the breadth of things, it is not fair for me to assume what actually happens. Not only is the movement of things in one area unknown to any sure degree, but those even further off are more foreign in our particular understanding. Of course we have more sensibility to our native land; and by that, we could extend that frame onto other points of happening. However, the general rules of outside our own front door are not so sharply knonw. And so, although I have good sense about how the world is besides me, so is their little firmness in how I equate that to other localles. And, at any rate, as the norms of those localles differ, so is our reference bare, as to make any comparison.
   <br>&emsp;What I see, is that we are tired. And by that there is a haste to go out and find something; be it politically, literally, pleasurablly, or of integrity: each amidst the world. Yet, that last matter seems the most peculiar. For surley, if I were true and stout, so would our glimmer shine, increasingly. Yet, as an object, this seems false; as the means for such extension is in the procurrment of our bloom, our sprouting. That we would reach something feels more like a natural consequence. Admittedly, when we are slow and idle, our need to clarify the results of those outputs seems more pressing. In a way, our tender pace takes care of it self; incorporating the time behind us, settling into the present, and grasping the future with a happy hand. In that, I need no confirmation: for I easily, and merely see more. By that, there's not much to say.
   <br>&emsp;What I must mention though, is that our actions are almost truly false, when their outcomes are not of a sustaining sort. Because, evidently, I find myself in such a grinding state, whereby the past seems more choppy and in need of remedy, while the present seems both to eager to proceed (and find excitment), and otherwise drip apathetcially into a silent passivity (and all the acompanying indulgence). These generally pair together, and the future is then angled under our stature of angst. Hereby, we act as though our place is one of these dragging and flappy times. In contrast, our good state is one which carries itself, and asks little for what will come, or regrets whats been. While, this state of drudgery, is consistent in a similar way; nor is it lacking our developed ability and regard as to resolve based on the paces and direction so far reached. Only, the composure which we refeence and seem to expect, or at least respect, and thus adhere to and prolong, is within that rigid complexion. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, I tend to notice when this state is whithering, away at least into one of firmer footing. And by that, I see how the future, in partciular, has more rest and solidity in its hopes and cares. Consewuently, I tend to let myself float into that lighter composure, and let our resolve match the tenure of such ends (or their own composure at least). I mention this, because there is a moment when this transition occurs, that I feel a mixture of anticipation and exicmtent for the future ahead, but based on less frigid and hasty means. This is important, for when we are in fact settled into those riper ways, we tend to worry little about the place of our ends, and instead accomadoate our approach under the indifference and ease which such state elicits. Only, I also notice that as the minor steps of this state linger into one's which are a bit to rocky or tense, so do I feel a certain lack of constance, as to meagerly return to that more lushfull pace; where instead, we tend to see a future remedy or affair as a relief, or concern rather, of these slight moments of rigidity: yet in that, theres none. And, as it happens, the resolve of our way seems in conflict; for on one hand, we are naturally stated for a vibrant and livley pace; but in that, there is little which the contrary path of sunkeness and its wish for relief and certainty can find. And my point, is that since this latter path is not one of worth or favor, and that in our preferred way -and our judgement of it being resounding- that there is a consistently evident slip, or tear at least, towards that contrary place of gratuity, so am I keen and accepting to belive that our course along those finer actions, is hollow. At least, somewhat, when you consider that the highest merrit of it, holds no firm standing. Which is, that the good I see and expereince, regularly even, holds little constancy; or over the long term that is. Starting again comes from our general dispostion to this. But so is are the mistakes initially a sign of our path lacking something to begin. At least, if our state of goodness were consistent, this I would judge more favorably, or at least deem unscruitbaly, when comapred to such a state happening only often. If it is so good and favorable, why not wish for and work to achieve it all the time? Naturally, and fairly, there may be limits as you'd expect. Yet, what I suspect, and otherwise doubt beyond this complacency to perfecton, is that what is in fact common and achievable, is past our mere point of regularity.
   <br>&emsp;I presume, that if you were living well, that whatever that meant, would in fact become more ripe in substance, easier to acquire, and continue with more range and consistency. We may in fact always notice room for improvmenet; but it is that evident slip which I am concerned about. For me, I see how a lack of overall purpose and entire knowledge sparks such tears. For, as I submitt, the misteps here are not due to the natural limits of what is otherwise perfect, but rather the apathetic and or complacent allowances, based on our assessment of haviing already done enough, or seeing nothing else to do. In that, a state of idlness occures, and otherwise stillness of life and all other things. This can refer to our dispostion being to pressed to goodness, but in fact holds lingering passions and fears; and as such reveals these when your better actions are completed. "Whereby those poor roots and proclivities hinder your rest." I notice this at least.
</div>
<div id="naturesway">
   So I have this notion, and admittedly it feels ultimate. Though I must reserve myself from expecting a whole definition, for the element in question is not yet identified; and as it were, before my thoughts of such thing, I would prefer an actual description -as to have more meat around the bone.
   <br>&emsp;Simply, the world is good; and this is not so because I can see it, or have the charm to do so. Rather, all things are fair, be it in laws, punishment, violence or calamity. Obviously these are suffocating, and cause such negativie symptoms -be it fear or literal dismemberment. But this is the nature of things bending merely in an awkward way. As it were, the end of our life holds no vicious claim: and by those accounts I rest our limited understanding of how negativity can in fact be, while the nature of things in general remains good. That is, with those mucky edges, so is their end a good one. 
   <br>&emsp;What I notice then, is that virtue is a sort of brace, as to remain appropriate to nature, be it in her postive sides, or enduring her harsher complexion. Which, in short, marks the favorable spin of all this, for principally our ends are good, nor are those which are bad in experience, beyond our capacities to treat. For if were being honest, the infringments of our pleasure and content are really from harsh jurisdiction; which itself is not but momentary for an average member of the realm. Be it in ruthless injury, or simple inconvencience, the principle of life affords us no basis concession to any moment of such negativity; nor, in our time proceeding are we lacking any facultie to deal with it -in fortitude and habitation.
   <br>&emsp;Personally, I see a line, of which the highest model reflects -of a person that is. I cannot fully define it as said, for it needs further description. So, on that, I can convey this simply by saying that if you are well enough, then to the nature of things you will see. By your clarity of things, the principle good remains, all while the liberties of being a citizen are present. Again, harsh treatment or false sentences can occur, nor is their an abscence of civil altercations. But these are like gusts of wind, cracks in the road, the tempests of nature scoarching the lands around. Again, as our discipline, understanding and strenght are overcome, we are but blinded to any otherwise scenic reality; which is to say, that even if our senses are removed, it is but so for a moment; for if it is death your given, so is there nothing but the nature of things; or, if it is an infliction of pain, so do you return to an otherwise painless expanse of reality; and if that infliction was of a disabling kind, so are we formidiable and astute enough to adjust and surpass such shortcoming. 
   <br>&emsp;Simply, we are then acquited from any permanent or continous perril. As, to quote Montainge, "if something is so bad that it brings the former, then the fairness of nature and peace are there; while, the less then fatal prescence of the latter, however severe, holds no overly significant effect; for even if the employment of such severity had you beleiving otherwise, so would reality accomodate you afterwards -which again, in following an actual burn for instance, holds room and time for the provident properties of fortitude and habitability, which is to say that the punishment is gone when the employment of it is over, and you may bear any lingering negativity."
   <br>&emsp;As in all things, it is hard to start from nothing when so little is actually known. It is better to say, that in our own abundance of writing, that this was so due to there being a subject or experience which I was in motion with, and could forgo the furthest extremities to write with. As it were, in these purely ground up remarks, there is a need for a complete picture. For, as it were, the nature of things is truly fine; but that is generally so for the common postivity of it holds me in such according strides, that our remark about negativity is but of a considered one; while now, it seems to be a neccessary portion -because were starting from further back.
   <br>&emsp;Yet, in that, I see the possibility. This is perhaps due to the principal good in death, and how pain is otherwise a deliverence for that, or a temporary experience before the non-injurous side of life is returned to. And, from what I mentioned, the lingering effects of pain have a soft home within our formative faculties. 
   <br>&emsp;By that though, I must blossom these sentiments with mentiones of other properties, as to remark the bracing towards the positive ends of life. By that, the back side of virtue seems to be that which deals with pain. While the front side acclimitzes us to nature's finer complexions. As it were then, I would define life as follows, in that it has a neccessarily positive end, and otherwise holds moments of positivity or pain. Beyond pain, there is discomfort and other lingering negativities: our fortitude and temperance can provide. While, times which are idle or otherwise anxiety enducing, so can our composure and briskness fair. And as I personally see it, life is split heavily onto that positive end; at least in our liberal democracies of the modern age, we are more privy to mere moments of pain, stretches of neccessary effort and toil; and otherwise, are subject to a world of wonder and time of rest and delight -and all the alignments such goods require. Now, in older times, when despots reigned, so were the moments of pain more sever in some instances; and perhaps overall the toil required of man was more brittle and prolonged; and at any rate, the lingering effects of real severity, was in fact harsher and longer. Still, the scale of life remains, and its altered balances merely alters the strain on our same faculties. And, as the worst of pains still sees us return to good, so is there a similar limit of generally worse times; for even slaves are privy to the goodness of death, nor lacking any of the surrounding positivity to their confined position. I will speak more about various instances following our definintion, but generally the model is but re-angled, regardless of case. So our definition remains fair in  being non specific.
</div>
<div id="4sides">
   Our model has four elements. One, is pain, which is to say that punishment, civil allturcations, accidents or misfortune smear your day; two, is toil, as in the work of a farmer, the patience of a parent, or the general effort required to meet our neccessities; three regards benefits, which generally are of frivilous kinds, in that they are but fancied and unimpactful, or novel, in that their good is only temporary; these can come in various forms, but generally, we look at the value of things to determine their benefit, rather than seeing something such as a larger home as greatly beneficial, when in fact its benefits are equally novel, only perhaps in larger amounts; then four, is activity, which regards our moving delights and pleasure, and in esscence hankers itself on our skill and prudence in such efforts and their execution, along with our actual piety to such briskfull and living ends, whereby the fear of pain, concern of toil and shame of missing benefits fails at tarnishing your content and joy in leisure, industry and care; that is all to say, that our dispostion of activity is equally born of excess as benefit, but more felicitious and mature in its erection and dispostion, while benefits generally remark youthfull whims, grown up confidence, and otherwise futile remedies and comforts of those lower elements of pain and toil.
</div>
<div id="theeasethatsbeen">
   The most curious thing about life is in terms of its balance between positive and negitive. For, generally, all ends up the same, so even the most pitched negativity holds no lasting reign. But still, even the most positvely bent world still needs an employment of intelligence; as it were, if the pain and toil of the world were so sparse and uncommon, that benefits even held no regard, then so would the means for identifiyng positive things, amending to them and enjoying them, require their own methods and itinerary. As I see it, our nature is one, in a bodily sense at least, and thus one which is subject to the roots of pain, whereby we've come from times which were not so privy to absolute positivity. And considering how modernity is really a regulation of civility and manners as to avoid unnecessary pain and toil, so is the regulation of leisure, industry and care a novel development. For we have had no tradition or support in prioritizing such things. Fundementally, there is no excuse in the strictest sense, for even those who farmed in ancient Babylon, could still employ their speculative sense; as they would use fortidue to endure the toil of their employments, so could they demonstrate virtue in such a way as to reproach from spending their excess' on benefits, but activity instead. And you might say, "activity, what are you talking about; this is a farmer were talking about 4000 years ago, what activity do you mean?" And my simple reply, is that although they may be subject to monarchs, and tyrants at that, and although there efficiency in meeting their needs is still one rooted in toil, that any spare moment or pace, need not be spent on acquiring more than their toil was already meant for, nor are they in lack of things to invovle themselves in, despite their ancient ways; for the stars were present for those in the stone age, nor was self regard and inquiry an  inaccessible thing; and even if expressing such curisoitiyes was deemed sacrilege, so could the common devotion to God be done through the gratitude of the beauties and delights sprung around the farmland. "Be it the wind blowing through the grass, the snow capped moutntain far about, or the moon lightihg our night, so is there always present for even the basest person to engage in." Benefits employ them otherwise, while toil and pain are but limits on our content; while the gaze onto the world and her positive shades, is for those with such content, and steadily at that. But these are the annals of man. As agriculture came from reason and skill, and the laws, commerce and technology that had room to follow, so have our minds become free as tigers and starvation ceded their consistency. Not to mention that the heart of civilized men is that of religion; which is to say that beyond these pastural ways, that the stability within that bore us the concern and amends towards our time after life. Yet, in that, also came inquiry, amongst other things. And to my point, so would the paces of life which accomdated, or facilitated at least, those inquisitive and or devoted ends, also foster the common and accessible means to appreciate the stars: or at least reflect on the libertys of such a life that bore the time and ease to do so.
   <br>&emsp;My point then, is that although the civilized world has several thousand years of history, and that its ultimate product is one of freedom, but initial, so am I unconvinced that in those ancient times that were was any fundementall limit regarding the thing which is wortwhile in the freedom's  we have now. There is admittedly less toil, nor risk of pain as in those times. But in regards to activity, depsite the current means of its breadth (and oppertunity), the orientation still remains. And personally, I see the lack of discourse and enlightenment which caused the world to reach the point of freedom that is has now, as being so due to lacking what the freedom now  given requires, in that we are in fact proper to employ for positivity. Not to get sidetracked, but considering what led to society, and how the unfounded fruits of those primitive ways burrowed their way into the heart of those ancient, I can only say that the freedom we had to birth such proclivitie was a remark of our freedom being used wrong. For it is in inquiry and grace that we should proceed if liberty has given us such a pace; yet, in those primitive and ancient ways, the fear of things bent our ends as so; for we could not relish the stars and wonder; instead, the innate fear of pain had us contort the meaning of such findings into something consequential; and such a mistake marks the story of society so far. That is all conjectural for sure; but I just don't see any strong reason to feel so privilaged in our current time; when in fact, their is but an appreciated breadth in which our right amends can proceed; only, in comparison to those odler ways, I believe that the means to do the rihgt thing then, merely lacked the space, but not any absolute ability. By that, I make the main critique of society, in that it foolishy reduced the means to act approprtialye to the freedom they had. It is true that their best means would not match our own; but so would the sharpest and finest paces be best in any assortment of ways. Now, we are evidently open to be, and without effective hassle. Yet the problem remains, so much as the quality of our life is concerned; which is that we surpass any unfounded fear of pain and toil; and helm ourselves otherwise to look past novel benefits, and employ ourselves towards those ends which treat us with more sincere prospeties, ie, joy, rest, felicity, regularity, sense, solidarity.
</div>
<div id="injurouspath">
   It seems, what we are to talk about, is how the world is in fact bent regarding its preferred vs negitive ends. Simply, pain is administered through violence or accidents. At least, we can say that for the former, that corporal punishment is excuted or punished, theres a civil alltercation (e.g, robbery or assault), or giving birth (as this is a sort of violence). Accidents on the other hand are less vile and begrieving, for by their nature they simply happen. Their effect can be mitigated somewhat, but the cause is almost certaintly out of your control. Calamities are like this, in that no malice is employed during a storm or forest fire; rather the breeze simply went our way. Trips and falls are similar, in that no one is to blame, except the mismatch of your feet and the ground. Then, there is vehicular accidents, whereby the otherwise normal and welcomed affair of driving or operating something, become's injurous. Even if negligence is invovled, its still an accident.
   <br>&emsp;An interesting point is that when we compare the modern world to that of old, we can see how the oitmnets for pain are more accessible, all while less pain is administered. As it were, despot governments were more common in the past; and as such, baseless sentences and harsher punishments were employed. In comparsion, our liberal states are such that even those who are plainly guilty, still recieve custom and rights, as a citizen and litigant. Moreover, it is more likely that their crime will receive them more humane punishments. Moreover, if in an older time someone was mutilated as a punishment, I suspect that their use of such disability was harder than it would be in the present; nor would there be as many finacial possibilites for someone in those ages to return to, or make us of in there altered state. The point, is that in a first world democracy, the courts are administered, as are their punishments less barborous. And with medicicines, surgery, govermental aid, and the otherwise warmth and security of the most basic of homes, so do these times feel less severe, and otherwise incorporating and softening of any pain in hand. 
   <br>&emsp;As a quick note, the deployment of soldiers, or persectuors in the case of a pogrom (for instance) seems to me more fitting in the violent side of things, as opposed to an accident. For, if I rob someone and attack them simultaneously with a knife, this is a similar act as that of a soldier. In that, the risk of war is both in the might of artillery, and cavalry to some extent, along with the threat of being bludgeoned, slashed, pierced or beaten. Regarding persecutions, the fighting is generally similar, but in the case of submission, pilliaring or exile, so are these more toilsome, or unfortunate at any rate; and again, not only does the modern world behave differently, but there is more room and means for those subject to such pain and misfortune to deal with it.
   <br>&emsp;Overall, amongst toil, benefit and ease, there lies pain as a sheathe, in that she is possible or likely due to circumstance. Yet, by nature, each person is likely at risk of a moment, and infrequently -as the causes of pain are themselves severe, and thus less common, as fatality either occurs, or the chance fails to again strike. I find this an important fact, or element of our inquiry. For in truth, it seems that toil is the heart of human condition, and what we are to surpass in our liberated ways. Pain is always present, as accidents always happen, as do people naturally give birht, get sick, make mistakes etc. Nor is there a void of crime, or circumstances where people must fight and defend; or at any rate, the possibility of pain can be present, less fear of those judging is disposed too -which itself is a bit of toil born of a looming threat. But consider a town, its central authority, police, servicemen, and the complex of citizenry, in the farmers, maidens, craftmen, merchants and children, and ask yourself how many are in fact robbed, and repeatedly? Or, how many are attacked, or subject to violence outside the chance happening of crime or circumstance of war? And how despotic is the realm around, when the person is not a ptolemic, a rebel, a miscreiant? How many farmers are at such a risk as to merely sow and provide? Compliancy may be required, as in the Soviet Union, and misfortune may arise; but the sentences of pain and destrcution born out by those harsh litigators, seems not so random and saturating; perhaps unreasonable and thus hard to oblige, but still due to some policiy or law, which one can choose to amend. I just wonder if some agrarian community in Ancient Egypt held such fatal ends for the farmers and worksnen, commonly. Surely there is a pernicous elemnt of heresy and maligment of authorities to those out of line; but less these things were there, would a person not be fine? And accidents are accidents indeed, but not required. There is indeed a fallacy that says that becuause something possible or likely has not happened yet, that as time goes it only becomes moresoe; yet this is poor thinking. It is very possible that a large amount of worksmen failed to succumb to severe injury; and that even if they did, that such an instance (or one like it) never happened again. Its true that our painting must account for the inevitable illness' and loss that life holds; but were more or less talking about the paces of our life. As the good which we'd otherwise see is found there. 
   <br>&emsp;And in short, if one lives in an overly litigous time, so is that period one where people are wise to be afraid, and sucumb to the threats of that by being appropriately placed. Or, if the times are more fairly administered, so is one more fair to be open and at ease in their wisdom: but ought wisdom ever wain? Surely such times and their according localles may faciliate more crime and or fighting; but so are these strands of pain which must squirm their way through the whole of our days, or life even. It is quite easy for someone to walk down the main road, and avoid the routes of war. I only mean to say then, that by chance or a tight ministry, one is otherwise fine and subject to the toils of their condition. Which is to say, that one is in fact fine and free, stabily, despite the effort required. Personally, I would describe liberty, as one where no such toil exists; which is not to say that there is no condition, or effort required, but that as a worker the effect is not so burly or weighing as to produce a negitive effect. "In that, the good of doing things in general, descirbes the paces of your neccessary efforts." And while pain removes us from tbe pace's of life, so is that line one which bears us the ground to be; which is itself the point of society. But, I would say, that when the ability to stand is past regard, then you are able to see; and as the trouble in performance loses its burden and discouragment, so are you free to employ yourself liberally. At this point, we reach that predicament, as to whether our excess' are better spent of benefits or activity. But per the model at least, we can say firmly that where those excess' come from is in our dealing with our condition beyond the point of toil. And that such toil, as a mark of our condition, remains as a reality of meeting our condition; yet such demonstration bears us our life to exist as so. And pain, is but a chance reality surrounding this; or otherwise, a perncious and or tricky confinment that one must further work to adhere, in states of authority where governnace is so much employed -e.g, the fascits who beleived that secrecy ought be banned for instance, but for the goal of the state's prosperity.
</div>
<div id="hurtandtoil">
   So our model is one where pain sits beneath toil. The issue, simply, is that what is the likelihood of someone being subject to litany and or cruelty, if they in fact follow the law? It is possible that being so obediant runs against their principle; or that in the case of the Soviets who demanded that the harvests be sent in, which due to little coming back put the producer at risk; but so, if they actually obliged and sent the food in, would they be ok. And at that, in the most pernicous of times, if someone fibbed to the authorities regarding a man, and they were keen to be overly scrupulous, so could that man oblige. Perhaps he would still be sentenced and or hurt; but if he obliged, offered his admission and frnakly confessed his time and ways, ought he in the ideal scenario be seen as innocent, or at least be penalized without any misapprehension of doing something worse? Perhaps being supposedly wrong is a crime; but isn't actually being wrong more damning? These are pepculiar aspects, for the law is not one of obediance or not, but awkward judgements of a persecuting kind. Which itself, I'd say, calls on no lesser amount of obediance; but is perhaps inconveniant. 
   <br>&emsp;I'm just thinking within your ordinary tyranny, whether contorting those laws would still see the proper subjects punished. This is anecdotal, as I suspect that the only time when such alignment to the laws failed to prevent punishemtn, is from the malicious whims of those in charge. Which is not to say that even the most litigous auhtorities weren't vicious; but that there malice came about through litiny, as opposed to fancy and whims. 
   <br>&emsp;As we'ved stated, crime is but a chance thing. For in some people's case, a basic mugging is the worst they've ever experienced, or a tavern brawl. Statistically, the majority of people don't experience any severe criminal activity. And in terms of those who do, so is the prevalence for this variable in terms of the scenario. Its a seperate metric, but for compariosn sake you can attest to the homicide rate during the Renassaince, which was at about 500 per million, but then quickly dropped down to 100: averaging out at about 50 in the modern day. Civil crimes such as robbery, assault and things of the less fatal sort, are more than not likely to be more pervasisve, as their natures are not so severe; but so is it likely that a minor percentage of people are subject to these; at least, only a select amount of people demonstrate themselves in that way. At least to any severe extent; as pickpocketers are not the bane of humanity; or at least the bearers of pain. 
   <br>&emsp;Regarding pain in general, it seems that crime is but a chance, and not neccessarily eventual. Accidents are as such, and seem to be worth no pessimissm, but understanding -for their ministry is done without intent, and require thus only our fortitude, and no recompense of fear (from an otherwise assailent). Then, theres the law, and its breadth of leniency and fairness. For one may be asked little and threathed with as much; or they may live in equally fair times, but with the most sever of penalities upon infringements. Times may otherwise be horrid and dreadfull, and likely threatening as the latter, but fairly. While, the worst scenario is where life is retched, and the punishments are given out on whims. "Which causes the desecration to be filled with angst, as beyond the misfortune, theres a storm of litiny and arrest."
   <br>&emsp;It seems that toil is not a symtom of violence or accidents, as these describe moments of injury and pain. Their effects may linger, and as such cause toil, but the act of being punished or hurt is itself beyond experience: as if the duration of pain consumes you, and flattens your ability to be. Toil on the other hand is about your existence being worn out, dragged, heavy and down. What I would say, is that if your in this state, then your not in pain. For none who are tied at the stake expereince weariness or despair during the actual incineration. In a way, pain is the expereince of removal, as if your being broken and dismantled. While toil occures while your body is solid and in place, but is weighed upon: like its sinking. My point, is that if you are in the paces of that latter, then you are privy to the abscence of pain. And by that, as we consider what our toil is reminsicent of, then the survival which it is neccesarily banked on suggests that you are at least achieving that somewhat so. Your ultimate failure may produce pain; as starving may eventually treat you to something akin to being unable to breathe. But so much as your steps are forward, they are reaching a point of stability. And, in addition, as that stability comes easier and with less given by you, then you beging to thrive, and in effect can afford the steps of excess -and their ends of benefit or activity. 
   <br>&emsp;But I must return to this seperation from pain and toil. For one may live in the harshest of socieites, with knifes hovering over their head. So long though as they haven't entered your skull, then you are otherwise doing what your neccesity dictates. And, to be fair, nearly all states have the aim of prosperity; they simply may be ignorant, complacent or mistaken about how to achieve this. But suggesting that bullys and boys run the government, is a fairly bland remark. The point though, is that as your toil is received, then so is your path to life in progress. Now this pesky detail of obediance comes into question. For the toil required may in fact not be sufficeint for what you need; and the hellish rules surrounding you may in fact make such shortcomings intolerable. But so long as you obide by those rules, are you not free to toil? Revolutions and critique, at one's own expense even, seem to come when such freedoms are not enough, be it from handicapping rules or simple falts of the workers means. But can't you see then, that the risk of revolt seems to be past the concern of violence and pain; as those invovled have deemed such a threat as less worrying than remaining in their current place. And so less one deems that the rules must be changed, be it out of reckless frustration or serious concern, so is one free to be in the bounds of those rules, and toil away. At that point, lets say, that they can just provide enough food for their familiy to survive, may they not accept this? Despite the possibility of a better government and state, the risk of fighting for that may lack enough provocation, if in fact their needs are met. If the rules tighten, or become less effective, and one can no longer toil enough to survive, then their life is already forfeit, and they risk the improvment born through revolt. But if their life is not under threat, fundementally, then where is the fear of pain? I'd say it is the chance's of crime or accidents. Or, otherwise, if one's needs are not enough to satisfy them, then the risk of revolt may have enough provokation. In that I won't pass judgement. But whereas a man who cannot feed his family in his best of ways, fairly attempts to solve this; while somone who had those needs met, but sought more -which is itself holds a broad range of elements, of gluttounous and or fair qualitities- so would I desrcibe this as not being overly frugal. Oddly though, Montesquie suggests that frugality, and virtue in general, is the spring of democracy, as everyone loves their society, and tempers their place within it as to permitt equality amongst all memebers. Comparing this to a tyrannt state, where one is in the best of times able to survive off the minimum amount of requied bread, says to me that if frugality were present there, then so would the state appear democatic, or functioning at least. "For my needs are met, and in that I am fine to live as the state pleases. If the former is no longer so, than my obligation to the latter loses my regard; for in the first case, I am only pleased to do as they harshly demand, so long as what I need is in place." Democracy's then and their inherint virtue, seem to offer more than the meagerly amount of required bread -and all this in rubble and rain. But instead, propser evenly and prominently, whereby services, goods, novelty and promise are available. It is perhpas democarcies shortcoming when those invovled bank themseves to much on those accessory goods, and fail to remain virtuous and temperate to the core spring of its provision. But that is all for now.

<div id="pointofcomparison">
   "Comparison is the thief of joy," says a man, and my reply is "sure, absolutely: but by which scale ought my action's be judged by? Obvivously the sentiment is that someone elses apparent happiness ought not be the gage by which yours is deemed. Yet, what determines your actual happinees? Or, is that even the object in question?"
   <br>&emsp;For me, theres this lack, but of a natural sort. For we are not Kings, nor are we idols and merchants. And the question I think that centeres into the whole our regard, is why those are not the right objects. At least, when we consider what is the proper goal, we can see that those other ones are inferior.
   <br>&emsp;In our early days we measured this by joy and rest. And as this removed uneccessary ambition and future regard, so did the truth of the world bare upon us. By that, we settled on a natural limit; at least by todays accounts, we simply have reproach, as we better define what it even is that were unsure of. From this, we developed the notion of qualities, which simply were meant as scales for judging what the best experience would by. In that, we supposed that the substance of something ought be wholesome and pure, accessible and consistent. A question still lingered though, as if we had to justify why these were proper, and that ceratin actions would fit. In response, we developed the notion of ostentation and that of subjects, whereby the former remarked the view of our world which was in fact incomplete, yet able to be addressed as it 'ostensibly was'; while the elements of that limited view, could be addressed as they effectively seemed. The classic example of this was red and blue, and that for instance if we were watching a video game, then we'd know that the colors were but rearrangments of the inner parts -which were not of red and blue themselves. But, as subjects, we could still address them as so, in how they were ostensively.
   <br>&emsp;THe problem I am now faced with, is despite our upward current, we are not privy to any platform or ground: less we make it ourselves. It is fine to float, and is in someways neccessary, and reflective at least of what is ultimatley important. But, ostensively, we are still drawn, by the moon and sun, the taste of grain and citrus; nor are we absent from toil, and otherwise unprivy to the committment and graces of friendship and community. As a man in what we effectively are, so are there things to do. Only, the best of me, where I shine brightest and expereince the remedy from fear, is in leisure, industry and care, which is mightily hard to define, oblige and share. For, the crux of a man's life is as follows. If he were suffocating, by sense or neccessary movment he'd gasp; and per our intelligence and its development through society, so is our address of sustainability and stability banked on our committments to the system which supports us. And, a man in some sense ought to know what that system means; for their sympathy may be poorly bent; and otherwise, there thoughts may be incomplete and accordingly lack direction as to what they (as a member) are right to do. For you see, throughout all of modernity we have had this tricky question: what do I do with my excess. For just as I feel awry at the removal from the system, and thus pleased and safe when we are appropriately set as to receive what we need, so are also keen the more complimentary pleasures and interests. The feeling of being out of line as to receive those is not so essential or damming, but one which can make us feel begrudging, poor in comparison, left out, frustrated at other's for not being out of line. The treatment of liberty though come's into play, as our theory of ostentation effectively removes any merrit of thinking that nature is intrudable and that our life is judged for the sake of some eternal expereince; nor are we subject to miserable privilage and fortune, at the thought that others are rampantly worse off, when in fact their destiny is to nothing, and otherwise momentary in its pain. "And man ought to really know what likely causes that; as this gives a more solid, yet precise standing for his virtue and sensibility to wrap around; whereby the employment of fortitude against any of pains lingering removes the fear of it happening at all."

<div id="modeofconquest">
   So I've got a few initial remarks. Simply, the confederacy of the world seems the best modern advent. It is true that the result of this took a worldly toil; but even then, those who spent their lives did so in order for the confederacy's to ban together, into unions (or leagues). By that, there are but a select few nations which operate independantly -notably Russia and China. By these though, their greatest threat is conquest; which in our times seems quite tilted in our favor. Even then, we can respect their aim of preservation; and otherwise criticize alterior motives. At least we can regard the spring of such motives as despotic. 
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, a given conquest may result in the government of the victor acquiring those defeated, all while continuing the laws and customs as they were; or they may change those, or at any rate dismantle the society. To quote Montesquei, "if they proceed further to destroy the people, then they surely must be despots; as the removal of subjects does not neccessitate the removal of man."
   <br>&emsp;On the front end, in our modern excess, there is a fine notion of happiness, in that we'd work from our freedoms as to reach for things far and positive. Only, success still seems part of our tradition, and by that we seem to occupy our liberties on acquiring more, for benefits at least. But I would say that this is not par for the course of happiness: which I would mark as the dearest value. 
   <br>&emsp;Simply, my own happiness is most important, for that of others, our own success and what others can also earn, is born from it. In a way, this is the natural course of things, for others satisfaction with me, and my offer, is what earns me success. And from there, if I have enough success then I may form a company, whereby the happiness of others is further accomadted (in extent and amount); and the neccessary company required bears success to those now invovled. But this all stems from your own happiness. Which, I would say brings more forward the closer you are to it. For, if you are mistaken in your goals that success is most important, then your value offered for that wont be as much if the product is insincere and contrived. For one, theres less consistency in that than there is in something that really pleases you. Nor, is there any dear care from others when the contrivance of your product offers only basic values. "It is the love and care from a baker that makes the best cookies." As it were, a major company may have started with something less loving -as remarked their bend towards success. In that, many may appreicate the product, as the assembly by the company may afford such extent. But I think, in principle, that brand name cookies will never earn any individual memebrs favor as much as they would have for their mother's home made oaties, or that from a lil bakery. In contrast to those pure and scrumptous, is those baser and conveniant. 
   <br>&emsp;You may be saying then, "well of course they'll be happier, as the product is more sublime: but the profit of the company (in all their contrivance) will be more." In that I agree; yet I raise the question of our own values, and whether it is success we seek, or happiness. One may lead to the other, but at the very least, we can say that one is the object -while the other is merely a facilitator. Imagine though, if I had all the money in the world, and decided that the best use of it was purchasing the right equipment: what about the laboroers? Better yet, even if skill was paired within the operations, would character not determine how success was used. For, as its common, our actual employments tend to mold what it is we desire; be it of relief or clarity. For in our labors, we plan and develop as to reach a further point of success, or otherwise soften our wears with liqors and treats. Is that happiness? 
   <br>&emsp;The first rule of philosophy, as pertains to man at least, is that happiness is not measured in contentment, but felicitous activity. And as the objects of success hold require tools and character, so does happiness hold its own. It is not so that the ends of buisness and infamy are happiness; instead, happiness is the end of the activities which procurr it. And while pleasure, comfort and significnace do bear a fair reward, the actual elements which bear these are mixed between frivolity or novelty. While the efforts of leisure, industry and care, reward one which ends which are constant, merry, and pure. 
</div>
<div id="settlingpath">
   I don't know what I want. For starters, there's this peculiar focus I have on things of a liberal sort. I refer to that, in the sense that things of a stabilizing or pleasing sort, earn little regard; perhaps because I already have so much, inheriently. And so those things which draw my liberated mind, hold me accountable; despite the fact that they always slip away; for their place is only there when I am. While those elements of comfort and mystery, are more like promises, in which we are right to show up -and thus work towards. 
   <br>&emsp;This is where I struggle. For our efforts don't bring out the latter; and although our time is spent making towards the former, so is the natural inconsistency of that, a drag. For there is so little which my effort seems worthwhile to address besides this. Yet, in that we are our own limit; in that we shed unneccessary expectations from those efforts of leisure and industry; and that when it comes to our consistency, that we would be at least clear on the realities of the alternative, and equally for our own. In that, I see no need to travel, as the time there is either less rewarding than the requirment can offer; or at least the narrow domain of what is actually a beneficiary and or associate to those things of the ripest sort (while travel is more sought from idleness), makes such efforts a detraction from those so dear. Better yet, the elements of the right life, generally afford us the occupation and rest to proceed, without any grievences of our lack of oppertunity; for we see not, for we are invovled; nor do those other impressiosn unsettle us, for we are already moving and satisified. And, at any rate, if I look at our future, and regard it as open to move and be, and perhaps apply ourselves to that, I still don't think that such a life -and its mercantile requirment- is conducive to the goods of a good life. How can you foster relationships or community by moving constantly? Even if your family was gone, so would your interest to move, reflect a life which was solely your own. Yet, in that, I see the limit which procurrs such desire, as coming from your current lack of occupation. This isn't absolute, merely a measure by which our contentment and regard should proceed. For we are doing much, and in terms of those true goods, there is room to acquire (or try at least). The future then seems irrelvant and unlimited when it comes to those fleeing and novel fancies.
   <br>&emsp;In a way, this focus we have is only limited by our ability to attest to it. Comparably, in the early portion of the year it was clear that A) we were reserving ourselves from things we desired in the name of success (via our liberty), and that B) we were accordingly put off because we truly were not as happy. While now, having rectified that to a degree, we care less what others want or care for; in fact, they seldom do, but from time to time ask. Its about how well you are; and when you are not, and questioning your life and in some sense trying to change it from a source which does not afford you such kinds of sought change, you then get closed off, for you struggle with sharing how your peculiar life, doesn't fit within the norms. Admittedly, people have little to offer besdies those norms. But we, personalyl, have integrated ourselves more, and thus can rest and proceed, openly. In that, I can see that there are lingering elements, notably regarding travel and work, that reek of a lack of clarity under this happy lense. For it is not the case that our honesty and assessment has been poor; only though when we did not in fact believe it. Now that we are more content, we can describe our actual interest in travel, and otherwise concern ourselves with what it is, what it means, and the route to do so. Which generally removes any doubts of our reproach from fancy -as we are fine and definitie in hwo it is so. Work is not so different, in that you benefit comes soley through mobility -through mercantile ways. Yet, in that, be it in commerce, trades of care, you are left with the unneccessary benefits from the first two, and the long road of the latter. And by that, the truth in our world is where our happyness limits me; for if we were well off enough to say how things really are, and thus what we are good to be, and equally desired by our own, then we could more rightil amend; in that success did not have any pressing need to be our object. Tasks for sure can be done, along with projects and amends. But, seeing how things really are and what they mean, can really iron out the simple path to happiness, and its objects, when amidst that truth, the elements of the each are what I see. And so within our freedom we can be, happy in and of itself: foresmostly, without falty amends: for our qualities are born from truth: and we thus need very little footnotes regarding our supposed intent otherwise.
</div>
<div id="sparkedapproach">
   So, i feel this brace from others close to me, who in their irriation scorn at our inaction. Yet, for the sake of happiness, the world is not so clear. And at any rate, it seems so hard to occupy ourselves for things which aren't for success; and otherwise, be content with what we have, and rest little on what goods of success we'll earn. I am always footnoting and justifying why happiness is alright, or at least how our happy steps will bear promise.
   <br>&emsp;The issue, is that if we are not sincerely happy, then the desire we have will feel worn upon by others scorn. This isn't entirely fair, as our view of goods and fun is generally furnsished upon our well of dear goods; whereupon our slack in their respect sees us wishing for surrounding flavor. Yet, I still feel, or notice at least, that either as a cause of our slack, or the wish for the best itself, whereby we are not so clear struck and driven by our happiness and its means. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, happiness holds her own objects, as do success and other aims similarly. The thing is, that all things besides happiness are in a way reductive, for they put the subject at the will of something else: which their interest obliges. "Come here and I will care for you," says substance and invovlement; while happiness says, "wow, how great is it to be here and see the world," in which we'd confess our posture being the thing which enlivens us -like we showed up, rather than being greeted and taken care of. 
   <br>&emsp;The problem of philosophy though, is that the descriptions and amends of such happy ends, are not at all defined. You might say that history has gone from a state of closed handed preservation, to state security, to liberty; which can be applied towards benefits via a profession or mercantile trade, or towards the veil of the world which our freedoms have shown, and by that, heed the draw of such things, identifying them, rooting their worth and removing those contrary: to which we glow.
   <br>&emsp;It just seems that our happiness is bent on appropriate action. Yet, the bend of our ways still feel disposed to security and benefits. We seem lucky, or oppertune at least to achieve the latter; nor are the fretting bows at rest while the former is not ardently within our hand. Saying what things are then seems the issue, for we tend to run contrary to those normal ways; but are then exposed to ill definitions of the world; in that we are in fact unhappy and seeking those things, but unable to properly address them or mitigate our fancy, as such objects are undefined.
   <br>&emsp;In a word, happiness is in and of itself. Nor, does life withdraw you from her promise if you aren't travelling or inundated with free time and comfort. And, considering the diligence required to benefit outside the liberties for happiness within the state, so can we see what is actually of worth and means to acquire thorugh moderate efforts within such state. THe point though, is that the regards for that are not out of reassurance or justification. Yet, our need to do so, albeit born upon by the whims of those nearby, comes from the fact that you have comparable sights in mind; and despite their altered view, your frustration comes accordingly, as if you wish for success in a different way; yet, of that kind there is struggle when happiness is also concerned: and by that, neither seem eligble to share. 
   <br>&emsp;However, our description of the world gives us recourse on the nature of things, and otherwise clarity of what we'd choose. We cower not at the thought of not being the King of England; for that position is at least grand enough for us not to see it as obtainable, nor others beleiving we should. Whereas the novelty of touring and travel seems commonly accessible, that our lack of this seems alarming; at least we notice our interest in being mobile as subject to others scorn about us not being able to right now, or working towards it at least. The problem, is that we have no clear and steady definition for travel, in terms of what it means, and its limiting ends. Better yet, if we could state its actual favor, then that small point of comfort which such favor drew, could be a sincere point of promsie for me, and otherwise born against as we sought otherwise, or were simply not privy too. "It just feels like the whole world is not in our hand, less we know what the world is, when others see us doing nothing; whereby we seem to be exempt from nothing. And our aim of happiness has treated us to the world in our dearest ways; to which our lack of definition affords me the incoming impression of being without such extent. Yet, in describing such general ways, the world feels small, and their critiques are either not so present, or not unsettling."
   <br>&emsp;I think I might say then quite frankly what to believe. For one, death is natural, in that we are configurations of matter, by which our senses (and the ambigious tenure of mind) equate. By that, the product which is our thought and care, leaves as the organs which product it dissipate. By that though, the comparable experience of rest, whereby the body has worked well enough to finally turn off, shows us the beauty and preference of nothing: which, by our natural demise and seperation, promises us with an according eternity. Secondly is in regards to governance, and how it is fair so much as we wish for security, and that such interest requires organization. The legislature and execution of such arrangment holds a range of good and bad ends, but so are we twisting a screw with no torque -this does not remark about the merrit of the machine. By that, the government in its worst case holds unwarranted punishemnt, and of a corporal kind. Yet, the entirety of the populace is not subject to them; and generally, the worse threat is one lingering over their head; but so to is that made for submission so that the state's form of preservation can occur. But the law can always be followed, and decency in the worst of times can hold the day. While, those in anything favorable to, need not worry about overt slips. "Nor does death's gift warrant any utmost fear of pain; as such will end, or lead us to nothing and its rest." Thirdly, regards our duty as a man, which as a subject and that relation to the law, merely convides in the frugal use of the liberty received, and the all too simple task of electing those who would serve me. I do have the privelage of existing within the age of science and reason; as to remove any fear of casual torment or tyranny. But too, I can at least attest to the will and governance of those who would provide me with laws, representation, service and protection. 
   <br>&emsp;Culturally, things seem to spring from that, of which we are right to oblige, but within our excess amend. "Hence the American dream; which itself holds the implicit agreement that to bare the advantage of being an American, that one must exist as a citizen and member of America." And of those mentioned, that is our task. 
   <br>&emsp;Reason though does not stop here. For although the laws of warmth and satiety flow from the wells of the state, so is there a goverance appropriate for your heart. For, you see, the pressures which select the laws and state to be as they do, come from our nature as men, and our situation within nature. Which is to say that we must eat, sleep, secure, and otherwise humor the core advance of the species. This dynamic of environment and subject requires walls, along with those who man them. And at least as states are concerned, so are those within such bounds best to respect the custom of how such structure is helmed. From here though, the question becomes one, where the walls have sealed any threat, and that the invoice to the subjects is quickly met, whereby their time and fortune can be elsewhere cared. In that, we have the trickiest question of all: what ought we do with our freedom. For we do understand that such freedom was won, and that by that we mean that not always was excess so abundant, or free to spend. But I do beleive that the principle which our free time employs, is the same for those in chains. "We are merely the lucky ones, to be privy to freedom, and thus consider and explore such frontiers."
   <br>&emsp;At this point there are two core elements, one being the Good Life, and the other a contrast and assimilation between tradition and freedom. For the latter, this marks a reflective take, in that the world were in, with all its fair punishment and service, still holds roots of value born of less free times. And while the veil of dearness has receded, so is our time and means to see it still beholdened to the interests and pressures of older ways. This is a taxing disagreement, for it rests so cleanly on truths which are not concisely knonw. Yet, in our view, death, government and duty, are quite fair and fertile; albeit less so in the ways they are sometimes applied, but principally they are so. And by my accounts, the prevalance of the former has for a long time wained. So I would say we are right to advance upon freedom, and assess the question crucial to that: how ought we, upon a secure offer, live, when the qualitay of that life is whats important -as opposed to the mere prescence of it, or preservation of it rather (or mere existence). "What ought I do when I can plainly and correctly be? When our ability to be is not in doubt, then our mere existence holds no bar, as we are not under threat of confiscation or dismantle." 
   <br>&emsp;In short, I see how the elements of excess have come from our freeing ways. Yet, I believe that our state of modernity is one, where the concerns of security and task, are really bent on the means to obtaining benefit, as opposed to happiness. In other words, if we addressed what was required of us in order to be well off enough in order to advance our well being, then we would see a sizable seperation between what people in fact believe is required. That is the thesis, the trouble, or criticism. I cannot gracefully oblige old ways of being which were infact unbecoming of a true state, and how the annals of that have left both scarrs and impressions, to the effect that people's perceived freedom is not actually so high. But then even, I would say that there is no governing force which is pressuring you to own a large home, and acquire a requisite job. Such desire and occupation are beyond the fairest neccessities of life. And perhaps, the right diagnosis is one which remarks the likely symtpom of a state which offered freedom compared to one which did not, in that one which didn't would see its subject fine with hot water, air conditioning, interent, television, radio, transport, public service, free markets etc. While those in a free state would seek to expand their position, which to my point, is what we see. At least, those not impoverished or marginalized, seem to have their heads pointed at education and training, as to reach the professed means for equity and estates. 
   <br>&emsp;So I sympathize with one, in that they are not free enough to extend themselves; and our feeling is merely altlered by the fact that the quality of their ill freedom is one that satiety, warmth and comfort are not lacking. While those who are advancing themselves, are almost entirely doing so by means of excess. For the novelty of space within a larger home, or the luxury of a nicer looking car, is not at all a priority -by definition at least, when you consider how restricting circumstances would leave such efforts ahead. But in that, you have the point, in whether we have such circumstances: our state. And, if they are not restricting, and are in fact free for the subjects use, then ought our effort amend for the objects of novelty, frivolity, luxury and fame, or should we drench ourselves in the delights and leisure, industry and care; and color ourselves more dearly, plainly and pure? One of the core topics that holds less crucial truth as those of death and duty, is of children. And in that, the good role is one in which you oblige to give, rear and wait. And by that, their is a neccessary down payment, of what you will through the process give. And one of the key qualifiers, or markers rather for you being in the ready state to begin, is that you are the person you'd want your kid to be: in that you could help them reach the same. "And the point is not that they'd be a t-bone steak too, but that of the meat they'd cook, they'd equally know how to season, taste and enjoy: and ought we ourselves have learned and be able to thus teach, that the meat has to rest?" Unless you wish to have your children raised by someone else, or at any rate if you believe that your involvment won't effect them, then who you are upon having them is the kick off for such results. And so reagarding children at least, we can at least attest to the object and manifests of our life, as we would hope our children to advance and produce. "May they achieve more than me surely, but in goals and character of the game of happiness, rather than success."

<div id="ofvirtueandvice">
   For me personally, I feel quite split between virtue and vice. Moreover, it seems that the contempt of others is born from their own vice, and the scrutiny which their scale for judgement pings on me. This is so, for all ends are so if they are positive; yet if there is no end then there is no claim. Vice seems to let our poor tendencies take reign, and become the judge for what we assess and good and pursue. While reproach seems to suggest that our sense can helm better paths, with richer qualities as per the relation to truth. Yet in that, you are not always proceeding, or aimed, with an object. An important note is that I have vices to, or desires at least. And so when others condemn me for not being successfull, despite their poor view of the success I lack, there is still part of me that wishes to have a kind of success. 
   <br>&emsp;Its just not clear on what we ought to do. For we do have roots that make certain things pleasurable. But so is there a world of time, duty and death, that briefly, periodically and ultimately squanders my tasty amends. We can be drawn to something which pleases us now, but so is the truth an iron which evens us out, to the point where those moments of comfort, fair little upon the negativites which our neglagence or gluttony produce. That is the trouble you see, that there are all these incoming causes; and our desired effect is born only so when we are able to rightly oblige. In this sense, the notion of value and contrariety come in. For my time drinking is purely a detriment to our coming labors. But, if we were to enjoy some leisure or conversation in the time following, so would those dulling effects of drink lower that; to which our choice in the matter might lean in avoidnace, as we valued the time with activity and friends. And, to be clear, that because the nature of liqor and its comforts is known, so can we see that the value we'd have in our time otherwise would be drained. In that sense, we wish to make a purchase, and thus choose not to purcahse soemthing other; but one of the main reasons we witheld, is that the cost of the one good was so that the benefit (or size of good) of the other, was brought down so much as to not warrant that other good.
   <br>&emsp;Generally, there are amends for us which are based on neccessity, and in turn provide us peace and quiet; while those which draw us from these steady grounds, are rooted in the effects of excess; which themselves should not cause shortcomings to our neccessary responses, nor be only as positivie as to only enjoy a select amount of things, at the cost of others. This is why reading and writing is so wonderful, for it makes everything better, in both the soothing state which it procurrs, along with the effective product of having read and written. While drinking and crumby food tend to wipe all other activitires of an active sort away, and give the sole permitt to themselves. Yet such an expereince fails under further scrutiny. 
   <br>&emsp;What I lack, deliberatley, is a career, an aim, an objective. I can't say why I should have one though; or at least if it could be argued why I should, then I couldn't say which one I should have. For I believe the root of our efforts is born of desire; and by that, the reason for having an objective is that it promises such comfort. Yet I am not convinced that the objects of those desires are either good as the peace and stability of virtue, nor as pleasing and dear as the object of those. Perhaps that is the point, that stability is not crucially forgiven due to money and other fortune; as the composure of ourselves, our ultimate demise, and the otherwise requisite treatment of our intelligent mind, removes any real reason to achieve or succeed outside of peace's post. She may see and be drawn; and by admittance we are all imperfect, and pressed as such during our duties and tasks. But so is the fair line of growth one where those demands are evened out (and less pressing), as is our ability and care to respond, more effective and less consuming. The might of discernment then, says that the peace found in such neccessity, is good enough to be, while you are gratefully so, or more liberally drawn. Which itself, is not a limiting stance on certain goods. But of those which have their roots in relief and comfort, so will the path of that flatten out to ends which are staked on fortunes outside of our peace and moderate comfort. And by that account, those goods which compell us in such liberal (or excess ways) can be fairly deemed as truely so, when they are not so drawn out, and effect us in fleeing ways -whereby our steadyness is ruffled. Where instead, we act, consent and proceed, in ways most becoming to the peace born appropriateness within neccessary action, and that of pure felicity.

   Circumstances can definitely tweak a certain strand of you, revealling the nature of the core complex. Simply, there a things I must be doing, which is to say that there are holes which will widen and implode less I address them. This usually includes our mortal regard, our family intent, our health and otherwise frugal disposition. In front of this though lies things which you wish to become apart of, to be treated with, or provided from. These are your childish fancies to be famous, to explore the world, to be all high and mighty in your excitement, and impressive in this: to be known. The reality though, is that these things require as much effort to facilitate as their view is grand. And when you take the fact of touring, and compare that to the limitless view of travelling the world, you can see how one is really some fancy that compares to one's dream of being King, while the other is an activity, and at hand with something achievable amongst whats common. Yet, in viewing it as touring, or having enough investment as to move past soul or collective happiness, but sole wealth and collective management, the dream seems less alive, as it is not really one, but a thing instead. 
   <br>&emsp;Now, shouldering all this is the most elusive prompt, which is similar to those of a negative kind, but more prone to offer something positive. Whereas your health speaks out to you, saying that our nature is such that withotu certain regards, the environment will cause certain effects. While the sun, offers us a point to blossom from, as marvelling in her, defining her ways, relishing what she means, or in other words treating her, does more than simply brace our bones, but flourish the beat of our heart, and otherwise remove any rust and immobility to our soul. Dreams some to reflect this, in that they are points which offer some sort of promise. Yet, the distance of those spots comes equally to how far the start of our gaze is distant from our selves. That is why I say, that if we are near and at hand, where peace is our common state, then the points of interest are those which unveil themselves from that. Besides the actual distance, there's a sort of fuzziness, as if what is common is selected based on how well we can be drawn to it. So those who relief themselves and otherwise fail to bolster their corporal needs, may not be struck by the color and industry thats pointed out to them; while a more obvious trip might. And at any rate, as those fuzzy ends match the quality of the person, so would a broader wish that came from someones dream -albeit ingraced to their pecuniary means- would still be but of a more fancy novelty. As, one who is in their norm, sees a trip to somewhere close by as exciting, while someone who's sight lies further, and builds their means to amend, does have a nice trip -as if it were exotic and out of this world. But so is it still a trip, and of a touring kind.
   <br>&emsp;And so it seems preferable to be in a state of content, and oblige those dearer interests pointed out from there. Yet, sometimes it feels like our demands are within our grasp, and nothing is so plainly set for us to do. At this point, the weariness that comes from being content raises its tide; though, it is not but a known truth that this occurs because the vitality of your requirments and felicitiy of interest which your content is central too, is not so definite and thus known. So being content feels like were missing out, as someone who is but stable too and sees a vacation, might look at you and say, 'oh wow, your so evened out and free, why not take a nicer trip; or better yet, beyond the pecuniary need, why not form a life revolved around travelling, or being a rockstar, or anything for that matter that would reminsisce of our dreams: for you are free, with all the time in the world: why not marshal it for the greatest of things!'. And my response is a critical one, as I see those boundless desires and dreams as unbecoming, if and only if their view and station is one that holds only a life for you. And the reality is, that once you see anyone looking past, and you are in fact treated to the nature of your life and quality of time, you realize that all is there only for you, and that less everyone thinks your special, and your adventure makes you remarkable and cool, so are you left with the mere activity at hand: which doesn't compare to what is born through felicity: and by that, the truth in that our life really is our time -for who is so distant from themselves in that sense- favors us more when the actions and steps are of leisure, industry and care. While the magnificence of Shambala, or the intrigue made from your ways, is really the curse of novelty and remission; as these things come from those outside themselves, or furried at least, and thust are drawn and set past those centered lands of peace and fecundity. Where instead, the time and activity which draws their hand, is that of a more exoctic and glamorous sort. Yet, the core critique, is that the shape and product of these ventures, no matter how well realized, have their worth and anticipation rooted in the fancy'd expectation that other people will  care, and that it is not so much what seeing the pyramids or touring the world will bring, but what it means rather. "And by that, the stake of this, seems to be in what we'd recieve, as our time and person seem so beautifull and interesting: who wouldn't offer me their own time and attention, and reward me thus."

   I think the reason were feeling a little awry, is our lack of power; which in this modern age, is bound to money. Power isn't so worthwhile in when it comes to mortality, family and health, but regarding certain novelties and flavor, so is cash required. Worth noting is that we are not working, and thus any cost upon us drains our cash. While, if we were working, to a neutral point even, the income we had would afford me some relief; for credit is not so harsh -especially when you are not making large expenditures.
   <br>&emsp;But, what comes to mind then, is whether more money should be sought, or we should amend ourselves as appropriate without money. Both choices are subject to the general truths of our lives; for be it ambitious or peacefull, we are still men.
   <br>&emsp;Theres been this notion for along time, whereby our personal effords would be improved, or bolstered at least, if we had the means for fun and privilage. This usually amounted to hoping for family fortune, or that of fame. But such hardly come to pass, or at least must be waited upon. And this is fair. As our life has become more objective, and our satiety within that has relieved any pressing need for such things to be more than themselvs, so has everything smoothen out. Yet, we had the fair means to purchase a scooter, as to improve our own localle lives. Be it in casuall strolls, practical adjustment to weather and time, or the broader means to accomodate living situations -as food, work and interests have further ranges, and thus bear us a broader selection of viable places to live. Only, this scooter is a vehicle, and is subject to repair. In particular, reckless use affords consequences, or the chance at least. And by that, we seem powerless to oblige. At least, our lack of income seems to leave us exposed to the cut of our reserve. 
   <br>&emsp;On that note, it is worthwhile to mention how being clear and objective in your life removes this draining feeling. At least, since our efforts and aims are made on things of felicity and care, so do our worries of power wain; as we need none of it; nor is our depletion of it consequential. Moreover, the base notion that neccessity requires the means to it, so is our clarity and stable means to achieve that, one which bolsters our otherwise discontent and spilling our excess. In that, power, albeit the same in what it is within our basest efforts, is realy banked on excess. Yet in that, the value of acquiring that power is worth questioning. For, ceratin things require no power, but time and effort. While those occupations which yeild power, require their own efforts. Worth is one thing, while accounting is the other. At least, if we look at particular cases, we can see how much time and effort is needed in order to get the minimum, or an extent; whereby we can cover the breadth of all cases, and consider how we should apply. At least, we may look at life as composed of factors; and objectively, each has its product and requirments, and can thus be arranged in terms of the effort you put in, and what you get out.
   <br>&emsp;For me, a core point is that of minimums. For we may put a little bit of effort into many things, with the thought that each will give us a little. Yet, considering how even the itinerary of each requires more time than the actual appointments, bears equal regard as what those appointments require of us to earn something at all. This is like saying that we can pursue medicine to a certain degree, and thus recieve a reward of equal degree. Yet one can not be a partial doctor. Nor, beyond the requisite education, can one likely find employment part time. Or, if they did, it would likely be of a particular case, and less lucrative. This is just our assessment though. For, we might say that value allows us not to describe every single case, and determine which one is favorable. At least, rather than exhaust our options as to be clear on which ones are best, let us refine what makes the best things what they are, by defining the scale by which such things become the best. In that, I find that most things are good because you enjoy doing them; and otherwise they bear security. And as we assess ourselves in particalr -beyond the general qualities- we notice that there are many core factors worth tending to, or consequnetial at least if not. And by that, we can see that ignoring those leads to desires and affability to ends which are in truth novel. For, our body bears us a measure of health; and beyond its longevitiy, so is its nearer paces measured in vitality and strenght. If its state is crumbier though, or worn, than what we seek and judge by, will reflec that. And, for the sake of discernemnt, we say that those things which are good, but so from our poor state, are novel; for their worth is not actually from any point of strenght, but shortcoming. "Relieve my pains and squabblings: such a request is not becoming though, as its worth is based on you not being who you really are."
   <br>&emsp;What I would conclude with, for our benefit, is this notion of a brace; which is to say that we cannot simply do the minimum amount, for consistency will wain; nor can we do a small amount at all and expect anything worthwhile. In that, we ought to let our reasoning determine the values of our selves, and thus appropraite to what is fair and obvious to that -in the cases were judging at least. Yet, in order not to let any loosness, experience or incoming impressions unsteady you as to your amends, let us put a brace on those we have selected; as to remove any fleeing fear or discontent at the fact that 'were missing out on those other things'. For in those we deemd well, we are already tasked enough, nor lacking the according reward. And, at any rate, what we consider well to adjust, is the lenght of that brace and where it applies, and those things which fit upon such standard of value. But of those fancy's behind us, which in our complacency to the good even, fairs no worth in our regard: for of what is familiar as dear, is either being worked on, or known. "So even in our idling states, we need not fear the quench of other frivolitises. For the good holds our commitmment."

<div id="livingjoy">
   I know who I am. I am boundless within a powerless state: and all those who are not so and seek the latter, stick little to our farther ways -as we are but light and gentle, however far, while there aim is from further below, to a place which is limited by power. While for me, the only limit is what I can see and treat.
   <br>&emsp;We are afraid though, perhaps because we are still with a body. And, weirdly, it is words which remove our bounds, in that we can acquire more with what is at hand; or at any rate not be taken by things we may not have (as our lack of power reflects). Yet, we still have needs, and cannot live in that boundless way. Only, our minds and spirit can transcend that; yet, in our natural case, this is not something we wish for, but see right now. The sun is always there, as the abscence of it would render us not so. As is the mooon somewhat essential, and present no less. The color of the sky is forever on, as are the sounds of the wind, birds, nothing. The color of it all can provide a constant amazement, as can the reality which spurrned others wonder and thought, treat us -as if it were from the scent alone. 
   <br>&emsp;These are living joys, as opposed to those promised after we are not within a body. To that there is rest, while this body of mine, sees it has everything it could have; and it is words and ideas which remove, rearrange, conceive and align to further wonders of the world. By that, we are free, and deliberate with our unbounded sense -which, as it were, becomes so as our needs hold less attention. By that, the world can be seen and our treatment drawn. 
   <br>&emsp;Yet, this is not overwhelmingly so for all people. And in fact, even those who I see as comparable, rest only near the edge of the domain; and in fact have their sights and hold on those realms adjacent. In that we are alone, outside the cave to ourself. In many ways there are people who are forward, but they are but on nicer properties within the realm of fortune. While my location is within vastness of liberty and treatment.
   <br>&emsp;What I see, is that our resolve is like the sun, in that I choose not when and where I shine, but gleam everywhere I stand. In that, I am never alone, for I am bolstered from within. Yet, I cannot say exactly what the right path is; and by that, I wonder whether we are contridcting ourself in temrs of our intentions; whereby we would actually be better off moving towards things within a better oriented stare. As long mentioned, our general view was that our shine would be known by others, to which we'd be well off. But, this is no longer our stake; and thus our perfection is removed; to which we have room to partake in things which would otherwise run contrary to perfection -but still fair.
   <br>&emsp;In a way, we are in fact with power, as the results of contribution in fact fill me up; which isn't something that travelling the world or being famous differs from. Its usually the material limits that power is referring to, while the actual activity were in usually holds our more heartfelt hand. Yet by that, all is known, and through words and reading we treat it. How rich I am. 
</div>
<div id="raisingourcourse">
   It seems like our means for things is not much outside ourselves. Even our scooter, which seemed so promoising, requires more than our common life can procurr. Though, this is but circumstantial, as we are living quite private.
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, the matter of money, or power comes to question. For I don't think there's much worth in what it provides, compared to those true bouldess activites. But even if there is worth, it is not to relieve your own shortcomings, but of neccessity, or fairness at that.
   <br>&emsp;I think what is reassuring is considering that there is a bound, by which we can attest to our lack, and otherwise found power and reward through our own faculties. Which, to be clear, is not so much about being resourcefull and disciplined, as to acquire, but to see, read, write, rest.Those things may be viable, in that you can simply try, but their distance is as far as your control is required.
   <br>&emsp;I just feel isolated, like were on an island with no where to go. Even once we move, I am sure that the regularity of work and limitation of your walking ways, will foster some discontent. At least, clarity can give things and their requisites more worth, in that they are more definite in how you spend. But generally, it seems like most things are in need of something more than our common effort can procurr. And as it were, if those means of ours directed themselves towards the means of acquiring those outer things, so would this come at the expense of our dearest efforts; nor would the  contentment of being simply alright, be in accordance with seeking more. This isn't so explicit.
   <br>&emsp;I look at our familiart with the true goods, and how are content is really so, yet worn against as we are so outside anytrhing else. And so, as our discontent wains, so does our purity; in that we can not just be alright, and look forward to our avtivity tomorrow; but we have to be busy, and thus our free time becomes indulgent; which itself has no real amends in such pecuniary ways, but then drenches our means for activity. Simple improvements and the vulnerable try things which are not much more than appointments, offers us potential fairly. But to me, the goods of leisure, industry and care, are such that a flow of life is all we need. Being incomplete about this though, brings our properity away from what our activity breathes from; and otherwise our mealy attempt to acquire power sees us empty handed. In fact, the tale of my life has been in those idle ways, whereby neither happiness or success was found: and our constant refinement of the former. And again, it is not that money, friends, romance or impact can't be had, simply even. But these are not what were judged by; or at least what our impressions scorn us against. Those bear upon us the values of tradition or adolescence, in that we don't have enough security or estates; or on the other hand, were not swashbucklers or rockstars. 
   <br>&emsp;This is all in conflict what those things which actually make me happy. Yet, of these, they are but truer fortunes ontop of a solid man; which is to say that we have our own and current wares, and merely occupy ourselve in appropraite ways to those seperate goods. But, if we are scrutinzed, or isolated, due to those other lackings, then so are we unable to be ourselves; nor are the true goods we lack able to be seperate from us with an otherwise equanimity, but shame and dissaproval. "As we are looked down upon to not have a home or be a success, so are pressured to feel similarly poor in not having what we atually seek. Whereas before, we could view these desires with groundess and faith." So by that, our own happiness is in fact worn when what we seek is so stringently absent. Yet in our peacefull ways, so are we fine and ready; and herein able and free to pleasantly proceed. But when those intrusions of fear and brattiness come in, they disettle to, to which we comfront such intrusions, but feel unsteady too about our actual wishes. 
   <br>&emsp;In that, it fairs well to have clarity on btoh ends, as not to be so exposed to what others critique you on -for you see their weakness, or, through comparison or fortitude succeed elsehwere. Or, on the other hand, breathing more definition into what you really seek brings life to your course, and otherwise makes your advance to things more buyont and present; as if you are rich, but from these gentle grounds. "Like we are set within ourselves, but bearing fortune, because we can more clearly see it. Combingin that with the ease on arrival, makes our course one which is truly integral, as in the present, but sweet and warming as the gradual promise which our natural path gleams, seems more obvious and clear."
</div>
<div id="properpath">
   So I can mention alot, but I will do so with clear definition and discernment. Firstly, the future is bright by the merrits of privilage, whereby you are given things owed, fortune, whereby things outside your domain favor you -ie. tax returns, goverment gifts- chance, whereby oppertunity and or change offers benefit, and congruence, whereby your inner equities bring your own soverign goods, or your fortitude can endure what is lacking in neccessity or novelty. These elements afford one the steady supply of improvment, whereby their natural and composed prescence, affords them both the means to amend, learn and grown, and otherwise receive, by expectation, gradation or receipts. 
   <br>&emsp;In that, I am more accustomed to let the future happen. And while this doesn't grant me much in terms of kingship or wealth -outside our lineage at least- I am not so concerned as to be unset towards that, as my aim is moreso towards the activity within my life, and the pleasures and goods that surround that. In that sennse, my main task, when benefit is to be occrued by faith and the currents of favor and time, is to clarify what we don't need and that which we do, so that our current happiness doesn't implode under our own fleeing whims, or others intruding scorn -at me not being so direct. In that, if we can idenitfy things, then their worth can be defined as bounded, without worth, or out of interest. Moreover, of those things which I would like, so can their natural pace come about as we are not so withdrawn from them in our own merry process. That is all to say, that if we are sure of the things we like -in what they mean and amount to- then we will not be so dischevled at being withtou them; for their place on our path will seem more known. In effect, we are not so hollow in sincerity; and so when we are unable to fend off complaints or fears regarding our lack of interest in other things, so will we not be revealed -or disheartened internally- at the lack of things which we would in fact like. For such things take their own time to procurr; and at any rate, are but natural desires which are better accompaniments then occupations. These amount to earning more money through suitable trades, making friends by sharing being open about your interests, finding romance or relationships by simply trying (through resources, or improved communication), and being happy amidst others, whereby our broadest efforts and industry are built on what we sincerely wish to produce and speak about, and thus feel rewarded at even the slightest agreement and or interest by other's. Whereas being successfull amongst other people requires that your attract a great deal of people, and towards a source who's form is bent for pecuniaries sake, so is the form of our source whose bend is done so for happiness, needs only attract a few. For it is in many ways enough for me; and as I smolder the embers into the mildest of flames, it is simply alright to feel the warmth yourself, and enjoy whoever seeks the same. Its not reassure, but the annals of gradual progress, fostered through our sincere intent, means that our fire will grow, more will attend, and whereas a couple if not a hundred folk were drawn, so could we reach a thousand. Again, the limits are not our concern, as we are pleased right now, and looking merely to advance that pleasure into a place and through a suitable form, as to be happy, in that we were trying, and others shown -with receptivity, to which 'we are happy' becomes so. A million followers or subjects based on something that I would not be keen towards myself, is worth less to me than a 100, 30 even, when the flame which we gather around, or at least the words which come from the pulpit that I stand, is one becoming of me: which itself, on the grounds of our maturity, is remarked of the dearest things. To which I alone, with a few, and even more whereby the admittedly fair amount would still seem extreme, is enough. So I stand.
   <br>&emsp;And quickly, as it must be mentioned, is that due to our ups and downs as are natural to our living nature, so is it usefull to understand the worth and futility in the objects of wealth. Namely, travelling and infamy. Simply, the former holds goods that more often than not reflect a composure which is already unsettled; whereby, if the mere act of travelling is whats deemed good, then it is not likley that what is truyl good on arrival, will be known. For touring is one thing, and even the worst of us may earn much favor. Yet we still return to our ordinary lives. Its the constance of moving and all the excitment and anticaption which that brings. Yet there isn't anything different wherever you go; and the only thing that does in fact differ, is where you see yourself going, in that more is to come. Yet you must always continue. Nor, is the journey much of worth, as unless you are on your feet, then you simply pass everything by: with either too much speed or focus required to operate your means for transport. And at that, you are left with the sensation that you are going. Not only does our buisness, family and or congruence with well being flatten the interest or ability to constantly move. And by that, momentary moves, either settle into familiarty, or are but novelties, in both experience and remedy: for life is returned too: and at any rate, the gift of what you see is not so saturating when the flavor is based on neweness or difference: as that will not translate to an imoproivment of what you see upon your return. In other words, the value of moving is not so dear to me, as its efforts are taxing, costly, novel, and otherwise besides our interest of leisure, industry, and care. To be fair, those real goods delight in having a life which is less simple and common; yet, the ability to change that, is so that either cash is spent on moments of change, or transitions at that: yet the quality of your life remains. Being more mobile holds some favor, but again, not much more than smoothing out your dearer efforts. And at any rate, whatever pleasure comes from being more mobile, requires the training and employment within suitable roles. Which itself, takes time, a minimum amount of committment and interest as to maintain your invovlement, and a similar standard as to retain your ability throughout your employment. Time can be spent, and the natural development from student, apprecntince into the journeyman state whereby our leverage can be brought wherever, is not barred from us. But only a select amount of positions offer rewards of that kind. Nor is that requirment for all this a limiting factor of our lives; merely a garnish to what is otherwise secure and comofrting. Our address is merely one of leninance; whereby we feel more content with the common paces of our liberty, and apply ourselves (through committment and itinerary) for those novel benefits. But it is surely a campaign within its own right, as you must pick the right path, stick to it while your are prior to the real benefit; and otherwise apply yourself upon that, which itself deserves some regard -as the end which your choice is based on, waivers both on the reward which you seek, and the ultimate obligation which that requires. I feel that infamy can be assessed this way. For those ends come through means which are not becoming or servicebale to liberty; or, if they come from liberty, or run beside it, so are those paths comaprable to that of trades, in that you must learn, practice and deploy. The dynmics of attraction are one thing, for you obivously won't earn everyone's regard overnight. But so is the campaign which will foster all those stages of growth, a long one. In some sense, we are talking about bringing our liberal goods to a successfull state; but so is the buisness of that a constant one. For as you attract some, the leverage that you have is only usefull in that it attracts more. And I do mean to be open about this, for if I have time, then the training required can be adhered to. Though, the employment fairs questioning. Generally, if your success is digital, then that can be brought anywhere. And to be fair, this is the clear desire. At least, in terms of a profession or source of income, so would you want it through a computer. You just have to consider how much the a mobility of your life will cost, in both the training and occupation. If we had all the money in the world currently, so would we simply apply ourselves into expanding our happiness. And that earns little favor from money, but soothing our fatigue. 
   <br>&emsp;In short, online trades and community take time, and otherwise grow with our constant additions. All for the sake of soothing our fatigue. And otherwise, our genuine time which holds the value in our invovlement as compared to the monetary ends, is immediate, as our employment is but through our intent and activity. "Registering for something in that sense is exciting, for we are stepping towards what you want to do. While, if our excitement is based on the intiaition down a path which is lucartive, then so is the distance of that end bare us a hollowing effect: for we are not so privilaged now."
</div>
<div id="howweare">
   So I know not the finality of things, in either ends, origin, or, accordingly, substance. But, I can ask qualified questions; which, in effect, bears me an idenitity of such ends, but with reproach.
   <br>&emsp;On the other hand, more local matters, or at least prompts which are not neccessarily reproached, can be more meagerly qualified. In that, we can more clearly identify things how they actually are, or otherwise evaluate them based on select criteria. 
   <br>&emsp;For instance, Canada is a free country, in that all have suffrage, there are laws which can be followed, liberty to be gained, and otherwise punishment which is earned on the basis of crimes, rather than custom. This is what Canada is. 
   <br>&emsp;But in another light, I might outline the general field of government, in that there are those who have fair laws and punishment, harsh laws and fair punishment, harsh laws and according punishment, no laws and acceptable punishment, or the worst, no laws and horrid punishment. I can say that Canada fits into the foremost. And although the US, Britain and France are not so exposed within by domain of knowledge, so am I confident in saying that their punishments are not handed out indiscrimanetly, and with any harsh corporal edge. So much as they are not in fact lower, I am confident in placing them in that first category. For each, as far as I do in fact know, is a republic, or confederacy of states; and even Russia, who's executvie power supposedly is much fimrer than most, still compares in having laws and the means to obey them. This, mind you, is only current, as they quality of such realms varies as we go back in time. But right now at least, we seem quite privy to a country which I can strictly identify as good, and at any rate qualify as preferable; alongside the bulk of other major countries; and the even further advent of united nations and leagues. "A confederacy of nations, rather than the sole nation makeup of states: countries are the latter."

   Due to the very concret nature of governance, it is quite easy to speak on its behalf. In a way, writing about real things is always easier; only, in the case of society, the elements are actuall of relevance to me, compared to our thoughts on astronomy for instance.
   <br>&emsp;Anyways, the core mark which has stuck within me is this distinct notion of 'man and subject', the latter being a member of the state, and at least with respect to other subjects, that is an association. While the man, is merely so, in that his status as a subject is similar to his post within a profession:  whereby we'd say he is in association within that. What a man is innately is not so easy to say, but I do enjoy this distinction. For me, the example of two folks on a deserted island, who are people outside of any state, and are thus only privy to their personal selves. Yet, if they obliged to amend to eachother with the aim of further prospering, and through rules and organization, than to eachother they would be associated as subjects; or at least if there were more than two of them, those who were of the authoritarites would hold those outside as their subjects, who in turn are subjects of such state; and otherwise in association to other subjects; which is to say, that as men, they are members in association amongst eachother with respect to their shared post as subjects within the state.
   <br>&emsp;Second on my mind is this learing notion of honor and liberty. On one hand, it seems the latter comes from order, or at least regality and its admonition to one's standing. Strict respect for elders, parents, those within the nobility or courts, or even one's who are simply of higher status civilly, marks such a tendency. In this, the worse one usually recieves is scrutiny over their disrespect. Which itself contrasts with the linens of liberty, whereby one's freedom and whims is what is both reverred and demonstrated. It is by these where the friction between people lie. For one may have that wandering heart, but be part of a family who is orderly and hierarchical. Or, someone may be of a liberal kind, and free to be so, but notice points that are more regal, and thus risks for incoming scorn. This is where I personally find myself subject to frustration. For my parents are free going, yet act sometimes as though their place as parent's holds the merrit of their age. While other times, there are those without much regality, and thus my own personal tideinss seems unfitting. This is all fine, but so do are idling times recieve an emphasis of scorn; and usually by others who appear to be condeming me for my lack of position; or, I am jealous, and at least footnoting my reasons elsewhere to not be galavanting, or living without structure at least. Simply, the world is a mix, and be it tendencies within a culture, to those within a family, it seems that the shine coming out of everyone is varied. This is the mark of an unhappy man though, for what I deem right, ought flourish from our amends, and thus sturdy us with both stability and content, and in effect not notice the flames of others.

   My scooter is a seldom expense; nor is its purpose short of essential: in its addition at least. It is being serviced though, and so I cannot help be feel some angst at the thought of whether it will be fixed. And although the issue isn't large, I am not convinced there wont be future problems. There are reasons for our issue; nor have the proper preventions been employed. The nature of our way is simply at risk; and by that I will likely not purchase a scooter which isnt with solid tires. By that, there is some room to try the current repair; and from their, we can try and solve the problem along normal lines, or make a larger investment for a more reliable scooter.
   <br>&emsp;Simply though, are output is flourishing. Effectively, we have nothing we really have to do; though, the pace of our day is somewhat compact, espcially without the scooter. Were quite occupied, and without much room to recouperate; which itself bears reason to attend our past times; but so are we a little bundled amidst those. Still, the scooter was ment to support this course of life, and in most ways has. It just isnt so stable in doing so, particularly in more adventurous ways. Nevertheless, these future appointments can bear the slowing rate of our days, by resting on the fact that such eveness will be the norm, and that such appointments will in fact accomodate that. So right now, if your a little bent, those involvements will actually do you good; but even if you dont want to, remember that their requirment is small, and that by attending you make the future attendences more swift and approachable. And since our normal pace will prefer that anyway, do yourself a favor and work through the fear attendace -in that it makes you slow- as both a current remedy, or stabling committment.
   <br>&emsp;Besides that, there is really not much but our activity. Our health is ripe for concern, and our activity of life has some composure by those outward committments. But we really are free and able to do as we please. Which, naturally has limits, and otherwise fidgits a little as your haste bears more hopes ahead. But so will this iron itself out; and our scooters final repair will not fail to support that. Really though, I just want to read and write; and walking thorugh the day, sitting where we can, exercising in and out, brings me cheer and a neccessary stature, as to breath and live truly. Everything else wraps around this nicely. And even those further amends, have more room than you'd think; or at least your fortunate enough to have such wiggle room; but the means and reason to bind to even the shorter side of things. 
   <br>&emsp;So by that, I feel set for an inward settlement; whereby we are truly at ease while occupied, and proceeding by the delta of time, as the future becomes present and we merrily ride along. By that, I see our finances as a ripe support. And considering were tired, and yet to explore the immediate options, so will we fix our scooter: which seems the most worthwhile, as it allows us to broaden our currated life. Theres no advantage which holds no worth. Yet, it is still an addition; and of what core, so can we fair rightily by our own: this is but our inquiry and means coming as one: like we once did we flat foot shoes. It surely wasnt the best purchase; though I cant really despair, as our worse fear was its actual ability to pleaase us; while now, it seems that even the basics would do; while the place for it though actually holds its own bars. Still, we can ultimately amend, and otherwise furnish our local life. Which, addmittedly, our respect and reflections would later oblige. I need not much more than what our future needs. And in that, I seek the fragments, videos and shows, an occasioanl movie, and the games which furnish my life. Exercise in its own right pairs swell with deliberate occupation, as your freedom in that sprouting end, settles your movement and training into being sufficinet upon completion. "Which is to say that there isnt fear or worry that there isnt something more in what its for. But me, and all our cheer in being so vital."
   <br>&emsp;In that, lifes specifics hold a fair course, and an otherwise adaptable road in front. Mom and Dad are leaving, which improves all steps, and our general health allows us to make use of the warming lands. Otherwise, our working vehicle gives us a great place to read, or further angle to see our country. Which, admittedly, is something were losing; though that really reflects your worn out pace. Usually the day holds all when your really well; and by that, what is familiar brightens you still: for your there so much to treat it.

<div id="relevantthings">
   Quickly, I must mention this remark made by Kant, whereby the battleground for non-emperical experience is in metaphysics. By that, I relate, but no in the need of such a basic anwser; rather, I am amused by our own particularity, and what I acutally seek to know and explore. In terms of knowledge, I see much that is covered in whats common; and fairly, I think any confusion there is from a weak toolset of how objects are within entirety; and how our premature depiction of the latter bears mistakes in the former. By that, I believe that death is merely a description of a living thing disconfigurating; as if by time and physioolgy we whithered away. So on and so forth, there isnt much knowledge which I cant explain, or consider at least as merely relevant within our objective realm. What entirety is in its own right, seems beyond these common questions, but is a curisoity no less. And perosnally, I see our notion of space's existence as a prompt for ontology, as to consider that fact. And by that, there is much description which can detail entirety. But as for its relevance, I would not say it is so in any traditional way. What I would say, is that although I know the consequences of life are a time of peace, and freely, I still think our amends to that is one of angst; which in fact remarks our curisoity to begin with, as knowing the whole would give more relief regarding our part. So there is a purpose in having an ontology, as it bears us down the chartered road. Only, the merrit of this understanding can become to bent onto having one at all, as opposed to it being true. And over time, I'd venture that our views on ourselves are made with respect to our ontological positions; only these are incredibly weak, or without the strenght that our beliefs would suppose. In a way, we are being ontological when we refer to things as being only ostensibly configured of entirety; and that although  I may not know what that entirety is, so are those subjects (or configurations) are within the domain of what I actually care about; or at least, can be defined as subjects, and act as a sufficent anwser. In other words, death is merely a part of us, as things; though the actual mark of death and our being dead, is not but a part of our place as things, but not strictly born from the entirety of things itself. In that sense, the nature of things is so that all things would compare. While a flame dying out due to a lack of oxygen and fuel, is merely an objective end, or at least advancement of the configuration of things: and our death is no different: but, accordingly, is not an actual mark of the end of all things, or at least things in their entirety, but our own configuration. That is, death is to do with living, and by that, the pieces which form rocks and air, are but dissamebly from their microbial legacy (of which we are the current step as mammals): and as members within that, so does our state change from young, to old, to nothing. Hereby, the expereince of warmth and memory fade, and we are no more: there is not what is effectively true for an atom, or a thing in its entirety: which defintiively, is not of those things which only come from configuration.

   I am indeed quite tired, and in effect unable to think. Part of the reason, is that my body is overly stiff; albeit of a gentle sort, as there is in fact no pain, it is not exactly broad and open, to which our mobility and vitality wain. 
   <br>&emsp;One of the consequences to this though, is that in situation, of namely poltiics and logic, where opinions are ardently, or at least prudishly made, I am unable to remain reproached with thought. And, generally, I believe most of their views to be wrong, or at least the position of their arguments to be inferior to ones becoming of the whole world, or entirety. By this, I either restlessly disagree, or uncomfortably reproach through thought: which itself causes further wear.
   <br>&emsp;This is a nice sentiment though, as I have struggled with this for years; particularly in politics or civil cases since moving in with my parents. The probelm isnt that their views are wrong, or weak  for that matter, but their insistence, or committment to the view. There is very little reproach of their own, which makes both their stance seem hollow and rigid; but equally, the actual issue at hand is given way to much prevelance, for what its worth at least. 
   <br>&emsp;PErsonally, I know everything; at least, if there was a true encylopedia, I could assign everything to a specific portion, or realm at least. This segregation within the domain is something I understand, even if the actual parts I dont know. But, I have a wholesome sense of the world and entirety; and by that, I see the issues of reason and presidency to be mild at best. Moreover, my actual views on those things are no different than our views on the finer issues, in that each is dealt with thought and care, not opinions or assumption. 
   <br>&emsp;I must say that as my understanding grows, so do I feel more content inwardly, as even my restless state wears little in its disposition. Which is to say that Kants massive treatise on reason may overwhelm our thinking, but so is its importance but a heirloom of thought. By that, our need for significance is not bothered, as the thing were seeing isnt so inflammatory against our priorities. Still, the actual thinking wears me thin, as beyond the initial sentence or two where he's curious and speculative, he then goes 700 pages on about what he is so clever to prove. I don't mind his confidence, or his lauding over traditions head; but he's so clear on his means and form of inquiry, that I cant help but be put of by the entire lack of substance: which, ultimatley, comes down to the emphasis on ideas, rather than things. At least for me, personally, my wonderment about the bones of nature come from the appearences of her products, and the mystery of how those came to be. I may be privilaged to be so skeptical since the advent of real cosmology, but so has that merely extended the reach by which our ultimate curiosity should go. Yet, I find little relation in what most people say, as it points little to any existing end; which, in my own experience, falls way short of those ultimate bounds. "As if someone said, with a practical guarantee, that I'd be wholly rich and powerful, eternally even. Yet, principally, I did not know the nature of guarentees, or the bounds of time." 
   <br>&emsp;At this point our own argument comes into question; as it makes little sense that there would be a laundry list of theories and ideas, based similarly will say in terms of topics, and that each held the same merrit and truth. It would be odd for nature to be a mixture of ways; or at least, of entirety, that it would have more than what we'd more prudently say 'as its nature', meaing one -or its. I am not so educated as to refute or consider all the elements and cares of those before me. As I see it, they are merely using an assortment of tools to identify and describe nature. Explanations seem somewhat contradictory, less you believe that nature is seperate from the products -or in our case, subjects- that she would seemingly be the bearer of. Or in other words, how would heat and sound, tissue, cells, molecules, atoms, particles, waves and space be ontop of something, and not the webing itself. Intuitively, I'd say our task is to be so reflective, and describe things on the basis of what a proper description is. But in that, we have an issue, as the entity of space is not fully known; and by that, it is hard to even say 'all of existence in and of itself'. In effect, we are somewhat barred from approaching our description in such a way. Here though, the ultimate challenge lies.
   <br>&emsp;You see, if something isnt knonw, the only way to proceed is throug inquiry. I am more than aware of givens that people take, and otherwise maxims (so to speak) that permitt the whole extent of maxims used to generate principles. But we are trying to define the world. Nor, does it massiveness warrant much ignorance of its prescence; rather, the merrit of determinging the means for inquiry, is quite worthless besides its offer of defining the actual entities at hand. Simply, to reiterate somewhat, we are of the opinion, or at least our reproach has kept us from falling over ourselves, whereby we still retain this sense, that things are not seperate from a supposed nature which procurred them, but that all is complete in unison and entirety. Those two notions may contradcit, as the former suggests a real individuality and thus conflicts with any real notion of entirety. But so are we demonstrating discourse, and by that, we mean only to further stitch our subjects and inquiry. There are indeed common rules that warrant this; and ultimately, if that seems intellectually squeemish or cowardice, I would still say that we are appropriate to be on the edge of what is actually known, and that the a priori principles that regard the ideas of things, is not decent or integral enough to play the actual things their supposing. Those real things, would remark the nature whihc we suppose. But so are those things needed for our investigation. I may not have the tutelaged means to say why there would be no issue if nothing real was known but that which was a priori, but that would surely be a non existant place. And, most presumably, any existence for which those misty reasons reflect, holds no real bearing itself, as the actual bounds and substance of such reality is unknown. Particularly, this regards the quandery of space, and that, in comparison to say a bowl which held nothing in it, that space was not in fact outside the bowl, but a part of the container. Differing the notion of abscences amongst the medium, is the trily voident notion of nothing, in that there wasnt even a place where abscence could be: this sort of nothing, or void, is given the term barren. And it is that pecularity of barreness which marks the objective investigation of what metaphyscis wishes to afford. The subject of death, mind, beginnig and end all lie here, and hold no care or concern for a priori reasoning. At the very least, all things that we know are bound within entirety, and bear the terms existence, reality, objects,  things. It is what is outside of entirety, or what is not, that holds our boldest regard. "For just as there may be no fish on a plate, but a plate, so may our thoughts actually be of something when we regard the void outside of abscence: which to me, better reflects our limitations of thinking, and their ultimte quality of referencing something. Metaphysiucs then feels like the real mind forming tactics, which itself compares to the organ of our skin and nerves repealing away from a flame: in that for each, they are born and productive of something real. By that, our regard for the void is but a fabled sort, and by that, we are tasked with the prospects of furthering our physical vocabualalry: as to at least no what the void would mean. All though, while we remain reproached; or in rather, to that which is out."

<div id="rightofgood">
   Simply, we are a man, which means that within a free state, we still employ reason. This remarks Plutarch's sentiment, 'that when young folks lose the shackles of their parents and adulthood, that the release is not into a realm of lawless frolicking, but one in which reason is their guide'.
   <br>&emsp;In that, I see that as we are free, so do our senses and touch bend; and by that, we are no longer in a state of fear or obligation, but curisoity and amends. In effect, desire comes to fruition; which contrasts with a lower state, wherebby the removal of things -ie. struggle and distress- covers our aim; while in this forward case, obtaintment and progress marks our gain.
   <br>&emsp;Notably, the proclivity of these interests can be so, that in our varying states, the prominence of one weighs agaisnt the other. For a basic example, if you spend your time eating and indulging, then your time spent reading and pondering will have that dragging by your side. "Almost as if your free time is committed to both; yet in each, you cannot be fully at rest, as the attention to one brings you away from the other." The experience which comes to mind actually, is when passion raises my time, so are those things of a creamy and wonderous sort perked up. Which pulls me against our dispostion to things on the alternative side to these things; at least, because our real truths are not so privy or keen on those other, so are we left in a state of stiltedness, as our passion in fact urges us towards those things which we are otherwise disposed against.
   <br>&emsp;I can say, merrily, that freedom is our life, and by that we are at liberty to elect where we go: as if our ends were in and of themselves. The thing, is that certain conditions remain beneath the more common sentences of our civil life. Which is to say, that if  we were given financial soverignty, so would our health continue its need of treatment. Forgoing that has neccessary effects, and in a way, muddies our otherwise fortune. Personally, the eveness and strenght that comes from such regards, merrits itself by those qualities and their persitence amidst our time. Consequently though, our more active and liberal interests flourish, or at least solidify themselves under such roots. And by that, I'd say that our very body holds us accountable to it's needs: and, regarding our civil freedom, so are we without suffrage to the formers demands: nor can we emmigrate from its torment. And, to compare, our mind and its own bevy of nourishments is in no way different when it comes to the constancy of its demands, and our branded station. 
   <br>&emsp;This is actually a rewarding thought, for I need not complain or compare our interests with those that have little congeniality with the roots of health. Nor our wholesome regard and sensibility at that.
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, in my active way, we still have rules and consideration within such a lane. Not only must we maintain and settle into those core needs, but so must we deliberate and reflect as to the fruits we wish to sprout, and thereby the means in which we'd produce them.
   <br>&emsp;In our own case, the timidity to apply ourselves in that far latter, is the grueling subtelty that pulls at our time. As withut that clear resolve, so are we left without the gains and or momentum of a forward motion, and alongside this the contentment and committment to live in such a kind and particular way runs out, as the pull from ahead slackens our foundation. With all to much experience I've noticed that this softening effect hurries me to forwardly respond; yet by that, we are either brought so through things which rile our passions -which are themselves sirens to our fiddiling ways- or we simply elect something as our choice for choice sake, and hastly run about: as if only to proceed. These leave me in nothing short of a depleted state, and eventually one whose ultimate stalement brings our suitabilities into a resting  state -by virtue of our brazen work- which, in effect, holds us back from the very progress and paces I relished making.
   <br>&emsp;The question for me then, is why are we falling back into states which draw a hastened response? I recognize the curse of the cycle, but my concern is the effect which iniates it. And I dont know explicitly, for in one sense, our tactics within our core amends is clearly off; but so might our strategy by equally off tiltered; whereby the amount of room to slip up is itself smaller. I'd say on the general end, that our life holds no dear regard. And in a similar way as we quote ourselves by the desires associated with our inner needs, so are we lacking in the similarly basic turths when it comes to family, society, religion and death. We spend so much time giving these the benefit of the doubt, or at least we dont conclude anything regarding them. Its as if the grammar of our lifes is so unset, that we cant quite say if anything we spell is correct; and by virtue of that, in other words, it is hard to committ to anything when the basis of your resolve has no syntax, or characters at that. And secondly, regarding the way we treat the life we've deemed acceptable, we still aren't perfect at that; as although we've made solid amends to remedy crucial oversights, so are we more or less subject to the way the times were before. This is circumstantial surely, but so are we are not respecting that, at least in terms of our needs amidst the lower stock (of that which we've admitted is important). And although we are doing fine, and our strategy may hold the ultimate concern, so are we living quite passively, if not ill-deliberately, in whichever strategy we have. It is true that without a general view of life which is proper, and amended to at least, then your tactics can only go so far, and remain consistent at that. But so can we do better, even if that meant we gave more time to overdue concerns. That is its own discussion, as is the solidity of our lives. But so ought we moderately proceed. "For frugality and being economical is more of a sense, whether your accounts are settled and flowing, or if your in debt, and shifting things around."

<div id="calmtosee">
   Dewscribing the truth is quite a hard thing to do. In that though, we are left with our common selves, which, oddly, measures up upon some thought, to the edge of what that truth is. I use the word 'description' then with much explicitness, for the trouble is not in the intuition of what is in fact true, but in saying it. This indeed comes from self regard, or at least the recognition of who we are and how things appear in our tightest state. By that, we are not driven to anything but the plain admittence of our physical mind, and our otherwise composition of matter and their output of words. Behaviour and the underlying neurology best explain this, and by that, our speech and reflection fit; that is, as the sun cam together by the swirling massess of hydgrogen, and packed together of her debris is earth and all the microbial fuzz, so is our entire make up a mere progress of that. This seems fair, and in more than one way, is sound in both the entity and description. 
   <br>&emsp;As I said though, acting with what seems relevant, fairs much ease in deliberation, as I have no question of the reason or place in which I'd proceed. Only, when I do think of what is true, or at least affirm the basis for which my common actions rung, I am all to inconsistent in actually stating so. I suggest, consider and define, and as I just did, assign (or identify), but in this mix of meddling and or definite claims, I faulter, or at least I am all to familiar with an absent of thought and explicity. That is, we regard the irelevance of things beyond the real question of entirety; and by that, despite our reproach, we hold our personl makeup as nothing special, but a configuration like all others. Our even paces give us the ease to address things as so. But so in that admittence, and our further coloring of the rules and or reasons which govern our locality and content, the basis dissolves away. Which, as I've come to known, or can consider, is that if the nature of such principles is not one that compares to the lineage of judgement or salvation, then not much is really worth our regard. It is like worrying about the current of a stream, and where you will go when on it; when in fact, recognizing that there is one and your place is one it, bears an indifference to the fact that wherever you go, the stream will take you: and that this is true, by the nature of the stream. Sensibility would ascribe that you just be then, while the percieved truth of the matter is not one that holds you under much account: as the one who'd be judging affords nothing more than the impression onto you, or at least conditioning; and, accordingly, your response is one which cant help but align, or at least get comfortable doing so. Moreover, the ends of the stream percieved by those who have settled into a state of merry rowing, is not one in which waterfalls seem perilous, or a dark lagoon as an alarm. Whether the currents are rapid and rough, so is there nothing but your resitance to rowing, which excites any real concern. For in truth, is that upon your merry row, the end which is known is a state of nothing; as if the stream will continue while your drift away. "And such a state is not so unpleasant to one who is calm enough to see it."

<div id="fullmystery">
   I dont know why the description of providence and rest is required? It doesnt change how we pay our taxes, nor is it neccessary that we warrant the benefits of a friend.
   <br>&emsp;I think what has happened, at least with the notion that the basics of our life is off, is that the past holds not but lineage, and within that a broader substance than what is current. Only, the contemporary view holds more credit than those from antiquity; yet, resolving to it feels off, as the immaturity of it leaves it exposed to elements which the other side clearly addresses (however wrong); and at the very least, you have less to address yourself. In that, you are outside the commplacency of mindless folks and those of a poor yet severely resolute kind. Your alone onto this accurate path. 
   <br>&emsp;Part of oour reflections then, or regards, is how what the subjects of such route entail, are in need of definitions, as to not be but the idea which this path remarks, but its substancte. For we ultimately are left in this state which is all to apprehensvie to advance; but fetters as our suspended state no longer tilts forward, and theres nothing to hold us from falling back. The negative expereince which arises holds me to the count, of giving our post a more clear direction. For any path your on becomes easier to amend, as the actions which the fruits of such path promise, become easier to achieve as your steps bring you closer to it. "As with any skill or trade." 
   <br>&emsp;I remark though, that even in our triumphant place, we are but held by the principle truths in which our placement's set. By that, we are not so solid as to have cemented the merrits or reason of such place; but the natural efficacy of it comes from the inherient sensibility in which said truths are founded. Within that common yet lush state, I see that what is going on around me, is a realm which is common in the most general ways, but therein limited by the expected edges of those who are not so deliberate. While, on the outside, sits those who are deliberate, yet of that there is not much more than the roots of theism and philosophy. Plato and Aristotle hold one, while Christ and the explicit reasoning of the supreme hold the other. These are old however, and their merrits continue to wain. At least, their additions are not really present within the current realm, and by that, those who even add the modern discovery, do so on foundations which are not in themselves modern. Besides Chomsky and his developments of language, there is far from any remarkable thought. There is no Hegel or Kant in this day, nor is Nitzche, Hume, Rousseua or Spinoza present. There are humors which compare to those, but nothing so vastly and intelligently marshalled. Our own merrits even dont amount to what those produced; as we are but on a road that is based on accuracy; yet of our validity in doing so, or success that is, and the basis for our direction at that, is at most in a maturing state. 
   <br>&emsp;I feel thus alone, as none are asking questions, but saying nothing, heeding the voice of others, or building on what is at this point ancient. The simplicity though of what we wish to say is such, that our charter is not one where all must be reinvented, but refined. The questions of those before us was not ill placed, but the approach held to much formalitiy and measures for judgement that the reality of the world in which it thought to describe could respect. This may be a fine critique, but is in no way a correction; that is, we hold no certain truth by which there own is measured against. But I say, that all those who we'd deem rational, hold no legitimate concepts or actuality (of what they reason as possible) on the basis of how the world's currently known. I dont have much vivacity in temrs of logic, but I do have the sense that A) a premise needs to be legitimized itself before the use of it amongst other premises can produce anything more than valid: as we wish the most for something sound, and B) that of the reasoning which one has, and the grandeur in which its maxims flourish about, holds no ultimate sway when the existence that those basics refer to in terms of actuality in which there core reasoning means to explain, is baseless by the neccessary reproach within the present model. 
   <br>&emsp;In short, space is not itself a void, nor is the notably uncertain effect of gravity without a associate who is known to an even lesser degree. That former namely, but including those  latter two, makes the objects and concepts regarding all things appropraite to the apparent existence -to us that is- holds no definite identity or way in which we can theorize a priori for. As, for instance, a bachelor is surely one who is not married, and before confimring whether dave is one or not -and his according situtaion- if we know he is a bachelor, then we know by definition that is not married; for whether we confirmed it or not, we'd know that the status of his marriage would make what he is so. By that, all is possible in fact, but so does the latter come by the givens that the former supposes. Only, a bachelor is a man, and a man is a configuration of matter, which itself holds material origins. And if identification of matter is itself unknown, then how can we principally declare what a bachelor is. For we rest so easily on existence being what it may, but doing so in a way that our logic can align with. "Again, on the basis of possibility." But how can we suitably known what our presumption would offer, that is, how could we rely on the possibility of something, when no thing is known. We say, that if such and such happens, then so will this amount; but if things in themselves are beyond our definition, then what strenght is there in what we suppose. One might say that exprience rings the bill, or at least by virtue of terms derviced from common occurences, we can still say that some fact will fit, or be irrelevant. My point, is find me something which is not in association within this limited domain; find my a concept, or term that is, which has its derived presumptions from something other than the domain of unidentified things? Typically logic breaks down into characters, which are themselves sufficient without the prescence of things. "Mathematics works this way in some sense." And perhaps all this does is render us in an imperfect doubt; for we may know how anything would be in any given case, but never are we sure what a thing is. If this is so, then we are best to live another way, for we are indeed the ones who are skeptical. But so does this run in contrast to the given desire and ends which other's maxims are established towards. And fairly, if one is more appropraite then so ought we amend to its lane. 
   <br>&emsp;What I test upon you is in the avoidance of seeing something as uncomparable to your mind, and by that, if all things were in doubt, that as your hand and heartbeat would be, so would your facutlites of the mind and its products be too. There is no retreat into a thing which is ultimately so. There is nothing if the present of any thing is in doubt; for we can at least be sure when no thing is known, that nothing is present.
   <br>&emsp;What I believe, is that the truth lies in that, and is more pleasant and aptable then the sweetest fruits of a definite (and commonly sold as non ending) existence. 
   <br>&emsp;What nothing is though holds an interesting sway. For a rock is quite different than the purest void. And, at the very least, on the simplest scale even, there are varying atoms. And the question, is if space itself is not barren, and all things atomic are mere extensions of that, or accompanyments at least, then where do we in fact stand, as a homogenously sourced batch of things, by which the root (being something, as perceived) is in fact nothing? At least, how is the nature of matter and cheese what it is as something farily deemed something, when nothing is in fact all there is to know? Is the void sucking us in? Are we flowing out? Or maybe our view of the void is to bent on the mistakenly viewed emptiness, which itself is but an abscence amidst of a mold, or a plate we'll say; where the void is barren, in that it is not a mold which something is simply not present, or inhabiting. Truly a delicate question, as the vocabulalry holds the attributes of both a skeptical and physical kind. But in that way I dont mind, as I am simply unadorned with any support, as to remain questionable of our existence but all while remaining as I ostensibly am, all while were seperate to the inaccurate neccessity of thing's prescence, and the presumptuous givens of what is in fact not pricnipal -and thus an appropraite maxim- all under the misplaced wish, and assumed preference of ends that are in accord to existence; when the truth, is that either existence is not so and thus the ends derived from such are misplaced, or, that if there is a kind of existence, that the nature of that amidst the vastness of space holds no neccessary sway for an end which is of peace: and in that, I say that nothing else is needed for my place in existence to be favorable in the way that its natural. "for who would have peace, and effectively forever so, and think that a nature ordained and privilaged for that, was poor, off, wrong, and otherwise the remark of heretical and or mean thinking. I think all thinking of a provident and or solidified sort (regarding existence) seeks such end anyway. And all it has failed to do is see that nature amidst her unsolid ways, still offers us that. For the abscence of mind is not worth being apprehsneive about, when the nature of it is more or less the same (without it) in existence or without. For you are in effect with not: and thus peace is yours for all time: and effeacaitvley nothing other when time ends."

<div id="termsforsoil">
   I may ultiamtely have a final position, which is itself appropriately absolute, but generally we remain on a route of skepticism.
   <br>&emsp;Foremost, is this the fact due to the very nature of things which we seek to inquire. For starters, the basis by which reasoning comes from, in terms of ideas at least, holds no reputable sway when it comes to the reality of things. It is not that we are soley mistaken, and have concieved of things different than what they are, but that such measure of what things, is unknonw; and by that, no premise can really be laid, for not space, origins or time can be mentioned as concepts within the complex of reasoning, for these things are, more or less, clearly of existence: and in that unknown. That is a crucial thing at least.
   <br>&emsp;Secondly regards a bevy of mental limits, whereby our natural bandwidth cant simply comprehend the most complex things. By that though, we merely need terminology that best describes the properties of things; for in that, we can better propse what the base layer is, and otherwise how it moves and comes to be. The point here compares to that almighty question of soul and substance, or, in a modern sense, the line between void and nothing. On top of that, is the actual regards for the swooshes, and in other words innate propensity for movment by these finest strands. For, one of the core issues of physics, as I see it, is how common matter acts the way it does, but unclearly from a source (which itself is equally unknown). This brings the element of mind and will, as if the soul which matter rests on urges it; and by the movements of that, mechanics arrive. Yet, albeit fair and plausible that there is some sort of urging basis, that the actually twists and twirls at levels inferior to particles, is quite ill defined. And my point, is that if you consider a body of water, and how its surface holds the choppiness of waves, and below there swoons the currents and tides, that with such common sentiments at our disposal, we can better regard how all layers of matter act; at least, if we have more refined and bolstering notions that reflected different temeprs of motion, so would we have more delicate terms to describe the equally delicate layers.
   <br>&emsp;For me, that is what skepticism is, in that we are without confidence and amends to a truth which our doubts confer. But, to that limit which our suscpions at best concern, so is the edge by which things are clearly known in need of our own descriptive ability for things at that edge. For it is one thing to presume a soul, or urging layer, by which all matter settles upon -and in fact originates. But, if the distance in which our regards are placed concerning the  edge of that basis to the point of where matter begins, is increasingly far from such edge, then our idea of matter and the basis will be off. That is all I seek to do, is push what is known against our suppositions. And, interestingly, is that as we make this advance, that the intuition of the base becomes clear; or at least an idea of it starts to form; and, such notion is one that seems to govern what our knowledge (or matter) is derived from. In other words, the further we press existence against the possibility of it, so does the actuality of it become a source in itself. "Whereby providence holds no more trace, or need."
   <br>&emsp;For me, the most usefull element of our doubts comes into play. And that has to do with how we identify things. 
   <br>&emsp;Lets bring this and the prior notion together. There is an edge, of atoms well say, and within those lies the soul source; which, to reference Leibniz, urges, or initiates the atoms to move as they do, who upon their mutual interactions with eachother, produce effects of a mechanical sort. And again, we assume this edge, or soul rather, as the motion of matter seems impossible to explain without something to begin it. Only, we have made a crucial error in this. One that remarks that limit of concepts due to our limit of understanding the matter they reflect. Only, in this case, the general notion is that things which are labelled ostensively, are not entities in their own right. As concepts they may be, as of things and their relevance to us, so are the mechanics (so to speak) clear and thus identifiable. Yet, as things, they are unknown on the basis of what any thing is. And by that, we have the peculiar idea of ostentation, which is to say that green paint is (upon inspection) blue and yellow paint together. As an idea, or subject as we say, green paint is, or green at that; but as paint, it is really just a mix of blue and yellow; and by that, there is no entity which we'd describe as green paint. It is more or less an illusion in a practical sense. Even then, is there blue and yellow paint? For upon inspection, it is not so that these are made of other mixtures. Only, if we look beyond the sentiment of paint, we'd find that what makes the blue blue, and yellow yellow, is the configuration of atoms, and the way that light bounces of that as to create a blue and yellow effect. "Which, to reiterate, combines together to create the appearence of green: but not even of a configuraiton which is anything more than the reflections of the structure of blue and yellow." 
   <br>&emsp;My point, which to be clear does not end here, is that as green is not so, for it is in actuality blue and yellow, so are each of those  latter really a batch of atoms. In terms of green not being so, this is very much an illusion on the forefront layer. Just as flour, water and yeast subject to heat, creates the crustiness of bread. But of those ingrediants, or parts -which, together, are but altered from heat- so are the components of that made of components themselves. And by that, bread is but a mixture of the atoms (whose configuration) we call flour and yeast. Even heat, in a molecular sense, is but a transfer of energy (in a vibrational sense) to those vibrations within the atom. And my point, which again is not done, is that as bread is ostensivley heated up flour and yeast, so is flour ostensively molecules of glucose, which are themselves adjoined atoms of carbon and oxygen; and these, are but bundles of protons and surrounding electrons; and that former at least, is a bundle of quarks. And I say with great skepticism, what are quarks ostensively; and in other words, what blue and yellow paints make the green of quarks so? The notion of space comes into play, and the fair inquiry regarding dark matter. But these are more like supports to our plea of being skeptical: for of the soul which we suppose, be it the source of bread, atoms or particles, so is the thing which it is the basis for unknown. 
   <br>&emsp;And, as our core address, that as we further define what that thing is, or at least what lies on the side of matter at the edge of it and soul, that such refinement and inquiry would perhaps render the idea of 'soul' mute. And that because this line by which the true parts of things comes to be fits within the mystery of barreness and abscence, that the former may in fact be nature, while the latter and its occasioanl residents, may be but incomplelety, or at least unsolidiy destined, as their source and ends are acquited and in accords, to the void in which their aligned. 
   <br>&emsp;That notion, of space and its residents acting how they do amongst nothing (or the void) is the goal of our description. For even if all was in fact real and solid, contained, how could there be any place where something was not? Where is that edge, and if so, how is it that there is a difference of sides? Would the tide of nothing not wash the sands of the other away? And in that sense, we need a better picture of what entirety could be; for as I see it, it is really our ideas and concepts which identify things only ostensively, and rear the all to common conundrum of what the unviverse is expanding into; or at least, if the complex of things was so, then where does it lie in? And our notion of ostentation is such, that without the proper terms of doubt, then we may confuse the void in which the mould (or floor) of things is held, as a location itself. And that, if we then say, 'well, of that floor, its the soul which acts as the source of that: the basis for the empty plate'. And all I would say, is that we need a compliment to that certain something, in that the existence which we deem sourced from the soul, or mistaken as being within something also existent, that 'existence' may be something else, and not entirely solid and real as we suppose: and my arguemtn for that, is that the merrits for beleiving otherwise comes on the fact that soul (or infinity) are but presumed beginnigns for the existence that we believe is so: yet, if that existence is really not, then would the void of soul and infinity not fit that? Could there be not soul or inifinity if existence was really not? And against your impression that it clearly is, I say show me, define it for me, tell me, 'when space is something itself, or at least not void', that your identity of things is so? For if space is equally something as a rock, then the greatest mistake is made, in thinking that existence (or things) is everywhere, for where is space not? But I believe that we have floundered into the gravest error: for my belief, is that if something is deemed to be everywhere, then where could nothing (or the void) ever be. And in that, at least, removes any possibility of a soul (or void), definitivey. But I indeed have no solidity of regard beyond this point, and must atually amend from this principles whihc I lay, as opposed to explaining: for, in practice, it is a back and forth of mistakes, made along the lines of our seeming to forget, or mistakenly assume that our conclusion of reality or not is wrong. And in that, I must identify that which is not knonw, to ask more questions about it. "for it is harder to say that an undefined thing does not exist than that it does. And saying that a definied thing does exist holds more credibility than that it does not (for it is defined). ANd speaking about that first point, is what is hard to know, but what our skepticism suggests: as all things other act as though things are defined, when they are not: and, through inquiry -being the adavnce amidst doubt- we move on. But not from here, as my brain is broken."

<div id="ourvalidity">
   I think that part of our discontent likely comes from the confusion of what our efforts are for. You see, the less I arrange our interests towards that which promises travel and friends, so do those outputs wain. And in effect, I cannot see them, as my effort doesnt excite me with their future prescence. 
   <br>&emsp;This is fine more or less, nor are the common bounds of our time exempt from these coming about. Only, in our current way, we wish to write; yet, such an interest is one of a natural gait, as opposed to finishing something. There are projects that I do, and in a way, they make me happy and solid -which itself confers literal and or percieved excitement. 
   <br>&emsp;But as we settle, or at least stop in moments of rest, so do those industrious paces wain; and their results seemingly follow. 
   <br>&emsp;This is fine though, as the flow of my life best describes our needs and interests. For the sun is high or covered, but so do we walk, move in the moring, eat appropriately through the early and mid day;and then we write alongside this, work a little perhaps, or play a game and watch a show. And this keeps going on and on, and generally with a wholesome heart and smile. 
   <br>&emsp;I only think that our forward efforts treat us nothing more than their inovlvment; and at least, their direct output is but promising, but never so rewarding. When we are left to ourselves then and our common pace, so is there not much we are obliged to which would give us a similar outlook. And this is fine, preffered even. For amongst our clarity, so is our happiness amidst others and the average time of touring a fair scale by which our time should be judged against. There are things I would like to do, and generally are approach there is coming out. But I generally live as though there is not much to gain, or anything which we are wrong to be doing, or avoiding at that. Theres so much buisness out there in the world, that acting as though you actions are respecting the complixity of that is poor; and if you did understand it, then you wouldnt feel so bad.
   <br>&emsp;Where were left though is a state of pure liberty. And perhaps, with fairness, in that which comforts this doesnt guarentee is not so barring of those comforts, but rather they have their particular grooves to come along, we are otherwise set amongst our ways, whereby time is not measured in rotating periods or days, but what is right now and proceeding. In that, there are things we know, and some things we could expect. But outside the way we spend our time, there is not much else but which we cling on to as to remedy what the lack of the former produces.
   <br>&emsp;In one way or the other, I am not interested in taking for granted the interests that we have. I wish to establish our point of view, charter the annals of man thorugh the fragments, be vulnerable and open in our approach of intimacy, and perhaps the time and confidence to progress through the toils of publishing. This is what I seek, and by most accounts, the impetus is in what we lack, as opposed to some hurdle that asks much of us to do. We just need to be ample and sharp, and let the years and our ways go on. We are fine right now; and less we make a hasty attempt, and following committment at that, so will our finer ways need to strenghten for those outer pleasures to be. Right now though, I am set in the openess of our ways, and calmly as the novel needs and anxious judgements from others is gone. All I need to do is procceed. And by that, establish the core of that: remarking upon it as if truly were our lane. And, as per all ends and their required task, so can we reflect on that, and marshal ourselves in a way that suitable. For, if our aim with respect to some profession, then our itinerary is most important; and within our actual employment, so would the needs of that seal our respect. When it comes to our interests though, they are very much of activity. As I see that writing and reading are at the heart of it, so ought our response be with respect to the vitality that they seek. And thankfully, or happily rather, I do this, for in that regal path, we earn the stability to do such things; but amidst this we earn the casual favor of leisure and rest. Moreover, as we generally advance in this vital way, so do the refinements of that offer us an innately preferred way to be. For doing yoga and things of that refined sort bear me a natural means of persitence, as our passive time even beenfits from us better sitting on the floor.
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps at the end of the day our fragments and outward invovlements are mere occupations; and merrited so on the basis of us needing to be occupied. Perhaps if we were much more forward and direct, as if our heartflet inerests held some immediacy, then we'd need these not. I dont think this neccessary though. For I invested in our scooter, some books, and things of the sort; and beyond our fear of losing money, the task of discernment was no toil. Similarly, producing more shorts, setting up a profile, or currating the means for publishing, are but simple tasks, despite their unknown end. I only mean, that as we stretch and run, and write, read and play alongside this, and do some chores at that, that taking the steps for those occupations is not so different; and at that, as the steps we take in our dearest ways comes naturally and gradually as our core is steadied, so do those other steps. For each, we need not worry, nor ought we press ourselves as if finihsihng is our claim. The project themselves are of their own accord, and what they require is one thing; but their is no time pressing on us; and by that, ought they be interests like all others, and come out without scarring us, through the field in which all interests are facilitated. They are great in there own way, but are substanital only as much as we put in. And considering their nature and our lack of confusion for what they should procurre in terms of place, holds no enormous weight on me to become something through those. I already am, steady and clear. These things are akin to chores, and otherwise resemble our daily lives and respect, whereby the percieved course of our lives amidst our civil lane is respected. And to those occupations you can treat as if they were that. But lets not confuse their purpose as bringing us out into that realm full and mightily. They are no produced in that way to begin with. Time and patinece can offer rewards, but these are elements on top of me, who is fine and happy to be where we are, and blossoming. Our fragments is important, in a way thats comparable to our website and network. And publishing and intimacy seem worthwhile; and at least, our means to procurre them is similar to our means to acquire work and stead. They are not so clear and cut as employment, but the steps required are commparable; and by that, of these richer rewards we can only try. And we have our sweets regardless.
   <br>&emsp;I think we just need to return to me, and focus on our being; as most things, be it personal or outward, come to fruition when you are well. And I know that not all needs to be perfect; or at least, it is our choice to offer effort which limits what we do, rather than being mistaken in that those things dear require an abandoment of those outer things. Emails and time is all thats required. And regarding passion, no matter; and in terms of its real good (as something is external), so is it the sun: preferable when up, but not barren while the moon runs high. And if the sky is covered, so are true to our ways.
   <br>&emsp;I see that you are skeptical, and by that we are not looking to prove, but find. By that, we have our anwser, and at any rate, can hopefully come at our other curisoities with a firmer grasp, and thus approach them out of desire, rather than a need for ceratinty or passion. And generally, this way is a remark of our right character, or one which is lush and robust. "For asking questions draws from me the most." In that though, there isnt much which I can complain when our treatment is such a character; as what comes naturally to it is swell, and in a way the driving force of our amends; but so to can you quell any uncertainty or stress, when the treats of being said person is fine innately. This is where the lure of leisure comes in, and that of people and family. For I seek not, frett little, and otherwise find meager means to advance ourselves advantageously. But I worry little about gaining that, in that it comes from desire and our ease of being vulnerable, of trying: travel holds no passion, nor that of friends. Lets be ourselves then. Or at least, reflect upon what it means to be that. And qualify yourself on what it means to be so simple, and fear not about judgement. We will leave if being ourselves runs antagonist to others hope of control.

<div id="thegoodwetend">
   So the basics are what give you a smooth life, in that the paces of it are withut trouble and pleasant. Then, as time goes on and this solidity of your remains, you find interests which reflect said grounds. Such interests then require their own deliberation or care. While, tending to the basics is more about sensibility and the refinements of that. While occupations and industry holds constructive regards: as the prior is about how you are, while the latter is about something your actually making.
   <br>&emsp;The question, is what happens when your familiar enough, or disposed atleast, to those basics, but begin to slip? If you are in fact engaged with higher efforts, what about those cracks below? As I'd put it, the soil is sometimes dry or full of holes, or too compact at that. While those further efforts have their own twists and binds; but, as I have found at least, that the driving factor for how we knot ourselves around such ends, is by the steadyness below. In retrospect, we've realized that the basics are all we need, for we are engendered with rational joy. But so are these things, seeing as their hearty in effort, can become bound for something other than our participation, when in fact the grounds which they sit on are unsettled. These projects then become as such, rather than activities; and our occupation is no longer a kind of effort but a profession, or at least an anwser to that which would respond to our core slump.
   <br>&emsp;This is the path we must tread though. For the basics are not so forgone, nor our sensibilities far off -and without room for ample improvment- when it comes to tightening loose ends. Nor, at any rate, ought we tremble upon our higher efforts, if in fact we let go of the reigns. Evidently the roughness which we'd tend to is already felt in the constricted promises from those higher efforts; and thus reproaching from those will see those promsies untended, but in need. But so can our dryed out ways be attended to immediatley, and by that the flarred up stakes will remove themselves. Moreover, we learn, about who we really are and whats important. And, as it were, the world in which we think was on offer for those hasty efforts, and otherwise the apprehension of missing out or feeling scrutiny about not meeting that 'oppertune way', not only looses its harsh glare, but encourages understanding by us; as if we truly were occupied and engaged, but through a world whos nature (we further understood) was in harmony with our steady intent. In that, the holes which we develop beneath, reaffirms the even grounds which are in truth fine and favorable: and our view of the world comes to be in a way which is congruent to that: at least, what we find favorable and true, is in line with the way the world really is: and such a way is not, or ever is, in the complexion that our haste and di-ease imagines (or commends).
</div>
<div id="timesbetter">
   I think when I consider success, it is not so much about what I get, but what I achieve; which, comapred to the actual profits of accomplishment, moreso remarks the actual triumph in the activity. For instance, I may achieve a new role at a job, and in that earn more money; and the money may be something you earn in its own right, but really it is what you can spend it on. By that, this promotion and the nature of its promise may spark in you the excitement for what such liberties will bring.
   <br>&emsp;Yet, in that, there is a scale called reason, whereby my measure for rewards is garnered by sensibility and due regard. This is important in times when success seems so appealling, but of a kind which would offer things that could remedy whats lacking. This to me is poor, as times where I am solid draw me to things which treat me to less mitigtaing ends, but flourishing ones. "Removing negativity compared to furthering yourself positively."
   <br>&emsp;I would say though, that our approach to considering success can include those things of a more thirlling and comfortable sort. But, whereas it may seem fair to start with those ends in mind, and by virtue of our oppertunity 'to do the most we can', we may dream further in terms of those ends. Yet, I would say that it makes more sense to start with what you have, and consider the success in front of you: be it near and present, or that which you can see coming. By virtue of that, we will be more clear and kept to the scenario that we have, and not linger off into fantasies which in fact reflect what we'd hope for beyond our current stead. Instead, with a requisite sensibility to your current condition and the peace which follows, we can see success as something which is coming out and as an addition to our steady self. It seems that our dreams otherwise come from a self which is fleeing, or unable to rest in place: and that seems wrong in both the heart of the issue, but also the evident destination in which you'd reach, and then be in need of rest there. Perhaps theres a generous capactity to life, wherein you gradually recieve things and find it naturally easier to be in place, but of fortune as compared to strict fortitude. I would say though, that waiting for things to be easy in order to be at peace, seems both unneccessary as well as risky, as until that point where fortune bears rest to you, further actions which come from the prior discontent may cause conseqeunces of their own; or, at least, you may find contrary proclivities to the rest which you really seek.
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, I am not saying that we are without need for discipline; for by oppertunity or impression, we see success around. But I find inherintly, that certain givens of a pivotal sort, keep me sequestered in the land of virtue and stability (upon their amends). Things that grow from here may be less explicity in there need as is the case for efforts of a promising comfort; but so does that core dispostion lean me towards the grooves of the former. And, perhaps to my overall point, that as one would have the peace and ability to address those more wholesome extensions, so could we address those of success: but from us, as stated.
   <br>&emsp;By that, I see that our content creation is coming along. Yet, I cant help but feel jealous; which is not to say envy, as I am quite pleased with our place and sincerity, and thus feel no need to bring others down. Yet, I look at them, some at least, and think, 'will I ever have that, are my efforts set for such ends? Are we confused on our path, in terms of what it will give?'. But none of this bothers me quite readily. There is perhaps excitment that naturally comes from doing something; and perhaps, seeing others of the same kind and their shine, makes me see the potential for us to reach the shame. In that though, our comparions can wear upon us, as our current stead fails under the light of the other. Progress does come, and in those states our pace affirms the end  of our course. Yet, when we arent making such evident gains, then we feel still, and in effect far away from those ends I seek. 
   <br>&emsp;This comapres to what we were saying, that as I generally ought to be sensible, and in that, and from the steadying effect, arrange and see things ahead from the point of me; that, equally, ought we see and arrang the ends of our project from the point of it. Because at the heart of this we want to be happy. And when I see someone who has alot of success, it is not their ability to travel or find comfort that begrudges me, but the fair assumption that their higher status makes them happy. In that though, we see that we just want our others to care; for in that, our ideas matter and we are deemed offical: like we matter. Overall though, we just want to be happy, and the more that this expands beyond our core contentment, so are there elements of excitment and pleasure which extend from that. 
   <br>&emsp;I think that judgement plays apart to, as we feel somewhat awry at merely being pleased with our efforts, and not reimbursed for the sake of some other end. Such ends feel novel, or at least beyond the realm of need. And the quality of our time does bring me the dearest of securities, in the roots by which our cheer is made. But bringing that to light makes it so, and we are in way substantiated in our wholer efforts. But ought it be more? For I feel that none really judge you, and that in regards to their judgement, you are fine to be with enough. It is only you who are swept away from being unhappy; and in that, as I see it, is because you are in fact not so engrained or established in your dearest ways. Working to make that so comes at a price though; for in the moments of discontent, whereby the wealth of success would be welcomed, so do our amends bring us to a point which offers nothing of the sort. We may along the line be warm and pure, but so much only as our paces and will provide. Otherwise, the common medocrity of your ways will remain somewhat present: and until such ways become more substantial and able to remain full in their selves, so will your time be inconsistent.
   <br>&emsp;That is the challenge though. To remain steadfast on approach to times better; or amend otherwise to ends which are remedying to the current moments of lack. "But of which time you get on arrival, I cannot say. Or at least, what I suspect is that you would be comparably discontent, but amidst your wealth, rather than rags. It is better to be cheerfull and in the reigns of the latter; and through this more personal discernment, and suitable amends at least, can such poverty become more amicable: all while coming from, centering around, and furhtering the range of your cheer. And who would care for any status of claim, if it did not hold such quality. Away with those boring Kingships."

   As an example, I asked someone whether I should move to the coast or the interior. They offered their reply, and I muddled over what they said. A short while later I was with some friends and I said, 'Man, I still don't know what to do, coast or inland!. My friend consoled me, telling me that it would be all right. I went on though, saying that I was not clear on the choices. Sensing I was frustrated, and having their own peck of gruff over our stirring, they explained that it was simple, inland or coast, thats all. "Theres no need to be overwhelmened," that claimed, the picks are laid out in front of.
   <br>&emsp;For me, this issue raises its head all to common. That being said, whereas in the past certain scenarios required a particular response, as in the case of our parents reprehending me, or at least demanding attention over our mistake, my reply was simply 'I understand'; while in this case, the response which best addressess my concern, is one of special clarity, whereby I'd say, 'I know what the options are, I am just not sure what each amounts to. Or better yet, when it comes to each and their particualr elements -the facts regarding them if you will- of them I am unsure'. 
   <br>&emsp;It is as if I said I wished to either buy a home up north or down south, but in my discernment I knew not the price. Better yet, if someone offered insight, or an oppertunity we'll say, as to choose one of those homes, still, would my decision find itself dragged by the lack of known price.
   <br>&emsp;And perhaps overall my gravest gripe with society is in regards to their all to common narrow mindedness, whereby the sides of an issue, or parts of a concer, are given details in terms of the according positions, but rarely to any depth in the actual members themselves. Were all to clear on who is involved with things, or that a certain event happened; but we know not where the opponents stand, in terms of their scenario amidst other scenarios; and regarding events, we see and react to one, but know not its place amidst others. And by that comes the all to painstaking reality of significance, which is to say, that a single death throughout the annals of time would hold warrant of concern and amends: but so is this relatively insubstantial. And by my view, there is no common sense as to the difference between these two.
   <br>&emsp;I know not what to say, as the whole world, or its elements at least, waiver to some extent under such consideration. But I can say, for instance, that regarding the quality of our time, that most things are signifianct; and that, for simplicity sake, we may divulge certain sectors within the domain of all our efforts, and by that hold the realms of leisure, industry, liberty and claim as relevant to us; and although the fruits of each are worth our time, and in that sense hold according good, so are some more substantive than others. Simply, if, across the realm of things, or other factors we'll say, that a particular memebr causes instability to others, this we will say holds contrariety, as it is in opposition to itself. With only this in mind, we can see that the value of things is fit for according judgements; as it is most certaintly true that our lives hold many elements, and perhaps even more when we consider what we are at our wills to achieve. And simply, I've recieved no impression outside of those long gone, who've given any comparable regard to things on the whole, nor, in our modern times, an ounce of discernment regarding the particular things relevant to us today.
   <br>&emsp;By that, I stand by Plutarch and Socrates, nor has Ruskin or Hume left the side of my heart and writing hand. But in our present case, which, historically, is one of vastness and variety, so is there little but the ignorance and naieveties born from the eras before us. "In a word, theres not even a sentiment of reason or consistency, nor any contemporary judgement." 
   <br>&emsp;At the end of the day, I stand as a man by myself, and am in no ways apathetic to our position outside the norms of the world. In that, I have grown to respect; nor have suitable means to find comfort and success left their climbing pace. Moreover, I would best describe myself as a subject who upholds their duty as such, but does so by the more focused efforts within solitude, and the natural felicity and kindredness that comes out. "Whether I disagree with other men, or another man, so would I die for them. Not without purpose mind you, nor am I so void of myself as to be sucked in by snetiment. But so, to those norms which seem off, or at least inconvineent to our ordinary self, I listen: and where it counts for those of all sorts, so do I act then -and respect those of times where such reality was more common." All I would say, is that we live within the world: yet, within that is housed the world of men. And again, I am one, nor am I void of its detriments and proclivitiy. But I do prefer, and at least find virtue and favor, in the unmitigated lands around. In this, I see others within the state, who know all but anything; yet, with opinions and flare they correspond, or at least flaunt accordingly. This is strange, as if I were looking into the looking glass, or at least was stairing at the nature of men from further back, while those further in held such tight glares, that they fell forward into what is in practically a close point by that edge. In this however, I feel my task, for without any sense of the world I am both ignorant and lost; yet, with  all my repraoch and ability, I am not like everyone else ticked off. All I have is the nature of the world and its evidence around me; while they hold what amount to gossip and gross impressions. Moreover, to those even more savy then me, do their accounts get tangled up in the knots of significance, whereby even the most relatively unimpactful thing gets perceived as rot. I, on the other hand, have a general knowledge which trails all the back to beginnings of time; proceeding to stars, geology, the beginnings of mammals and man, so, with even more prevlance, do I know the charters of the oldest world, antiquity, feudal times and the liberty were in now, that even if someone specialixed in such fairs, would hold so little merrit less the breadht of their wares was not accounted for in an impression of something particular. And by that, I see most people, young and old, with a very small scale: nor any short amount of dopes and pundants, who (in their capactieis) use it. 
   <br>&emsp;But where am I then, with all our far back views, and to a realm that lies, specifically past what most know and see, and generally beyond the immaturity of even adult men? I can say, that I know; at least, of what I know is essential to regard, as if parts of a mold, am I clear. But, where I stand then, is in filling out those spots, as to not be merely reproached and wise, but known, or defined at least. 
   <br>&emsp;For as I'd put it, the issues of the world is one of impressions; and by that, it seems that the words of CNN and the pulpit bear us impressions of gratuitous kind. In that, as a man, I recognize that we are not so exempt, depsite our content; for the world were in goes on to our concer, or direct effect. Our impact may be little, but we are not simply foreigners of another country, and thus without worry. My point, is that as much as I am fine and pure, then so will the mummblings of others not interfere; for I may in fact permit myself to be a man occupied with his will; and shouldering that with a deliberate approach to our duty, is a mere sensibility to the problems the world actually has, and the grant from those trying to solve it: which I then recieve. Only, if I am not so happy, for whichever reason, then the undefined parts of our mind will yeild to gravity, and implode. Restlessness is born here, as is a far reporach from the world. That is the place for cynics though; but I also wish to be a man. Of such recgonition though, I suspect and more or less see, that we are at the point where fingertips are required: which, in effect, speaks to the additions which could come, but also the more important note, of what your adding to. "And to all those rumbling about, with our own strenght I care not, nor am I without such vision: for in our grounds, were sprouting, and wisely too: and, in short, the turth which we've identified has pulled me forth, and served as a web to get wrapped around: nor is my steady heart aware of things which bother one who is otherwise not." Yet by that, I must let our own gratuity go: but I mustn't say that I know the nature of man: for, upon all our reckoning and dispute, have we just become: and thus from our first steps the past is so long, and thus hard to remember. "But I know that the right step which would have come from our more collected discernemnt, would produce a step which lived without such need: and as in those harsher days, where the wear kept me so aware and assessing, so has this true step brought me to a point worth respecting: I notice though that the toil is not done, as if our bones are still changing, and the muscles at that: yet, the direction and precipe of state, affords no worry or care to such ways -as if being shot felt tore us like a mere flesh wound, to which our expectation curried such delight, that we forgot to address the scrape at hand."

<div id="soul">
   For starters, the notion of mind is tricky. As, for one, is the soul that governs all objects varied in itself? Or, as the ocean is made of water, but ripples here and bellows there (in its waves) by virtue of its collision (within itself), so might the soul be universal, but create the variations we see objectilely, by virtue of the movements of those equal pieces moving against eachother. 
   <br>&emsp;I'd add that skeptically, the notion of the soul is finite, as we are in fact negating what, beyond a contrived will, the motions and configurations of the objects we see; as, all things of the soul moving identically, does not speak clealry to any collision. The moon for instance and its effect on the seas, tears different parts, in the sense of a particular point in which our eyes see, and the narrowing lines from top to bottom as the object is approached; that the moons force pulls not only through its unexact bounds (as it is a globe, as opposed to a point), but so to the water there and that over there, that even of the exact drawing force, would the directions in which the recpients accepted this and reacted, bare them according to such force with a bearing equally different as the line of force (between the moon and point of the sea) differed. Where is this central point then for the soul and its objects? The soul is the instigator, the house of the starting will? I cant say our current suppostions permitt a base which we'd refer to the soul, but was meddled with by some outside mind; the soul, in our skeptical stance, is what we grant on the basis of our limited objectivity; but of what is on the outside of such material end -or its bases and beginning- is the realm and or hand which such will or mind is refferred to. "For at that point, we are explaining the motions of things by virtue of the souls impetus, but in our ill-clarity of that, or inquiry at least, we mistake the soul as something which the eternal mind governed, which in fact is an error in equating the soul to what is more appropriately deemed an object." We guarentee no edge, nor a creator; but if we do, we are clear on the contrivance of it all, and the arbitraty nature by which things act mechanically. The intent of the origin may be what we suppose, but so is the act of starting not revlant, or comaprable at least, to the more ostensible beginnings of mechanical force. 
   <br>&emsp;All I have are questions though, for how is there indeed a difference of souls, or variation at least? Perhaps, as I beleive in addressing so with any argument of it being neccessary -and the according mistake of defining it to objectively- that we are in fact at the point whereby the idea of the soul is poor. Our limits in mechanics may not explain themselves, nor any sounder notion that is comparable to the soul but holds more appropriate claim is present; but we can say that of the things in which our explanation means to say, so can we be clear on that. 
   <br>&emsp;Yet, I can only come from this sketpcially. The point I wish to make, is that the soul is not varied; or at least if it is, then we musn't mistake the way that it is for something which is best explained by mechanics. I seek clarity of this though, for there is the consequent view that our minds are of a differnet sort when it comes to the soul: as it the matter, or subject which our mind equates, is not merely a configuration of a the universal matter or soul, but is born of a different soul. 
   <br>&emsp;I might describe our inquiry like this. If we believe that the mind is born not of matter, or at least is of something unwordly, then equal to our interest in explaining the origin of rocks, so will we wish to explain the roots of our mind. Only, when we look at rocks, and our bones for that matter, we something hard, definite, composed of material; and be it the soul and the basic pieces who react upon its will, or a natural flow of things born of a reality which is itslef limited, so are we clear in what anwser our claim would reflect. Concerning the mind though, we because we deem it of a different nature then rocks and bone, then so do the anwsers we seek find themsevlves as such. 
   <br>&emsp;This is the crux of inquiry then, and in many ways holds us accountable as men. For by definition we are so, and not Gods who already know; for as I would declare, and burn those who deemed otherwise, that what makes us the creature we are, is in our attempt, and maturity to recognize our course as such, in asking, and doing so with accuracy and cheer at that. 
   <br>&emsp;Such a limit then, which again marks us as men, earns us the favor of defining things in the most speculative sense. However, I make a modern distinction; one of which implodes upon the very insight in what being limited means. Simply, if I see a miracle, then I'd believe that the occurence was born of God; for in that, by the rocks and birds I see, I know not much which is unnatural about that: while those walking on water or turning rocks to wine, is unnatural -super as they'd say. And what I'd propose, that on the merrits of the mind and its immateiral view and the granted case for a reality, or bend of the soul one makes such immateriality such, warrants miracles and mysteries to be seen as equally so. In other words, we may see mystical occurences as evidence of something else; but my proposal is that we merely see this as a different aspect of entirety: the comparison being the aspect which  bears things we see as normal. The point, is that in that variety, entirety is whole. "Just as man is whole and solid, but made of organs and parts."
   <br>&emsp;I belive that was muddled, but my offer is made. Do we, simply, take what we believe to be true, on the basis of what entirety is as we'd derive from evidence? Or, do we confess to knowledge that is born by confirmation, which is to say that we believe entirety to be a certain way, by which evidence confirms. For my belief, is that we deem our mind and miracles to be spiritual; but that this is so for we believe entirety to be goverend, if not at least partially as so. And in a way, our mind and miralces seem but affirmations of that: or at  least instances and things which fit the world we already suppose.
</div>
<div id="ofwholesandways">
   Skeptically, I look at the evidence born by objects, and decree that the explanation for such things is unknown. Moreover, as our investigations have occured, of those I can not truly identify. "For as it stands, the emptiness of space is not truly so; and by that, it is neither a void, nor strictly the layer in which we'd say 'empty'."
   <br>&emsp;In all of this though, the theory of such mysteries is left unclear. I am not a true skeptic, as I believe our understanding of things can become fully known; but as for now, where I lye in mere doubts, do I advance skeptically.
   <br>&emsp;However, in this approach it is right to presume the character in which the truth would be; and by that, at least for our own inquiries, can we say, that all and any lies within entirety. Existence to be clear is more along the lines of actuality; while possibility, or the arbitrary goverance and initation of that, is but a mere supposition. In other words, outside of what is real, lies the limitless will, who by mind or mechanism produced the seeds of existence. 
   <br>&emsp;I must be clear though, that within my reproach, and the according skeptical steps, do I merely suppose that of all things, that they either explain themselves, or are in some ways arbitrary in their origins: but within that, be it object and soul, or pure object, so entirety is all. 
   <br>&emsp;In my view, the latter notion is likley, if not possible; and because I dont know, and am thus skeptical, I offer the difference in what I know about objects and what I do not, under the supposition of the soul -or something arbitray. But my approach, as my belief and according aim reflects, is to push what is known against that supposed edge, and reach, as I conceive, a point whereby all which we see is made and goverened innateley. A mighty point does arrive, in that, more or less as we see it that objects interact via and to the effect of mechanics, and that of such relations that innately they are made, that so of this is entirety the bound of all, or domain at least; and, of such entirety, ought it be present to all there ever could and has been. "Hath possibility come from nature, and to that the outputs of real things, would such possibility still lie in the realm of being, which is to say not a void."
   <br>&emsp;On one hand then, we have the possibility that entirety is without bounds, which is to say, that off the things we see (or existence), that the roots of such is born of something eternal and infinite. That, or existence and its possibility are the same, or something of the sort; and however you'd place it, so is the possibility, or roots at least of the objects we see, limited, or un eternal as we'd otherwise see.
   <br>&emsp;If that is more or less true, as two sides to the same entire view, then I would say there are two interesting points: one being the identity of nothingness, and the error in believing otherwise by virtue of confirming what you already supposed.
   <br>&emsp;Simply, if I can define, there are those who see the world, and consider how it came to be; by that, there view of entirety is one that is derived from the outputs of it. "As if we saw a flower, and considered how it was made." While, on the other hand, there are those who suppose -heavily I'd add- how entirety is, and then see things which correspond with that, verifying their view. Miracles work both ways here, as one may have an inherint belief, then see something beyond normal and claim, 'wow, a sign, it is true!'. While on the other, by virtue of our own granted slice of supposition, we may deem apparent miracles as mere evidence which needs explaining; and by that, we may say, with some conflict between the sides of thinking, that what would cause such a miracle is so and so. This is better, though with some more thought we can see that the mix of confirmation and exploration are both knotted and maligned. Morever, as were on this note, is that, while a rock may exhibit explanations fitting for something so lifeless, that our mind and intuition may exhibit less strict properties, and thus according explanations. In this comes the odd idea of different kinds of souls, as if different seeds which bore different objects. I would say though, that this notion is quite unfounded in the develomental sense, unless one believes that there sat a layer of soul that was activated upon our minds introduction, or our being at least. This is quite odd, and whithering in its merrits.
   <br>&emsp;Secondly, and most hard to define, is the idea that all may not in actuality be so, and is in fact a birth from nothing struggling to be; and by that, the movement we'd deem forward and thus intial to our current advance, is more like a recession; which itself, as a form of magnirutde, or relative motion at least (being away in some sense), births a trajectory that the laws of physics which we know could work from. On one hand, is that origin, which is comparable to quicksand and a stake used to prevent motion; but in that resistance lies the friction that motion originates from. That, or nothing is not happy to be so, and wishes to become something; but in that, there is resistance to be something too. Or, nothing is so hard to be, that as it tries to, things get pushed aside, or out we'd say, as their implosion is resisted. 
   <br>&emsp;Quicjly, there are too primary points born from this, one being the explanation for physics, and the other being an identity of entirety. Simply, I believe, that by the simple intracies of basic motion, that over much iterative interaction, that the complex things that we see can be made; and by that, all that is required is a base motion: which, like the ocean, can act indiscremiantly of other points, but within a domain, or body of other points, who, in what we could suppose as slight differences in magnitude (or a supposed direction), that such a basic nudge thats not paralell to another, creates a difference and thus proceeding compounding -of which our current actions came to be. Secondly, is in the limits of this motions, or at least domain in which they rest in. For, the nature of nothing may be everywhere; and by virtue of the universe being but invisible past the farthest light its produced, so could there be an eternity of which this natural nothing resides. There are some descriptive fallacies that occur, but another alternate view, of a limited sort, is that, of this root place in which the basic nudges are made, so could that, being all in entirety, be inside the bounds of what is elsewhere barren. And by that, there may be an inherint limitedness, or shortness to entirety, and that our view of its limit and place is but an illusion, or vulgarity in description, of what is in fact only partially, if not soon to be not so. "At least, there may be nothing except that which is struggling to be so; and the ends of that, as we'd commonly say, may never be reached, as perhaps such a struggle will never end. But so is the realm, or void in which nothing is otherwise kept from being not, truly so: meaning we are but partial things -of a struggling sort- amidst a barren void. Which, to be clear, contrasts the otherwise view that nothing (and its possible, if not universal) struggle is eternal and through." What I reflect most kindly on though, is that my place in recgonition, is not much different than the parts of a plant which work its way towards the suns draw: and that by that, so are my own faculites and maturity pleased with nothing: whether that be eternal, or barren. "Who, would even care if they were eternally nothing, or outside of possible abscence? In my mind, the place and according ends (as'd be conceived) fairs not much more than a monkey: the difference being, that of that primate, rational am I, aware that I am."

<div id="susceptiblepast">
   Two things come to mind, one being the annals of man, and the oddness of supposition.
   <br>&emsp;For one, we must address the fact that 10,000 years is quite a long time. And in regards to man, his truest ancestor is nearly 300 of those intervals away. As of late, we have employed our industry and craft, but so are we of the same make as those who begun such venture. As we go through the periods prior, so we see that our nature, or configuration rather changes, till at least that moment where Erectus split from the more earthly primates. But so in the periods which followed then, was there much which changed; and in that, I feel that theres few reasons to suppose that our behavior, speech and according thinking didnt come about. "It might have indeed taken us 10,000 years to say the, and another to say dog, but so upon the year following would our otherwise oohs and awws -which monkeys make upon there own expressions- be made in such consonant ways: but so we could point to the dog." And I believe that much has happened in such means of idenitification, and that the ability to address things came long before the figures which we'd say hold our current roots came to be. And what I wonder then, is by whichever course of development, did we reach a point where our experiences led us to believe that our minds and the worlds workings was both governed, and seperate between that which goverened and the objects subject to it. I simply dont know.
   <br>&emsp;But what I believe has happened, is that as children have impressionble minds, so too were the ages of man comparably susceptible -be it of his own workings, or the mere grandeur of nature, and its according reveal as our senese grew in acuity. The conseqeuence of this though, is that those, more or less, poor impressions, acted as points of evdience, and accordingly shaped our view of the world. Now, in even the most ancient of times, are we more sophisticated in our superstition, elaborate we'll say. Yet, my feeling, is that those beliefs are the result of confirmation of the supposition that is rooted in those old beliefs. "By that I mean, that augurs, mystics, preaches and saints, held part of their appeal and recognition on the dissemination and or proofs of things people already believed." In that, we'd say, that of the truth they are but confirming, rather than exploring based on unprejudiced evdience.
   <br>&emsp;I'd say we are brought to our known conundrum, that of those who appeal to the appearnece of reality in the soundest way, and build their view of the world by the suppositions that reflect that accurate aim, that the stains of miracles and intervention burrow their way in as things of an evident sort. And, as we say, rocks have their according course of explanation, while someone turning water into wine has its own. Only, I believe, that by virtue of the common notion of a witness' general unreliablity, and the otherwise confusion for things that are as unidentified as comparably common things -ie., our basic mind and the act of a medium- that such awkward occurences are but mistaken truths of something which is not miraculous in the way described, or beyond natural at that. This, admittedly, as a sketcial take on the merrits of being judicial, and the doubts that such the accounts for such miracles and interventions are given with such fidelity. And I dont mean to be cynical, or scornfull that is, but by the point I already made, that both ones care and notion that such supernatural things ought be verified, as such things make the nature of things weird, so does a prior supposition that nature is of such supernaturla ways, or at least possible and or chartered as being so -on account of other supposed miracles- that such current divine acts are not awkward in any sort. "For in truth, they are not enlightening into the nature of things, by confirmations of the view already knonw." Amd the regression of that is one of increasing fraility.
   <br>&emsp;Its simply hard to be around people who find congruence and contrariety on the basis of old ways, and accordingly the vulagr roots of that. "In a word, people are either dreaming, walking with their head down, strutting with their head held overly confident or high: and nearly none have any reproach, as to not be so sure, or critical, but doutbfull, curious, inquisitive, skeptical. By the virtues of rationality, of which we as creatures are of the sort, being so explorative and in an integral way, marks us being truly so: for, we are more less the rational animal, and as a saw is virtuous by its functioanl demand of being sharp, that so to are we in our ratioanilaity, virtuous by the functional demands of that; and so much as we are, maturity is our claim; and as one who is brittle and of vice is no whole or true way of a thing, so are we, with all our sensibility and felicity, complete, found, warm.... a man."

   Lets detail this out. There are the misfortunes of the world and within life; meaning death rates amongst children, or those infected with measels, or the impoverished and or victims of civil cause. Then there is danger, be it civil (as in homicide) or from combat -as a result of governments deploying their offenses or defensese. Lastly, and worse understood, is the predictions of our time ahead; which, in most ways, comes from our modern scenario. Namely, these amount to the indefinite and mystical view of AI and machines, the ultimate yet impractically (at least by the given clarity so far) use of nuclear missiles, the appropraitely concerning view of climate change, but its poorly described result, and the otherwise risk of a meteor impact. 
   <br>&emsp;Personally, this latter section is riddled with suppostions that remedy the certainty of pundants and fools: but so, like in most cases, dont I know. That is the future though, and for the most part these issues can be better stated upon the world as a whole. And by that, beyond the conflicts between governments and those iniated for such cause, there is not much more than the common rungs of life, and all its expected and or inefficient problems.
   <br>&emsp;My place as a man then seems unclear. For I am in many ways responding to the thin and rampant views from others, who come from points of ignorance and no sense; and such impressions by me lead me to deal with the irritation. As, per whats common, I simply remove their argument; as under the suitable suppostion, there view comes mightily short. This is a restless approach though, for in our particular modern scenario, so are there many expressions of that sort being brought forth. "And it is not always our place not to listen." Instead, I find, and accordingly seek, the actual knowledge which our suppositions are based on. Notably, the concenr of violence is so ill put, that our selection of knowledge in fact bears our suppositions against those who ignornatly plead; only, the solidity of such knowledge is neither deep nor encompassing; and so by that, despite our fit confidence, so are we without solid ground. Secondly, remarks nuclear warfare, and our admittedly fair yet quaint understanding of its nature and effect; which, accordingly, leaves us with less supposition, and thus less to go against those who ardently propose. This is fine in many ways, and for the most part the issues of AI and climate find themselves similarly. But so is this result one of non-invovlemnt, as opposed to the more present yet rugged engagement regarding our common lives. 
   <br>&emsp;As a skeptic, my belief is not that things cannot be found, only, of the approach I believe there is more that needs accounting, and thus our paces should amend with an according doubt (or reservation). Similarly, my brief understadning and overall sensibility and reproach lead me to have more refined and non-inflammatory views regarding the world's future: but so is this but a bread crumb of our core nature and its consequently base supposition, which, practically, simply draws me to then clarify that position and bring it to life.

<div id="groundsforinquiry">
   As we like to say, mechanics reflect the interactions of things, while theism, or what remarks the divine, pays respect to the basis for such movements -in that they were introduced or contrived.
   <br>&emsp;This is what science does though, in that it pays attention to particular things, or at least the function and means by which the waves of reality move. Only, if there is a soul, and the basis for mechanics (beyond its relations amongst particulars) is arbitrary, then so can ontology be our only sight as to how the soul of things operates, or came to be. Common sense regarding this may suppose, that how the soul originates and is proposed, can bear the unviseral nature by which it imparts the roots of mechanics to have the variation as to propell un-uniformity, and by that interactions that cause change. 
   <br>&emsp;The dialectic though is almighty hard to describe, for in that, there are but mere illustrations or figures regarding it and our approach to speaking about it; yet, as a subject, it amounts to all, and thus it is the terms which we'd remark upon it that act as the core defintion -for our understanding- as opposed to representing it before we know and see what 'it' is.
   <br>&emsp;The second I begin to think, the concept, or idea of something comes to mind; yet, of the whole, there is no pure concept, as, of my thought and the subject it contains, so is all part of the whole. Science has this peculiarity then, as it can extract something particular, analyze it and address it; nor is it limited to an instance, but an entire class of things, in terms of kinds; or of the class of all members of entirety; only, once even the basis for things is known and in this sense considered, there is no room for concepts, as there is not something distinct, or seperate, regarding that which equates to all.
   <br>&emsp;This may indeed bridge the gap of that all to erroneous mark of placing entirety within the bounds  of what we mistakenly suppose as another entirety. And, for me, the core trouble of philosophy and physics, is that, of existence, we mean all that moves, interacts, is; yet, of the basis, be it willed in or a remark of a universal fabric which we are wrong to suppose anything beyond, so are we ultiamtely seperating the two; whereby, the error of describing the location of entirety is more like the description of existence within a realm which gave birth to it, but is seperate: and that is not what entirety is. In a skeptical sense, the objects we see are supposedly born of a base which introduced the beginnings of their being: but this divine layer so to speak, is seperate, eternal, beyond the objects which it birthed: the soul. The issue, is that the extent of objects does not go far enough to propose itself, and by that, we suppose an arbitrayer layer, which, less our own objective intuitions, is ultiamtely vast and boundless -as this remarks the nature of what we suppose. 
   <br>&emsp;In truth however, it seems that what has governed and bore the things which we use science and thinking to describe, is not in fact attached to something more primary than it, or at least soul like. Instead, it is more like the soil of the ground, and the seeds of a plant which root themselves in and trunk themselves up: to now, whereby their branches have broadened, the vines have mingled, and the fruits have dropped and the land which all around Man sees. 
   <br>&emsp;The issue, is that without having an arbitrary layer, and less we have a stricter understanding of how things objectively are and came to be, then we are left with a mystery of how all things are part of the same, yet within a bound; or at least, not merely a domain which rests outside the mind and will of some soulish layer. What we are saying, is that the basis for those things, and what their supposed place is merrited on, is in fact part of the string. 
   <br>&emsp;Science it would seem, starts from front to back, and whether it chips away at the top edge, or works its way back, so is it looking into the dark sea beneath it. Skeptically, we know not what is down there for we cannot at this point see it: yet we do believe that there is an ocean floor. 
   <br>&emsp;And I would say, in short, that the two elements of discourse and enquiry is in our actuall thinking, as to remark an absolute truth as is becoming of the whole -as opposed to seperating existence from some seperate entity that contrived it. And secondly, that in our descriptions, we ought to advance enough to be equiped for the appropraite details in coloring the absolute. "For, the primitive and in some cases vulage shortcomings of us in our attempt, leads us to see things as seperate." Which in terms of the heart of our regard, really falls short as we bank too much on what we see to be real, but then close on the fact that of such things and how they appear, that only a contrivance could concieve and produce this: and this, at its core, is disjointed thinking, for why, in your subjection of the things which you deem fit for conception (or willed- birth), do you define them as so, but without the whole origins as part of that? It is that classic example of identity, whereby you say, a star could never come to be, for it is something and of things they can not come from nothing...less they were given. And one then says, 'the sun you say', 'what exactly do you mean? For I see atributes and qualities sure; but such impression is a remark of science rather than thought? And are you really saying that the divine is neccessary on the basis of what science deems? For, the actual true concept and idea of the sun, pushed all the way till it is in fact truly proposed, is one where the birth of it is included, or at least, as a mark of the subject, supposed. It seems wrong to suppose something beyond the subject, on the basis of forgoing what we would in fact already have to suppose to identify the subject in and of itself. We have not done that, which bears some reproach from your divine suppostion; nor, in our actually scientific or inquisitive remark, have we defined what the object (of the sun) is?' The biggest quandery of thinking then comes to fruition, in whether or not all things are the same? And if they are, then how can we properly suppose what they are as strands of the same cloth, if the actual nature and or beginnigs of the cloth are unknown? For we seem then, to have flaps and folds, which are the only remark of such whole: yet, as particulars, they are not themselves truly knonw, withouth their basis within such whole. "And all, more our ease of sake, comes to conclusion that things must be seperate." But that is just the dialectic. And Man is surely past the confines of that. "For he mistakes the grasp of his mind, in its attempt to see the whole, as the destination, or manifestation which it is made for. Only, I would say, that as the whole remarks what is known, and our struggle in doing so seems to come by our limitations otherwise, that we simply remark the nature of that fact, in that of true knowledge we are unprivy: and in accords we should be, as if that limitation gave and corresponded us to respect such insight." And my belief, is that in such absolute reproach, that my otherwise common senses and basis for description, works itself in definig and illustrating the limit that I see. "And personally, things just make sense."

<div id="appearenceofsense">
   I find little to hold onto from evidence which is, however grim and unfortunate, indirect in its source, and otherwise isolated amongst other adjacent facts, and the world as a whole.
   <br>&emsp;When I look at the statsitics for mortality though, I see the world quite large, or broadened rather: as if the width of entirety has increased. "More facts to consdier, or strands if you will."
   <br>&emsp;Only, in that, I see something seperate from wholistic thinking; as per that, the sole course of that is united, be it of one or many strands. And, as we suspend our view of how many strands there are, and further the amount, so must we come to terms with those facts, whereby we can attest to the whole with those as part of them. 
   <br>&emsp;This is why inquiry is so hard, for we would more likely prefer a total understanding, or view at least to have a correspindingly solid regard. Science then is quite limting, if only our submission to the whole is witheld, or reproached from, for the sake of furthering our view of the whole itself. 
   <br>&emsp;Ultimately, we may find ourself sinking into it as a whole, but so is the reason for learning and growing present. That issue then is the crux of all things, for why, if we truly were bare in our complexity of things, would we not further that as to gain the rewards of being settled into something more complex?
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps it is the nature of our mind, that it wishes to, or at least eventually does, settle into an absolute state: as if, be it an ocean or pond, it drifts and sinks into the sea. "Merrily and truly, down the stream of entirety." 
   <br>&emsp;There is defiently room for critique, in that, as we offer ourself to an expanded view, that we get carried away. Yet, of that scrutiny, ought we be clear on whether were scolding over the reproach from the entirety we currently see, or whether, in that expansion, we get lost, or at least taken, by vicious actions.
   <br>&emsp;I would say, in all, that we are definitely nothing of any phenomena. Our senses, are but intricate reactions to the equally intricate stitchings of matter, of which our own stitchings response. In a word, that we are warm, or at least, if our blood flow is low and accordingly, our tissue is slow and stiff, that the nerves of our body reaact in a way as to begrieve us with the effect of that stiffness. This is a very tricky explanation. For, a rock, if melted, merely goes through the chemcial process' inherent to heat. And our point, is that our hand, for instance, if burnt, merely goes through that, in that it is configured in such a kinetic way. The question, or oddity, is, if we have a nerve attached to that point being re-configured, and by virtue of the nerves purpose in making us move away, that the response it gives is one that causes the recpeient (be it in parts or whole) of that signal (or concern) to move. "Reflexes seem to be a less autonomous, or at least explciit case of non-autonmous kind of this." The oddity, is in the descruption, or identiy for that matter, of the signal given, and how, with the admission that there is a complex which recieves such signal, that within such entaglement (of other nerves and tissue will say, ie. our brain) the experience of pain is dealt. Neuorlogially, it amy be so, that our hand is actually hurt, and our brain becomes privy to that; or, the brain makes us feel pain, because, as conseuqnt of the injury to our hand, it responds by yeilding us pain as to cause the neccessary (and developed) response -as injury, by virtue of surviing tigers and that of basic threats (ie., and injury, or toxic smell).
   <br>&emsp;I think, pehraps, regarding this senseation, that to bring it closer to a point of the experience, which is to say that their is a stimuli and impresson of it, that the object of pain need be understand, as is the case for our construction of an image, and the sense we have of seeing.
   <br>&emsp;For the issue comes to 'I', in that, as an image, be it constant or quick frames, that I am seeing it. And I beleive, that there is not an 'I' who is seeing the image, but rather, the image, as per the qualitires of it being visual and defintie (as in the attributes of color, distance), that this is all there is. It is the recognition of this which we mistake as 'I'; yet, I believe, that of that 'I', it is equally born of the same source of reception: and akin to an anxious thought, that with the view as it is, that our means for thought gets confused (upon asking) of that view: and we, accordingly, deem them seperate.
   <br>&emsp;For we surely believe, or refer at least, to the pain of a flame as a different expereince as that of a smell. Considering these are all molecular, and that pain is merely a treatment by that, as is the recptors of your nose taking in the molecules, that, per your speech and inner speech, that these are but wandering cases of the faculties of those, bearing upon those other faculties. "Meaning, that your smell, by its sense, doesnt pay attention to pain, as if it were an expereince of pain dealt to smell; and, as I suppose, it is the mere descritive nature of your mind, and its function of enveloping things as to bring meaning of things and the envelopment given, that the mystery of the other senses affords us no clear means to envelop; and so we suppose, or at least beleive that the distinction of those and the mind seeking clarity, is an indicator itself as to what each is: in that, of those things trying to be conceived, that their impression onto something seemingly sperate, being the mind, that such mind is in fact special: perhaps, by virtue of it being the unqique facultiy which is trying to discern. Smell merely percieves smell, and sight vision: but I believe that we confuse the mind as something other than its own mere (but equally born) faculty, doing what it does: and that as rotten gas is the object which your sense of smell recieves, so is that sense, and all others things sensed, imparted onto the mind as a receipt." And I deem this, though more interesting in the way that a rock is less so than a tree, to be of the same kind as a rock is to the tree. And thus it, like all others, rests within entirety, and is thus, a receptor of senses and words: but these are mere concepts or pleas to move. But as your smell doesn't bring you outside entiretys common realm (or paces), so is your mind, althoguhr privy to all, privialged in no different way. 
   <br>&emsp;In that, I deem the ways of our mind to be a concern for science. As, the object which conceives of pain and vision, is of an equally real sort; and just as I cannot say how the fluid dynamics of my vein work, so am I unclear how the impact of external objects manifests in a pain or visual response. But, as the effect of those objects is merely a configuration of them and oursleves, so are we, as a body, privy to such impact of its parts; and by virtue of a reflex, which comes through the body, so is the treatment of an injurous kind one, that by virtue of the nerves which surround the tissue, and the way that electcity runs, as if at each point through a wire, so is, the brain which sits on the other end configured in its own way, as to configure itself as a consequent of the reception.
   <br>&emsp;All we are trying to say, is that, the expereince of pain is not something, of the body even, which is felt by something other than the body (or some part of it at least). Rather, the re-configuraton which causes a change, and what we call sensation, is merely an impetus to the re-configuration of other part of us, which we call mind or experience. For instance, if our stomach is sore, our toes don't feel it; at least their not impacted to much. And it seems that the roots of behavior and basic movment (towards food or away from explicit danger) is in need of understanding, as to better flesh out the arrangments that our configuration is dealt with.

   There are small scenarios of conflict in the world. In those, there is trauma, some gratuity and putridity, discomfort, perill, anxiety and the looming sense of threat; nor, in Mans entire has, has he been absent of these properties. In fact, the past has held particularlry more scenarios then there is now a days.
   <br>&emsp;Our present age has more stability than that. And in this, it seems schocking to see anything more. The common threats of the world come at us otherwise, like the suns inevitable heat. Children die from malnourishment, their mothers somtimes in birthing them. Infections are common all around, as are struggles between folks, or at least accidents caused by them.
   <br>&emsp;Whats important to rememeber is that conflict comes when those common troubles are not dealt with, and that by virtue of others who have, or at least the assessment that their strenght will be your weakness, theres a response. This may be cultural, as over time the familiarity of people reflects negatively upon eachother -as if someone else is the cause of their own trouble. Nor is relgion but a sharp contributor towards this. At any rate, whether you solve your problems locally, or bear upon those who have, so is preseration key. Moreover, some of us only participate while others serve on our behald; a fireman is no different, in that he helps me in my own burning home.
   <br>&emsp;In my case, as has our stability granted this to most, that were civilians, toiling to maintain ourselves, or at least thriving as our needs are efficeintly met. I hate acting as though our situation is the norm; nor do I like to minimize the pain and vice present in less privlaged conflicts.
   <br>&emsp;But I am still a man, who's health is never quite within my soverignenty, but rather I to it. Compared to those starving, or exotically ill, I am privilaged; but so is my character challenged as others around me poorly spend their excess; nor, are the common pains of the flu or fatigue absent from our ways. And by that, as I'd say the norms for money and comfort compare, am I still subject to tasks and amends. Someone fighting for their immediate life is not comparable: I merely suggest that we lie in the same domain.
   <br>&emsp;And indeed I am privilaged, for my concerns are both less in terms of mitigating pain and suffering; nor, are we even personally absent from concerns to do with excess. "As if oppertunity or past times were our privilaged regard." Ought I do these well though? For in that, my attention is onto making good use of my privalage, and of a genuine sort -as my free time is not well spent, or rightly used in a privalged sense, for frivolity or indulgence.
   <br>&emsp;I guess my feeling is that, of the severe threats to humanity, it is up to governments and their assemblies to convene; and at least arrange their relations and ways as to remove the ability for enough nukes to be dropped -as would cause nuclear winter. 
   <br>&emsp;My spirit is a remark upon me, and in my solid state, I give, or shine at least upon which others stare. This is the philanthropy and gift by which one's very prescence can facilitate change, or an impact at least. But this heart is carried on two legs; and so does it beat naturally, without ask for anything. But if those legs are stiff, then it has no room, or vitality, in its offer. Thats why they say to the wealthy, 'give some away, for you have the most'. I may earn the favor of others in donating little; nor is this even remarked as unsubstantial. But there is an understanding that it is nearly a sentiment. 
   <br>&emsp;I guess I would say, that if I knew that 20$ would make a huge change, then I would offer. But for now, I am ignorant of that, so I dont. This is an assessment though, in the sense that of my current strides, I see no view whereby we could change the world. And in that, I am ignorant to how well I could be and am, and the impact that could make. This all feels contradcitory, as perhaps I am inherintly being selfish. For I dont believe that my course should be for the sake of others; as although they are lower than me, so do I only have so much to give; as, from their heart and sentiment is little of what they own asked of; and by that, despite having more, so do I only have so much; at least, by virtue of having duties of our own -be it natural or of excess. 
</div>
<div id="drygrievance">
   Perhaps some honesty can keep us from tangenting off to a weary demise. Simply, the comments by others regarding peoples problems makes me upset. Or, I am tasked with confirming otherwise. I dont remove the fact of other's suffering and misfortune, or the calousness and duty in those responsible. But I do reproach from over refining our views, as to make things all hunbled and bunched up. This is the problem you see. For the world is large, and a summary view of it, particularly when that one is negative, is quite ppor. Only, the reason that I see it as so, is because such a reality is one that draws so much empathy and greivance from me. For others can be seemingly treated with pure rancor and putridity, or gratuity no less. And the sentiment that this is pervasive and constant is so petrifying, that I am left  to ignore that and feel the shame of turning my head; or, I produce an alternative, or measure of suggestion and repraoch no less as to mitigate the views all too certain and baseless source. 
   <br>&emsp;In pratice,  it is not the case that there is no trouble, or reason for concern. But when the impression given to me is all to shallow and condensed, I cannot help but either retort, or humbly pass the opionion by. The truth, is that dealing with everyone's problems is a harsh despair. Nor, is the removal of characture and its pervailing gratuity a pleasing act; for you may not know exactly where it starts and ends; nor is the actual fact of the act, in that someone was injured or killed removed. 
   <br>&emsp;Our struggle then, is not that we read or hear of someones experience and deem it false. We see that it is true, fully even; but what it means, and at least the reaction of others in how they judge it as so, barrs me from having a sympathetic response. For, if it were true, that someones troubles or distress was so meaningfull, then so would my condolences reflect. But, the nature of this being an incidence, and the removal of sensation or shallow facts, makes it something which is far away, out of concern, or at least something whose impact is but relevant to the subject at hand. There are so many people in the world, and not one remarks an indication of how they all act. Nor would several; for in virtue of that, so is the case for all deemed relevant.
   <br>&emsp;Our greiving comes from ignoring something deemed important. "As if there were a war, and we sat here, igrnoing that; acting at least as if it werent relevcant to us, by which our concenr was more locally addressed." I wish not to do this. But I also dont wish to see everyone through their death, or peril at that. In some sense, I remove the poor taste of depiction, as the death by weapon is then comparable to the death by labour, or tuberculoous, in that each  were a death: and as I care not for someone who dies of a heart attack in South Sudan, so don't I have conerns for someone killed in the Russia. Not all acts are the same; and, although it is harshly unclear, so is there room for what you'd fairly deem gratuitious. But so in that sense are we called to care, not because the death is more substantial, but because it is signifcant. For theres no one at fault for the mortalities caused by respiratory failure. But of those who kill, frighten and derrange, so are they villains, perps, purely at fault. The nature of the conflict and accuracy of its operations come to head; but so are we still keen, or more prone at least to grieve and sympathize with those subject to such inhumane activity. 
   <br>&emsp;I relate this to our duty, or care even, for voting representaives, in that as citizens it is our only right to do. We may from groups as to offer a voice, but so is our direct impact through suffrage. Yet, the place for a sole person seems small; and equally, the seemingly less direct positiion to mitigate or aid one who is within normal peril. I wonder though, of those perrils which are more aggresive and conceieved, why are we any more positioned to impact that? Our voice perhaps is offered, in that we can give our concerns to those who could make a difference. By that token though, I see little who in fact offer anything of that sort for matters of any other kind, locally even. 
   <br>&emsp;So I am left with the prompt to speak up, or otherwise to suppose that not much is going wrong; or at least rest on the foreign and unfortunate yet fair nature of the conflict and its consequences. I'm not fretting over warlords in Africa, or Cartels in americas, nor the terroists and groups in the mid east: why should I care about those whose conflict is severe with any differnce in Russia? And again, I am not saying that there isnt retched affairs that occur. But so ought we characterize and depict it well; in particular, as a blend of every small thing, and amidst the body of memebers around and their own paces. Nothing is ever reported or given this way; and in some sense it is why we fret even less over the many deaths from giving birth; as we can see the more commo ncourse in which that point was reached, a path which we deem credible. But when we see prisoners or hear accounts, or intuit even gross conceptions or near certain realities, so are the paces upon that given ill-regard.
   <br>&emsp;My country is not under attack. Nor are there many which are doing so with any threat to me. I am not being conscripted, nor am I in a unique position, as amongst each countries military there is a body of citizens, one of which is me. I cannot say with explicity that I fair in doing so; nor am I saying that only particular circumstances deem me as so -in denying to fight that is. 
   <br>&emsp;I just care little about my voice; nor am I looking at the array of spots, and seeing any massive piece of it (or many) that are off. Life, and our countries, are like coral reefs; whereby amongst the many, there are kinds, who act differently and thrive in their own kindred or specific ways. And so is the realm full of its differences, be it in the edges, depths, fauna, and neighbours too. I dont feel bad, beyond my sympathay for any specific fish -be it of instances or patterns among those with shared characteristics- in not commentating or chimming in; for, as I believe, it is the faculties and branches of the world which, amidst our association, bear effect to those subjects. And in that, I find little which I even know about such branches; and nothing outside of brevity and adolescnece which sees me confidence in moving anything beyond an inch. 
   <br>&emsp;Our own efforts seem fair then. Perhaps, like some, we do wish to serve, or discipline ourselves to the roles which help. But I am tired of feeling bad for not; at least in the way that is shoved down our throats. And my resolve otherwise, is to strenghten what we suppose, so that I dont feel so unfarily bad, but also not so beholden to argue and succeede: as a man, along whichever course, fortuned or not, I can be, at peace, relaxing, creative, active, at rest, with ease, for fun while playing, industrious in doing, to all oppertunities and success, and our core stability and inherint task. "In which, our common and local command, is to configure ourselve twoards that: and perhaps then, shine."

<div id="moraloflearning">
   There seems to be no argument which couldn't sign our deed as to be ingratiated with the current and awe of everything.
   <br>&emsp;In that, we are free, as our spirit is in line with the stream; and by that, we tend to row merrily, to which around we spread our shine, or otherwise offer a sincerest and whole ready hand.
   <br>&emsp;Only, we are men, and still becoming one at that. Hereby, our desires, as a remark of distracction or true distress, cause our course towards that purity to be sidetracked. In that, we are never so clear as to proceed whole heartedly, and thereby give. Instead, we are left putting out fires, or tedning to our wounds -be it of implse or fair concern.
   <br>&emsp;Where I struggle is in our remedy to this, in that, of that which we lack, so do we turn inwards; which, in itself, seems to bring us to a comparable state as that one where our heart is generous, only, the paces of that way are not but nearby, or local that is. In that, I give due regard to troubles and toil that are in fact around me: but of the world, or those who are but foreigners abroad, so do my paces never reach their way. 
   <br>&emsp;It is true that if our strides were more common, then so would they bring us with constance and lenght, and thereby reach more than what sat outside our door. 
   <br>&emsp;We've reached the dialectic though, for our concern here is not a true skepticisim of our path, but rather an reflection on how our current state is comapred to one's prior which were seemingly then of solidity. That is the contradiction, that were brining this up in the first place. And, rightly so, for I believe that our fear od comfort and posterity is the owner of our attention; or, similarly, that of our purity, we are more bent on it bringing us to the hopes of the former. Only when we remove such need, and see hope in bringing ourselves out in a ways that promise happiness, so can I relax, sincerely but commonly be (as opposed to staking it on ambition). Only, in this case, we are left with the barenss of direction, and otherwise grime of others pain; moreover, our coommon pace, although of a good kind, holds its view close and from within; and in that, the strides which would otherwise bear us upon those foolish and suffering is beyond our scenery.
   <br>&emsp;That is the dialcetic you see, for you are fine, right? In that you are truly worthwhile and ordained as you were in those moments which have your current difference remarking upon. Only, in reflecting on so, it seems like were back to square one, despite, in all likelihood, having the place and means to reach such preferred state more readily and often. 
   <br>&emsp;Our reflection though is upon that station, in that you would be brimming and in tune, and by that, present to all and without fear or scrutiny. So does that pitcht slow though; and in that, our desire comes to question, for in many ways or mishap of that causes us to act in ways that run contrary to keeping the pitch high -as our efforts loose their lightness, as is common with things in a state of maintence, but rather, due to our lack, we bear down on our efforts as to feel more engaged, but therein run over.

<div id="plateofplates">
   Deswcribing things is hard to do. For one, there is this nominal notion, that, of the parts which things are made up of, that each holds exlusivity in the definition; whereas of the configurations, or bodies which they make, that those hold the terms.
   <br>&emsp;This is a remark of terms though and is not really that important for our purposes.
   <br>&emsp;What we see is that there is a whole, and within that there sits the bodies we commonly recognize, their parts of which each is given regard, or a mere ostnesible assortment of bodies which act as mere subjects, and are otherwise as such subject to the finer entities which make them. This is our identity of existence.
   <br>&emsp;The question, is where does such existence lye? For, as I believe it is common, one may wonder, 'how did man come to be, or rocks, trees?' The notion of a seed may shine light onto the truth, in that a tree isnt simply a case of there being one following there not. But so in that source, the root we'll call it, lies the mystery of introduction, 'for how did the sprouting begin?'
   <br>&emsp;This is where God is assmebled, as we deem the creation of something from nothing as implausible, and thus such origins must be intoroduced, or contrived that is.
   <br>&emsp;And for the most part I think this is fine to suppose, for of a thing, which came from nothing, so would the deliverance of that beginning seem neccessary of a will.
   <br>&emsp;Only, the descriptions of the things introduced is where the quandery comes in, for they, as things who are supposedly introduced arbitrarily, must be shown to be things, as opposed to mere rips in a voided fabric. Better yet, if we think, innately, that there is God, and for instance that because we can address him as such, or think of him in that way, and in accordnace justify his existence by the virtue of our recognition -an Aquinian ontological principle- so would I say, that of God, and our regard for him and the according identity of what were regarding, holds such definition under the scrutiny of description. Which, in other words, means that of God and our conception of him, that the properties which we grant him is paramount in actually identifying him. For all things do indeed have properties; which itself may be a quanderous statement, by virtue of the mystery of universals and predicates; though, I believe that, despite the deep point, that our problem still lies.
   <br>&emsp;As I see it, the issue with neccistating the ecxistence of God on the basis of our ability to concieve him, is one that seeks only to then confirm what we already know. "That is, in some sense, the aim of scholasticsim; not to discover what is true and derive conclusiosn from that; but rather to argue for what we already know, as if to give reasons why our innate beleives are laudible." And the notion that God has certain properties seems equally riddled with equal presumptions; that just as we believe in him innately, so is there a given description of this innate belief that he is all powerfull, seeing and present. Which, on the line of believing in hiim innately, seems fair to associate those qualities with him. "For they in fact represent the properties of the thing we believe in -and in other words describe the subject of our belief."
   <br>&emsp;Where this all comes to head is in the existence which Gods neccessity is supposed upon. "For, in some way more or less, he is given status by the neccessity of his being: for, of existence, so must he have given." 
   <br>&emsp;Sleptically, there is the limitation of what existence even is. For one, there is the descriptive fallacy of baser pieces being perceived as wholes, and beyond the nominal issue of identity, there is simply confusion about the derivation occurs. I think the issue is mute, but even if parts and wholes had their own names, there is no clear insight as to the core of those parts, and thus, percieved or not, the basis for the wholes. "I will grant you a firetruck, and the lego that made it as parts; and there may be a red brick, and a red side of the truck: but what are the legos made of? Atoms surely, but what are those? For, then even, we mistake protons for Quarks, which are really grouped up, orineted indivudally amongst others doing the same, and that is what a proton is. And this may indeed merrit the  distinction of nominality, or it may be irrelvant and the identity in place may be better understood as the real entitties at hand. But so is the depths of that unknown. And, accordingly, as I see it, the neccessity of something on the basis of the neccsisty which it is proposed to offer, seems weak when the reason in which it is necessary (being the things which it grants) is unknown (or limitedly defined)."

   There is no reason to be afraid. The world is fine, in that of those subject to experience, they do so through their own paces. Not war, nor violence, thievery and rape, can pillary our truest soul. "For there is not but the warmest glow and cheer within our humanity, that it is but a misfortune that our objectives can cause such bad: there is nothing wrong though: and by that, no need for right."
   <br>&emsp;As we please, life is ours, and can be so without disgrace. For, the routes and moves of things is out of our control; nor, is our impact, resting on the neccessary perril that will occur otherwise. There are merely paces, and no matter the arrangment, so is nature bound through that. And she toils us, asks us to amend, as to recieve what is good. Who we are though, is young, afraid, and by our oldest sentiment, a war has gone on. But so has this not changed the heart of man; for only commericals and immature professionals speak as if it is otherwise; when in fact, the letters of soldiers, combat surgeons, priests, leaders, people, speaks of a life, that amidst all that holds any pernicous bad, is still one that covers little of our life: at least, seldom amounts we can account for, and of those who in partciular can, so are they amidst their own entirety and its shortness of account. I fear nothing then, for it is not my place to remove strands of bad; that is for the culture and proclivity of man to decide. So is this entire though, massive, broad. Reasonably, we need more to say, for it is surely not the case that common mortalityies or the trauma experienced by folks in war is somehting indifferent. But so is the course of this a natural one, with paces that litter themselves around all but the harshest elements of conflict. I see this as a bold permission to remain ourselves: for, the reality which we are dealth to from being so, and in effect not so outwardly ordained, is not one of gratuitous abandomnet, but the stream of living. And of that, the moments of conflict which hold the only poor suffering, is one that our ignornace cannot treat. But in our understanding, so do we see it as a crumb amidst an ocean of otherwise green and civility. In that there is toil, but not of such rancid ways, or unfair ones at that. 
   <br>&emsp;Because of this, I am ot afraid, for my empathys can rest in what nature means us to be willing; and of that, it is not a slew of horrid wounds or punctures, but rather the passing of days and beat of the sun. Stress and trauma do occur, but they are like the fowls and injuries while playing a sport; expected, but not the definition of the sport. Even in war, if a battle calls men to engage in killing, so are they done so for objectivity sakes; and of those who recieve or giveth, I retain by the merrits of letters and abscence of all things contrary to what is notable of writing, that these are men who engage, and as such come forth, expereince, suffer and remain.
   <br>&emsp;By that, we only have our right freedom, as opposed to privilage. And I do mean to see and further know the true side of perril; and otherwise round out our whole and primary view. But so upon this, are we are own man, and subject to desire and joy: the regards of which mark the assimilation of fear, which holds somehitng less so, in apprehension at you being forthright and extensive in your freedom. "As compared to merely accepting the neutral form of life: but really do that, be it for impact, integrity, or rightous claim: so ought you be fine with only that, and cower not at the thought of your own contentment with it: whereby, the fortune taht bears you pleasure, be it in comfort or steadyiness, so can that be requested, accepted, expected, and arranged: at least, of our suitability in being so, is where we must attend -as to say, ask, teach, offer, seek truth, affirm reason, state contrarety, or what your taking serious."

   Science rests as the descriptive measure of existence. Existence, is a distinguishing factor from what we suppose is eternal. As it were, there is an ocean of limitless depth; and by it, willfully, or of something more ordinary, the inital movement of matter was made. The relationship between those movements is referred to as mechanics; and of all things mechanical, ie. fusion, orbits, gravity, kinetics and sound, science is the means to describe such things. 
   <br>&emsp;As for the whole of it, theism, as comapred to deism, is one of eternal and all encompassing reality; but in that, there is a distinct difference of deism, as it -really as a modern, or alternate kind of theism- defines such eternity as indifferent, while theism holds notions of design. More importantly though, is that even if existence was designed, with a model in the mind of the one, or eternal being who iniated, so is there the issue of constancy; which says that, for one, the currents of existence are not done like a play, whereby the results in place can willy nilly change. This contrasts which aspects of theism, which commonly permitt intervention, or disturbance. "Make this go my way, give my muscles and bones strenght, fix our illness, etc." 
   <br>&emsp;The interesting fact then comes when we consider whether something is scientific or theism -with deism being a alternate view, particularly when it comes to the constancy of things. The mind for instance, is commonly referred to as something beyond existence, as either its own entity, or accompanyment to that which is also circumspect to existence (the eternal). 
   <br>&emsp;We must ask questions though, for in trying to prove everything by saying how anything else is wrong is troublesome. For, if science details all, then what gave birth to that? Is it a natural ontology, or something contrived? And so, if we try and explain whether the mind is of existence, or beyond, it fairs us an arduous task to do so, by negating, or inquiring, into the actual scientific basis, or extent rather, of the mind, when the point in which it would reach as to be either natural or not is itself unknown. In fact, identifying anything is nearly impossible, as the void is almost completely unknown, and thus things are hard to distinguihs -for where is there truly space between- nor is the actual trunk of things entirely known, both in virtue of science, but also in our understanding of the soil. And by my station, furthering science is no way to solidify the truth in which it comes from. All it does in fact, is allow us to ask questions, in that we can be clear on what things we are trying to understand the basis for; and, of the possibilities in origin, so can their own basis have an output to be considered against.

<div id="thepathofhigh">
   The stature of our epic seems clear. The year is currently 2024. Mars has not been reached, nor has rockety been advanced to a reusable point. Moreover, in a fair sense, if Mars was reached, so would it take several years for this and any sizable return to happen. Then, for a significant colony to be established, would take even longer, decades perhaps. Further than that, for it to be some what of a nation, or country, is one which has fair limits in the nature of the endevour -and is thus not some novel land for soverign competion- and thus seems limited to an astounding million folk -who are all likely engineers, officers, techincinas etc. "For who else would tour for 8 months to reach mars." 
   <br>&emsp;Then there is the future of earth, in that it is not incresingly common for the unlikley threat of an asteroid to be insurmountable. Nor, by virtue of the law, will computing and technology be novely violent or terroizing. There may be wars, but I point to the evaporation of antiquated views and motives, and the already current diplomacy of the world -whos realistic and otherwise unemotioal co-operation seems to reflect our solidiarty in fighting the real threat of nature and her elements. By that, it seems that the bones of society will emerge, and that from our sensibility, so will it be goverend with appropriate measures -and all while in the custom of states. The threat of mass nuclear use seems to be small and waining, nor do I have any current regard for a lethally widespread virus. Climate change is current, though beyond our actual resolve to deal with it -be it thorugh industry to mitigate and reverse, or our fortitude as to bear the consequences- so are the effecs here one of scars and trauma, but no apocalypse. "As I suspect, it will only wound our statistics: which, as far as I a concerned, is the case in all scenarios, including war. And if it reaches a nuclear point, or something esle truly disatrous, then so will our regards wean from the path of life, and to that of death."
   <br>&emsp;It seems that from our present view, that considering the relation (and quality) of the state with the exepcted developments of cultute and tech is hard. But following general princniples, or concerning those which have fair anticiaption by virtue of our current path, will relinquish any current fears. For, the Blade Runner effect is harsh, in that, from an emotioanal point of view, so is a year or two away so far, and prone to be hazy and alarming -and further decades at that. 
   <br>&emsp;Where our tale begins though is in year not so far away, but one where, following the advent of more accesible space travel, and the pairing of a more novel objective in it with a humanist collective choosen to particpate, so is a far time ahead -by virtue of space flight- one suitable for recollection. For one, predictions can be effectively made, for if one left right now even, and with a given of cryo sleep, and the certain millenai thats gone, so can discourse be had as to how those behind faired in the centuries ahead. Secondly, as that by the (scripted) virtue of those who left, and the roots of their heart, so can that be comparable to our current classical view. Right now, we read Plutarch and Emerosn, who are millenia, if not at least a century or two old. And by that account, as we find little of worth in our current day, so could we presume the century or two that followed to be nothing short of that -besides those who were in fact as original as those in the past, and thus made our present as origiunal. But so, in those, be it uniquely interesting or merely so in a private sense, so could we say that of that which is presently sincere and pure, so could our 'travelling selves' remark upon that; which is to say, that by their family lineage perhaps, or at least being memebrs of a group who cherrish things from a far past -which film and contemporay mediums include- so can the actual gifts (and or current treasures of real antiquity) be relished upon by those in this millenia ahead. And by that, so can our current remarks reflect those from ahead: as, per their motives, so are our interests the same. [By virtue of this story, I can not predict which games or film will come out in the decades ahead. But, practically, our interests lie in literature and more legacied art (such as music). Lord of the Rings for instance, holds a reptuable sway as being a landmark film of its kind; and from the decades that have in fact followed, those films (and thus none of its caliber) are made. Music is similar, in that the cream of the crop generally comes from films of that early era. "Music is not so important though, and so, as a adjacent quality, so is its true merrit (by us humanists) one of passivity, or engagement at least by those who are already made -as comapred to that which seeks to strenghten us, or relieve us."]
   <br>&emsp;On that note, I live on Alpha 9, and it is indeed the end of the millenia. Planetary imaging does in fact show many suitable planets within such light years; but only some of them are sufficient, or preferbale at that. [By virtue of the allegory, ought it have some colorfull shades. We made up then, that there was advances in imaging that showed (where it would not before) water. And by that, we found a planet with something comparable to an ocean; and although it was not clear, there was some fauna, things akin to birds and bees; but no real predators or threats. At least, we just wanted some green in our tale, and appropriated it to more common truths whereby microbes were present and had grown, and the earliest of plants were present -along with an atmosphere which offered snow on the mountains, and rain.] Indeed, there are several planets like this that can be reached in many centuries of grazing travel; and our groups, 'The Masons' were selected -amongst several others. My father, held many of the teachings and principles of his father, and his before him -each being tought to be themselves [by virtue of that, with each holding the core offer of what the fruits of such development gave, offered as well the sensibility, assessment and skill to reach such state. And based on the maturity and peace within that, so were the roots of the family laid.]
   <br>&emsp;And so we lay there, on the souther edge of the Bayron valley, amidst of brethren and folk. And while there, we go about our lives, appropriate ourselves to goverenance, and also the mark in which they are appointed to bear authority -in other words, what we deserve ourselves. And, importantly, we remark upon and further substantiate ourselves as men. "Almost by the pure station of our common practice of writing letters, do we sustain and thrive. For at least when were wrong or unsure, we can orient ourselves with such marshalled acuity. And arranging ourselves around what is right is one that bears us the fruits of the fairest excess -for we never stop having won, or having lost. For our aim in life is reflective of the means in which we procure it, which, according to our sought measure of joy, and its according domain of practice and experinece, remarks our own formative efforts to afford this: which, in a way, relates to one who's objective is to see the stars, and thus amend, happily, to the committment of calibrating the telescope. Such a process bears us a felcitiy in life, peace towards death, and otherwise amicable appraoch towards our end: and thus a path of little conflict -as none needs but what can be earned, received, given by themselves. As, in the ripe state which our dearest pleasure comes from, so is commradery, kindness, receptivity and strenght naturally common." For such a reason, we were one of the collectives selected.

<div id="dearbrutality">
   All I wish is to better suppose the reality of things; as, beyond my strucutral knowledge, so are the bevy of instances and expereinces particular to them, unknown.
   <br>&emsp;And, for example, my aim is to remove this prevalence of our value or impression of pains and suffering that  bear their source from things akin to fiction or nightmares; while otherwise embracing the sincerity and uniqueness of a man hit by shrapnel, 'or a boy whos eyes have been similarly injured'. I just stiltily hate this blank imagery, of victims and perpetrators, of bad people's and those helpless. Crime riddles its head here, as theres this gratuitous notion of being picked apart; nor is torture and subjection much different. These are not off in terms of their material, as men surely have been ripped to pieces, or brutually brought down. But so is the order of such strides one that our suppostion can only fill. Imagery, harsh sensation, shallow minded presumption and or validity is no strong measure, for me at least.
   <br>&emsp;And from there, I seek at least that most bright and full freedom, whereby we can rest on our own laurels and fortune, as our ignornace is not to what is in fact all around, and sincere. 
   <br>&emsp;These regards though hold their limits. For we are not in fact conducting a survey, or lookig to depict every death. As the surgeon said, 'all the men shuttered at the thought of tomorrow, when their charge would be in the face of grapeshot, cannister and straigh shots'. I can only suppose the harshness of the injuries; but so is my purpose not to then say that war is bad; but rather understand how they got to this place, the actual variety of their expereince, and otherwise sink in this otherwise gratuitous severity, by nourishing our fright with the chartered conduct, fortitude, plainess, and simple humanity of men. This does not bother me then, be it in sacrifice, battery or eviceration. "I only mean to not let these frigid sights paint my view of how common days are experiened, or that of the meanness and ball-headedness of men."
   <br>&emsp;As I'd put it, the military is arranged into divisions, each of which form an army. Of these parts, there are groups, which are themselves formed of sections (and their according members). Detailing the destinies and affairs for each level marks the hardest thing; for on one hand you must contend with those who actually recieve the shells of perill; while otherwise resting on the knowledge of others luck, or at least fairer experience. The purpose then of these regards, is to remove all but the practical interest of men, and to remove their swashbuckling and or mobbish buffoonery. And secondly, to allow one to be hit by hell, and in all suffering about, to bear that epxerience on their own accord, thorugh their strenght, splitting away; all the while though, that someone going through the same thing beside, is but a mile away, 'as if the sight of each were beginning to fade, and thus even one at arms distance could not longer be seen'. By that is a man's indivudla expereince dealt.
   <br>&emsp;Our ignornace fairs me some shortcomings when it comes to how certain traumas are supposed; but so in the affairs of life are all under the same reign; and by those who deal it and those who recieve, beyond the explicit share of life's universal current, so can we say, happily, that it is not imagery, vibrance or tales that fairly describe such event; and by that, 'if even all beyond me were expereincing the grimmace of hell, so couldn't I know, rightly at least'. 
   <br>&emsp;In a word, there is a child at the moment, who is dying, or at least is in turmoil, and likely due to some congenial heart deffect. Their mother is wheeping, as our those giving aid with their own pang of sympathy. "But I declare forwardly, that the equal instance of another, be it near or in a world far and unknown, is not to be compounded together, and in that deal us (as the viewer) dread. For that overhwlming feeling of fear, piercing sympathy and otherwise incoming dread, is the wound of those who see people actually hurt. And it is our view, as ones upright and seeing, that need to marshal themselves freely, as not to let the frontiers of their viciosu sight become characterized and cluttered."
   <br>&emsp;I simply believe that none, in private even, expereince things on some island. And, in the snese of an individual expereincing what they can, so is this not a isolated expereince -and in that one of capture by those dealing- but simply one whereby the actual toil of the expereince rubs against our own instrument. "We all breathe the same air, but struggle to breathe on our own. Its as if were joined together, but theres a problem inside: and even if someone were brutishly dealing it to us, so would our actual sight be governed from the outside and in: as if we knew not how or where, but saw the deep throbbs at the bottom of us, while we stood from the top, looking in."
   <br>&emsp;The worlds just messy, you see. For we live in a time which is not riddled with conflict, but natural severity. But so too in older times, would it still be hard to describe the conflicts happening. For where to they exactly happen, and of what propensity does this occur, in regions lets say. And by that, who is in fact desposed from such conflict? And by virtue of the conflicts purpose, that those more striclry invovled would in fact bear pain, or the threat at least, as a cost to the object which their efforts serve. Civilians are hardly innocent, in their treatment, but so musn't we confuse the strategic burning  of buildings and supplies with the mutilation of civilians; nor, ought the assualt of a women and her rape, be a stain against all men, or soliders at that. "And fairly, by the pace of all interactions, would those who act poorly towards those in charge, receive then a fairly, and however escalating punishment." And overall, if we have some sense of this in Rome, or on the Virginia road in 1863, or on route to Luxemburg from Franfurt in 1916, so ought we not let the senstivitiyes of this, or at least the subjects which were dealing with on a more base and common level, be awkwardly applied and conflated in areas that hold similar material, but lack any grounding familiarity -such as the wars and conflict in China, or the americas. For I find, almost pleasingly, that the letters and first hand accounts of soliders and their days through Germany, through the southern states, or all tracks and between which invovle conflict, to be more digestible than if we otherwise inferred what was likely -on the basis of what conflict is- but to a place which has no grounding substnace or material. "In other words, its much easier to see someone get hit here, or another get hit there, then to pciture, or imagine at least, what it'd be like in some far off place, where my own reading and mind is effectively not." 
   <br>&emsp;This is the greatest way of thinking, for a man whos been terribly injured is both not you, or the author likely, but not the assialant (who by further discretion is the same) or other commrades about; and being there, first hand, if even a reflection by the patient in question, bears palpable and graspable detail and strides; which itself bears a more rounded, respectably seen and otherwise definite and thus limited view of misfortune, but also, as accounts usually depict, and otherwise reflect what your own definite view fairs, of the sturdiness, reason and might by which such difficulty and pain is dealt with. "And by that, things are never so bad, or if they are they are not so common; and so much as they are explicit, and rampant at that, so is it onto men, from other men, who loyal, and of those in a way confused, act in corresponding ways, and to a drowning end. But so are we privialged folk bare in our own understaning and thus view of others subject to its immediacy, of death, and how those who were brave enough to surrender themselves and fight, could lose."
   <br>&emsp;I cannot speak about civil assaults, or the further extension of that into death; nor is the severity of criminality something which I can plainly speak about, be it of the mob or the bandits and lords of Africa. What I can say, is that the material which these folk are privy to does not neccessiate, or by a mature lens, correspond with any explicit and or brazen view that such folk are in fact bufoonishly inhumane, unreaosnable, morons, bullies of the worst sort, and otherwise not people themsevles, acting with an objective and organized (and faithfull) accordingly, and that by punishment, poor treatment, or the callously conceived (in terms of how common) sadism and menace (of given misery), so are they all, be it up or down, as all men are, that as such they are natured, rooted pure, and to our own foreing sympthay subject to their confusion, and fear. "And to all you pundants out there, how dare you, with all ignorance, or supscially lack there of, if you even were mature, but to then have no reproach, or stubborn reason that all are in fact pure, that you think they like it, that they simply dont care, and bear suffering to others for their own manichail impulse. But I say to thee, that you lack insight and solidity to your own life: for if you did, you would know that all others hold the mold for the same: and that it is truly fear and confusion which has them act as they do, be it to the leader of a group, or their (leader) own subjection to Gods and the whole of men. But stop your maligning of people, who appear even slightly murderous and putridly devout; for these images your offering seem more like charcters, antagonists, villains, cartoons. At least offer the gratuities given and the perrils recieved under the explicit case of the sun setting and the moon rising; are not this misfortuiens given during a day, lit or not? And of that, are their not proceedings, or fibres and knottings to these happenings? For you are left otherwise with the juvenile depiction of a medieval heretic being lit on fire; only, you forget that such an end is his sentence, and that by such decree, he did not have to ask for a following breakfast: for of such a sentence, following the conclusion of the crime, so was the finaility of it set (no sooner) than the next day. And even then, if the order was given for that spot as it stands, so were the guards who brought the victim to the stake, not drunken grizzly fools, laughing and mocking as they brought him to his place. Nor did their chesire smill and wickedly hooked nose bow over to the man, and whisper something ratish and brutal."

<div id="withoutcause">
   What are we to do then? There is no war in our country, nor that of the world? Their is crime and tyrranny, but of a increasingly local sort? 
   <br>&emsp;I have a problem with feeling lucky, for their is a fear which is awardly childish, or at least all to gruelling in the compressed sypathies of others who appear less likley -or privilage to run away. But I see the world otherwise. Still, there is not a lack of bad, nor are we fair, in saying what things do happen, how they more than supposedly do. But we are in a tricky scenario then. For I can rest a little easy knowning that all of this is due to fear, and accordingly a lack of proper insight as to what our more sensible state would oblige. But so are we merely strucutred in that way, and hardly immune ourselves -of those civil misfortunes. But I cant quite figure out how to feel alright with things, when there is crime, violence, purjury, rape, disease, trauma and accidents; variably placed, and decreasingly so in those kinds which are more vicous. But so are those things a world away; nor am I afraid to rest on our own laurels of insight, and how such vicous ends are not overwhelmingly distinct in those foreing lands. It is econmonc issues and AIDs which saturate Africa, not the lawless bends of crime. And although war holds expereinces which are brutal, so is it not but an affair of the lands which host the fighting. The Americas werent privy to the world wars, nor were the homelands of South and East Asia, or Austrlia. And at that, beyond the direct combat areas in norhter europe, there were surely many folk who did escape; and at least, if they didnt, it was through not being submissive to those were passing through. How is Africas part in all of that not of that way? Particularly those in the south. There are places that are fighting, and historically there have been more. But so are there domestic disputes, local crimes, and besides the unviseral groove of natures condition, so is there common shortcomings, or emotions, that even the most fortiune of us find. Yet what are we to suppose in all of this? Is it some idealist reform, or aid at least -be it specific, as in being a fireman, or on a broader scale, as offering more poltiical service? I dont knonw. I suspect if I did not know otherwise, then my own life would be enough. And at that it surely is, for my self, family, friends, job, and natural end of illness and death, is a task that I must follow. Yet were idle, or at least resting on our privialge, and more daintily following our whims. Admittedly, the freedom of this state is one that addresses the remaining condition, or at least requirments to make the most lively use of our freedom. But so is that our fair, in that we are rihgt and ready to promulgate our views and vision: but so is the worlds, or at least our perceive view of toil, an awkard purpose in which the objects of such ends align. There may not be much what I could do, nor am I being asked to, and condemed at that. In fac, it is more common for me not to make better use of my time for my gain. Morover, my sincere view is one where the demands for full living is further known by many, for that is a remedy I also lack. But the crimes of Africa, the death of children, naturally or by unequal quality, is something which I am unobliged to view: but also not aware of a prompt which were refusing. That may be then, and ultimatley, as I suppose, that on the edge of gratuirity, or that of natural disease, so are those folks braver and stronger than I am, who is merely well off enoguh to be aware of it, but too idle, or aimless at least, not to be bothered -whereby in my reproach from such ends, I see all, as if to make sure that the prevlance of such bad is not.
</div>
<div id="wherewevecome">
   I would describe man like this. He has come, from the annals of behavior, to the collectives at every point and the following nationaliszing, and by virtue of this updraft of community, and the adjacency to others doing the same, that conflict with those adjacents continued through all of antiquity and into the transition from old to modern times. Religions role is paramount, as its motive held a core bearing on early modern conflict; and that by the propogration of that, so were the solidifying powers of Europe full of such momentum. By virtue of their more liberal progression, so did their roots as powers amongst other powers remain. And by that, the world wars which we so grievingly look back on, are but the pinnacles of that European conflict. In that, for simplicity, there is the natural treatment of trauma, the unfair yet orderly ends of those outside the military; and otherwise, there is the unnatural but rather gratuitous treatment of folk, be it fighters or standbyers. I will not comment on the preavlence, or severity at least of this ruthless marbling; but so can we compare the  inpact of shrapnel or a bullet, and the gouging of ones eyes, or further discomfort imparted onto those already in anguish. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, I see that our current place is one of nearly full liberality; whereby the balance of power is not a common or enacted stance, but one of diplomacy (through over arcing institutions), international trade, and the positied poeace through democracy and its spread thorugh states -as monarchies tned to go to war more, and are at  least seen as more dangerous. By that count, we can see how the times of old were more hostile due to their empirical nature, and that this is really but a more populated form of a chief leader of a tribe. "Tribes fight, as their own stature is extremely vertical and bare, and so all those around press upon eachother. And the monarchies of France, Germany and England were so relatively high, that the awarenss of each, for rooted aggression or conceived pre-emptivness in their security, bore the conflict."
   <br>&emsp;By that, we have something different than that of tribes, and thus the times of old. For in that, I'd describe such a scenario as an association of folk, led however, that in regards to their group, 'it is us, our arrangment, our customs and ends, and all others, those outside and beside us, passing by for which we are on guard, or coming in to which we respond, and followingly, with future distrubance in mind, take the fight to them'. This is not the wares of man though, but those misguided by reason. "As if children with the faculties of true men, but letting it poorly or at least innaccutely sway their otherwise primitive impulse." Now, in comparison, it seems that 'us' is surrmoutnable to all; and that by that there is no other. We've no superstitous regard, and thus have a soul commonality, or at least abscence of private (and thus seperate) core aims. And, in plain terms, the bones of our liberal age, having quickly solidifed following the fruits of the prior era, is one that remarks the strides and placement of those keen, and at  least becoming of real men. "Where there is no seperating line between us."

   Suppose I took two numbers, 1 and 1, and added them togehter; then, I added the second term of the latter with this current term, being 1 and 2 -the total now being three. 
   <br>&emsp;Instead of showing the signs of operation (in both the addition and equation), lets us simply assume the operations, and place the terms beside one another -and beyond single digits, we place a coma. From there, you have 11, then 112, followed by 1123 and 11235 -to which you'd sum 3 and 5 to get 8, and have a series (or sequence) of 112358.
   <br>&emsp;Now for some sugar. Take a binary number line, and at each subsequent spot (or term\index) you have a 1 followed by a 0. And so, if I asked what value (or number) was at the 10th spot, you'd say 1, and thus the 11th was 0. These are irrespective values, as per a normal counting line, their count does not match the otherwise normal increase of the index. A trinary line operates the same, as do quarterny and so on. It may indeed be true that typical binary and things of the like do not traditionally operate like this, but for our purposes the explanation (or description rather) fits. For what we are aiming to do, is take these irrespective values, and use them as a scale by which our normal operations are measured against. In that way, the value we have will only be that of the number line were using -at least it will only be within that range.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, you can imagine it like this. If I took the common number of 9, and supposed its place at the same spot of 9, and then added 3, both would increase comparably. But what if the line of operations was limited to 9 itself? Adding 3, we would still be at the 12th point (or spot), but so would the value not be so. You see, as a trinary line goes 1,2,3, so does it then go back, or proceed rather, to 1,2,3 again, whereby the normal spots from 1-9 would be 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3. A clock works similarly, in that of the 24 hours in a day, so are there only 12 values, which repeat themselves as you go from the first to the second half of the day. "And at any rate, even if there were 24 hours on the clock (to match the amount of the day), so would the day repeating lead the subsequrny values to do the same - 22,23,24, 1,2,3.....22,23,24."
   <br>&emsp;Returning to our main purpose, where we take those supposed starting numbers and operate on them, so will you find that doing so on an iterating number line, that of the series as it begins from those supposed numbers, so will the appropriate operations to the itertaive number line lead to those numbers again. "And as presentations go, and of what people say, 'I will simply show, rather than continuing to babble along'."
   <br>&emsp;Take two starting values, be it 1 and 1, and operate on them through a 9 step number line -binary is 2 step, a standard clock is 12. Beginning with 1 and 1, we get 2, then add 1 and 2 to get 3, and those latter two to get 5, and that with 3 to get 8. Here, the big guns lie. For whichever point we are at, so are we displaying, or resulting rather, based on the values. As the line of operation is 9 step, so will 8 added to 5 bring us to 6,7,8 and 9, and as this is the cap (or degree of the line rather), we simply proceed (as if referring to scale -like a ruler), whereby the followng step is to 1, then 2 then 3, and having done 7 already, we add one more to reach 4. By that, our series looks like 112358 -> 1123584. 
   <br>&emsp;There are indeed variations of this, and further ways that greater number lines require us to display, but so will I reach my shining point. Following the current set, 8 plus 4 brings us 3, which then sums to 7, and that to 1; then 8 is reached and a peak value of 9. Since this is the edge, all that is added will simply be itself, since by virtue of repition, the space after the beginning is akin to following 0; and by that, 9 adds to 8 to get 8 itself, and then 8 adds to 9 to get 8 again; these two add to get 7, which adds to 8 to get 7, and that to 6 to get 4, followed by 1,5, 6 then 2, to 8,1,9: and as you can see, 9 added to 1 brings us to 1, which adding to 9 bears us 1 as well, and our series has repeated. 
   <br>&emsp;Bringing it all together in one fair line, is 112358437189887641562819. By our hope at least, victory has come.
   <br>&emsp;Now, this remarks the core tenent of our thought. In any case, if I were to have discovered relativity, and done so through pure observation, I might offer some of those which were initial, and use them to explain the mechaincs by which such phenomena occured -and I would do this to the degrre that I could offer this explanation. But, beyond the actual cogs and principles, lies our further observations, 'whereby the theory of everytthing goes beyond the mere shine of a lightbulb, but that of the stars'. So let us explore the cosmos
   <br>&emsp;For simplciity sake, I well grant myself the means to demosntrate the series that would otherwise seem unfamiliar and unintuitive, but under the working principles already given. By that, we have seen that taking an initia pair of numebrs, operating on them, and of the product, adding it to the latter of the prior two, with a 9 step line in mind, brings us naturally back to those starting numbers. This is a run as we call them, or a series and or sequence. But in trying other runs of a similar sort, we start with 22 or 77, and by that create set, or collection. Then, we may alter the starting pairs into trios, or quads, and following the same rules, merely adjust the range in which we include the prior terms to operate. So starting with 444 (on 9 step), we'd sum this to 8 plus 4, which then becomes 3, and thus our sequence looks like 4443, which then becomes 44432, then 444329 and so forth. This remarks a kind of series, in that all are trios or pairs etc. Further than that, we can then look at the collections, or sets of these runs, and line them up in a cardinal way, or something random. Not, to be clear in that we'd go 11,22,33,44,55 and turn that into 11,33,44,22,55, rather we'd have less orderly and cardinal starting pairs, such as 12,67,83; and in this, we find, that of those runs in any particular kind, so do they return to themselves in an equal amount of steps -this happens through all pairs, trios and quads of cardinal and random sequences.
   <br>&emsp;Following this though we reach the notion of class, whereby we take our number line, or scale rather, and alter that, upon which we then operate. In that, we have been using 9 steps, which is to say that every 9 temrs, places or points, the values reset -akin to a clock and its own 12 repeating steps. As to keep things simple and in line with assumed operations -112358 as comapred to 1,2,3,5,8, nor 1+1=2+1+3+2=5, etc.- we use symbols, letters or characters to represent values over two digits; hereby, the value of ten simply becomes 'A', with eleven being 'B' and so forth. This allows us to mark number lines and according values over nine, but keep everything to single terms. As it were, using a ten step, we would begin with 112358, and going 5 points over, go from 8 to 9, then to 10, and 3 more to 3; and, indeed, if we reached 10 itself, then so would we just put 'A'. This is more more of an explanaion than is required, but describes the class of number lines nonetheless.
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, sets of each kind within each class, produce results that are thematically identical. In a 5 step line for instance, all pairs will repeat at the same point as all other pairs do, as will trios do the same. This is so, to be clear, that within each class, the kinds will repeat at the same spot as other runs of that kind, within that class. For instance, in the 9 step line, pairs repeat every 24 terms, while trios do so every 40. In the 5 step, the pairs repeat every 12 terms, and trios every 20. The comparions is thematic then, and all be it from the same mechanical principle, only so to the ends made by the angle in which those principles are acted on -via the varyiny classes, or number lines.
   <br>&emsp;In addition to that, there are themes shared within sets across all classes. As a preface, when we make a set were basically stacking sequences ontop of one another; and in that, we can look at the columns created at each point (or index). Foremost amongst all my obversvations, is that, assuming the set is cardinal in its order and mirrored in its starting values -- meaning 11 instead of 14, and of that, 11,22,33 instead of 11,33,22- we find that, from the top run down, that at any point, the same value will produce an equal column as other points with the same (top) value. For instance, in 9 step, 11-99, the 7th column begins at 4 (being the 6th term in the 11(top) sequence); from here down, the series is 483726159. Looking at the 17th spot, with 4 at the top, the series running down is the same. What is interesting is two fold. For starters, these values reached are done so, in effect, by calculating each individal run, and merely lining them up; and in doing so, what stacks to be a certain run (vertically) at the 7th spot, does so equally at the 17th. The 9th spot which holds 7, is the same as the 15th spot with 7: same columns running down. And so does this repeat for every column of every value, and with an equal nature in our kinds of sets, and within other classes. Secondly though remarks the whole number analog to this sequences. For instance, if we made a series of 5 plus 5s, we'd normally have 5,10,15,20,25 and so on. Now, in the 9 step cardinal set, the 5 column runs 516273849. This is a summed version of that whole 5 set, in that if you took that set 5,10,15,20... and summed each value, you'd have 5,1,6,2, which is indeed the sequence that our set naturally creates. To be clear, taking a whole number, 25 in this case, and putting it into a value based on a number line, merely shows how many iterations of the number line have passed, and the current spot within the current iteration. Arithematic wise, you simply minus the value so far reached in the current iteration, and that is your value, and however many times the line cap (or ordinacne as we calll it), divides into the remainnig whole number is your number of iterations (or degree). By that, 25, goes to 18, which means that 9, or the cap, has been reached twice, and is 7 steps in. In terms of our series and sets we dont care about the iteration or degree, but value only; and by that, 25 yeilds us the value of 7. This is refferred to as summing, whereby we take a whole number and 'sum' it into a value correspndant with a repeating number line. In the prior case though, we see, that instead of taking the 5 plus set, and summing each term, we merely reach what would be the same sequence in doing so by naturally stacking our 9 step runs. Moreover, if you look at the whole 5 plus set, you can use our iterative scale at that point to, whereby 5 plus 5 is 1, plus 5 is 6, plus 5 is 2, which reahes 7, then 3. And what this shows, is that the sequence of adding 5s can be done in whole terms, then summed as to reach what would be otherwise produced by adding under that iterative scale; and of that iterative result, so does it naturally occur when creating our cardinal set.
   <br>&emsp;<br>&emsp;Simply, Sums is the proccess of adding terms together within the scale of an iterating number line. A clock, for instance, iterates, in that a 7Oclock shift which runs 8 hours long, goes to 3Oclock. This clock is 12 steps, as per that amount of terms or points, the value repeats. And within that, our operations bring patterns. Practically, we work with single character values, whereby all iterations 9 and under will be single digit; while, those over, will simply be represented with a letter; which, in effect, means that 10, for instance -and being represented by 'A', marks the 10th spot on a line; while, 11, would be shown as B, and, following the 10th (as shown by A) is the 11th. In that, we add terms together on a number line of a certain amount of places (or spots), and of the kind which repeats. And, thus, within that, upon summing to numbers which surpass the height of the iteration, so does the product value amount to something smaller. "1oclock plus 9 hours is 10oclocl; add 4 hours to that, and the value is 2."
   <br>&emsp;Now, suppose you took two starting values, of 1 and 1, and for simplciity sake, we display this with an assumption in mind, whereby the characters are placed beside one another, and we presume that there is an addition between them, and from a given number line. Then, adding the two, we show the product of this and put it as the next step in the series. Beginning then with 11, we get 112, then 1123 to 11235 and 112358. Now, using a 9 step line -a clock with 9 hours- when adding 5 and 8 we get 4, and then when summnig 8 and 4 we get 3. Continuing the sequence we go 11235843718988764156281911. And as you can see it naturally repeats. This is the hallmark of sums, in that, taking starting values, showing them with assumed operations (11235 as opposed to 1+1=2+1=3+2=5), and on a repeating number line, so will any arrangment of starting starting numbers repeat, and with the same amount of steps as those which start with the same amount of places. That is, if we begin with 44, and go to 448, so will this repeat to 44 at the same point as 88 will, and 34 and 71 at that. But if we take 111, and add the foremost three values, getting 1113 to 1135, so will 111 repeat, and at the same spot as 222 and 459. And, indeed, 1111 and 4324 are the same. To be clear, it takes a certain amount of steps for 11 to repeat, and that any two digit starting sequence will repeat at the spot; and of three and fours, so will they repeat like all other threes and other fours; but the point in which each kind repeats is unqiue to that kind. "All twos repeat at a given point, as do threes and fours at their own." However, when we look at other number lines, or classes, so do the same rules apply, whereby in 5 step lines so will the doubles repeat at the same spot as eachother, and threes and fours the same; but that these, compared to those doubles, threes and fours in 7 point lines, have different equal repeat points as the doubles, threes and fours of outher classes. The theme, or principle rather, is all that they

   Theres nothing that holds less doubt, than my view that violence is the soul threat. Neccessarily it would seem; as neither I or anyone who complaines, seems concerned about the death of children, the eldery, the impoverished, nor do we question (besides associating it with broader critiques) the cogs and function of our laws and services.
   <br>&emsp;I believe what frightens any of us is putridity, vilness and vice. Severity may invoke similar feelings, but these are such as we deem fair, or natural rather. By that, as childrens death seem normal, so is anything expected like that disregarded. Instead, we look at displays of mistreatment, or the unruly destruction of hordes and fiends. This is fair, yet it rests on no appropriate scale. Which is to say that of what is overhwlemingly true, so does this not merely hold its place, but becomes the color of all.
   <br>&emsp;Personally, I wish to rely on our own view, and one which is in fact all accouting, and sturdy and light in its congruence with others inflammed opinions. As it were, the world is remarked upon through a supposed scale, as only God knows every leaf and injury. By this, there is no general merrits, nor is there a fixated point; for the latter is in fact a mere stretch of the former, while it is not but those which compose it. Simply, the cut and dry approach, whereby we generalize of fixate, holds no definite ground; at  least, so much as we would suitbaly regard, so would there be no inmalleable lines. By this, there is no other, no them, no groups, nor are we different, seperate, but united, like the currents in the ocean, hills and mountains running through the land. Substantiating this is the prescence of these folk, who, like water running down, or bees seeking honey, walk, commit, relate, refute, defend, struggle and at any rate find trouble, but in ways that are not narrative, nor ignored. In a word, coral reefs describe our lives, and the world is full of them. "Only those who put things in a bubble, break our othewise suttle appeal, and provide us with a neccessary brace to our sought understanding." 
   <br>&emsp;All in all, I can see that there are dying children, friends and family who are ill, nor a lack of civil alltercations, or societal conflicts at that. But we must let those relevant to the scenario act themselves. This is a foregin concept, but one that is still local to our regard. This is the symptom of biggots and opinion, as they muddle what you'd otherwise suspect regarding lands far and unknown. We can say, that in our own country, or those lands abroad, that of the conflict, it is done by men to men, and through the vastness of time. In those effects, there is a range of severity, with a layer of vice, vileness and putridity. Our thinking indeed needs fairer terms to distinguish while remaing hole, but so, in our own obligate ways, are we subject to our personal neccessity, the brace of others flurriedness by our own sensibility, and, at any rate, the appropraite remark of the world, in so much as it is poor, and in which varying manners, to the effect that there is not simply great or grizzled bad, nor at home or in some place other. Theres so many locations for things to occur, nor are the worst treatments dealt withouth prior times of struggle, and much neutral time between; nor, is severity the mark of our apprheension; as I cannot prevent the death of a soldier, the attack on a freeman, or rape of a girl; but I can remark upon their likelihood, and remove the horrid-just distinction, and by that, bear witness to degrees of severity, but without any overhwhelming vice, and less so even of vilenss and putridity especillay. 
   <br>&emsp;There is not this whole which needs patching, but rather an eon of roots which hold beliefs of people and their principles in chains; to the effect that communites, states, nations, and the global congress, must work to agree with the good that all humans share, and otherwise remove the strict influence and grief that antiquated ways hold. We can be thankfull, almost globally, that such a situation has occured. By this, I believe our distcontent settles on our own life, and how the curiosity and care we have, is drug down by more idle fears; but so are these, at least when were next to them, reminiscent of certain abscences of knowledge. Which to be fair, are not needed when we are moving and free; but so much as we come to a more slow and vulnerable time, I can at least acocunt for the stability we lack. Namely is the influence of the press, journalists, news and movies, or the media rather. There are all kinds, and none fear the impression dealt to those watching sports. But the discourse and integrity of content which 'information' sources spew, is quite unsettling. And, admittedly, our own status removes much of the sense that their impact is strong; but so are we missing any real sense of its breadth, or distance rather. Knwoing things at any rate can alleviate all concern, for we are present and thus beyond any regard for what others may thinnly say; but at least, certain aspects can reflect the reality of their spread, namely the demographics of those who watch the news, expereince twitter, primarily; and contrasting that with the prevalence of other habits, more or less (as I suspect and have some evidence), shows that the degree of these outlets impact is small. But I must learn this, rather than suppose. As is the case for other types of data, as they too remove worries which our reserved nature toils with. Namely, that by removing this condensed and foreign view, so is there no fear of general suffering -which appeals to whats foreign, and is otherwise entire of that. Moreover, things of an even vile and putrid sort, hold some adjacent insigfhts to actual happenings, but at any rate, as the whole is given less 'foregin' regards, so are the various pieces then subject to what could only be described as 'working', and 'common'. For, as you see how many people live all but over the toil of nature's claims, so is it easy to see how their is no presumed violence or altercations. Its similar to the conduct of war, in how, of those invovled, there is so much time in between; and in that, you see who they are amidst the broader conflict, which gives a finer impressions of their actions while fighting; and having similar contact which those times, makes the world feel together but broad; and I find that our pinning down on possible occurences comes from not being privy to the expereince of so many, who in fact warrant little of that possibility.
   <br>&emsp;I just want to go my way. And in which world it is the one I see, full and with integrity. Rather than declare this, as if to oppose another, I will rely on it, as if we are privy to an enormous bound of truth, by which we are fine to be and treat ourselves small; in that, lies the road between us, and one of ours to treat. Perhaps I wish to remove our justification, as if there is a problem, and turn my head thus from that which comes from a small view, while otherwise settling into our stretch of the real one

   My will is no longer in secret, as if we are kept from the world and our time.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, we once held a sort of freedom, but one of which was unmitigated by any serious matter.
   <br>&emsp;As we grew, so did our oblige grow, but to our hearts dismantle. There simply was nothing more I could concern myself with, then removing the symptoms of poorly dealing with our task.
   <br>&emsp;It seems, in short, that as the age has gone on, we held no stake in anything but our deliberations.
   <br>&emsp;By that, we never could settle onto the pleasure that we had, but were instead ushered into other regards. Doing so then, brought us to seek other comforts and desires, either as a compliment to these committments, or the relief in our frustration of seeking them, but failing to succeed.
   <br>&emsp;Now, I can say that I am a man. For I certainly know not all, but we are so unafraid, that I can say that there is no more pushing force; or in other words, those wishes and dreams that were born of seperate aims, is no longer confused and begreiving. We can simply try, and otherwise be present.
   <br>&emsp;What I can say though, is that the linens of desire are not so removed, and that as I become more secure and able in our true prescence, so do I feel the most obscure threats to that equally obscure desire of mine. No matter what those are, but I can say, for one, that violence, or at least the suffering and injury of animals and foregin folk begreives me; as if our fortuned state seeks to run free, but pangs at the ignorance of others pain. This fear, or pang of sympathy, is there to be clear, in that upon our freedom so are we afraid, in that our furthest desires are then drawn out as to be (as we can) addressed or removed, which is itself intruding. But I have indeed remedied this by reading memoirs from soldiers, be it German, Union, surgeons. And by that, theres a pace to life whereby the gratuity of men is on no horrid display; nor, the recipeinets of chaos done so through constant and unmitigating demise. "Movies and our shifting mind have shown us otherwise." 
   <br>&emsp;There is a more complex doubt though, or scrutiny rather, and that has to do with our duty in society, and the benefit we feel poor to not offer. Posteriy and glory are a core part of this, in that we are afraid, that by virtue of their abscence, so will our life be normal. But so are we equally afraid, or concerned rather, that upon our removal from the public realm, that so will the world go to hell, and all our insight gone to waste. Learning how many people there and their natural condition does remove some of this, as we see how vast and far the issues and or workings of the world are, and by that we are not really asked but little, or expected at least; nor is the basis for our worry so founded, in that the broader the realm seems, the less clear and obivous the problems and solutions are. Moreover, we can see that there are many people already serving the many points of interest. "And so it feels less like were abandoning a sinking ship."
   <br>&emsp;At any rate I see how our prescence is enough, in that by addressing our effort and activity as if the whole world were watching, at least, as if thorugh diolague, we are concerning ourselves by a standard that measures the entire judgement of them, so are we amidst, and together in some way. In a word, procrastination occurs when we are so seeking the end, but doubtfull of our ability to succeed, and so we prepare; yet, if our wants are not so tied to what we'd otherwise do by our common stride, then so can we take risks, or do so at  least with more openesss and regularity. I think, for instance, that relations are built this way, in that if you simply wish to give, and are thus honest as you have no fear to lose, then you inherit in that fact the open and needed elements that attraction and commradery are founded out. "For in your surrender to what you merely need, and not what you unsteadily want, your more willing, and with some evident expectation, to particopate and thus receive: but of the sun on your skin, or taste of something fair and simple, in that your accepting what is there: the account of which is more spread and common in what is normal and around -to which your natural surrender exposes you to."
   <br>&emsp;I am ultimatley confused though, as certain things do excite me, yet, with our built of rules and apprehnsion in mind, so are there things which I'd be pleased to do, but are pinned by doubts and reservation to the means that facilitate the source of their meaning. The key example is publishing, in that I see how we could strictrly write about the novel notion of death; yet, doing so privately, albeit honest and thus present to the world as it is relevant to me, so are we not so open or acquainted with the world as it is in relation to itself. I beleive this is where the worry comes in, as you believe that upon your dissmisal of that, that the world (as its regards are for itself) are passed by, or at least not being contributed to by you. And our wish to have the rewards from benefiting them is what sparks our concern for our place in that realm to begin with; but so in our liberal state, where wants are no longer prominent, I am not sure of my intent in being in that more 'other'd' place; but in that doubt, whereby the lingering of this brings our will into question, so do the bones of those wants feel torn. Their not of concern in any meaty sense, but so is our alteratnive care and effort under its own distress a cause of the alterttive wants to ware and wain. 
   <br>&emsp;For instance, we have struggled for months, nearly a year or so, in distringuihsing between objects as they are fundentally, and how they are ostensibly -to do with configurations of primary, or soul parts. One of the issues, or inquires that this notion is troubled by is space, in that it is hard to remove all things of an ostentious sort into a true form, upon which it is hard to identify space, or an edge even of the absolute. This, as I have learned, is in regards, or relevant we'll say, to a mathematical notion of infintensimals; which, in short, has removed this issues of exact points, and in effect rendered an assortment of metaphysical quanderies mute. This is wonderful, for although I have not assimilated the terms and understanding yet, I effectively have the means to desribe and inquire the whole of everything, in both the domain of all, and its particualr parts. On top of this, it was brought to my attentuion that the idea of self was long ago removed as a neccesity, and that concerning the mind and its supposed viewership, in a contemporay way at least, is admissibale in being souly conerned through a pysholoicagal and physiological lens. And in a word, my wish to understand the brain and its senses is quickly reduced to a need to define the nervous system, vision, speech, hearing, memory, and otherwise the rapidity in which perceived sensation is effectively expereined, 'but is in fact mor akin to the reels of cinema frames'. By that, I believe that the mistaken 'viewrship' of our expereince can be explained, in that, beyond the common senses, that mixed with our faculties, or at least cogs which impress like the rest, that so are they together, in rapidity, expereincing, or at least reacting and bringing us to an astute state, of both the stimule of a direct kind such as heat, and the indirect responses to this, which, for exmaple, comapres to the response to seeing something, in that it conjures a preparation by every input of light, to which the rest of our facultires engage with, as if in attendance and alertness to them. "Whereby the entire nervous system and brain corresponds with all the other parts, bringing our expereince itno one total sensation -and thus the cause of our confusion of a seperate part viewing it all, when that is in fact antoher faculty, or many, corresponding with the impressions which you mistake as otherwise being seperately viewr." 
   <br>&emsp;This is all a long way of saying that of the greatest things wonderment can feel, we are there, and increasingly too. Yet, I mean not to share this, or have it be a mourale which others see; I am in fact, along these lines, more happy with exdpanding our colors and brush abilities, and our subjects at least. If I were to contribute, then  I would write something seperate, as to fit that foot to its shoe. But so is the store far off, expensive, busy, and, admittedly, unclear or familiar by me. It ihas been a long time, an age even, of us reserving ourselves to be as we wish to be persoanlly, but expecting the output of that to procurr what the wants born of our effective lack desired. And this is no more. We have few wants, but true pleasures and comforts we are tuned towards. 
   <br>&emsp;All I have are excuses, as the place of our will to engage with what would otherwise be stated as comfort, is quite far off from ease. The issue is that what is comfortable is more select than it is broad, and that of those things which apply, the time is either not right, or the pursit is one that our current efforts cannot afford. There is indeed a quickening pace in which we are growing, and thus our freedom to pursue other comforts is only becoming more open; and whereas years ahead seemd to be always pleasing, now months seems forever to wait for certain glee. Theres just a great deal of momentum in our industry and creative efforts,  nor have our study and health lost their favored place.
   <br>&emsp;It seems that the more I write the more it feels like were trying to solve a problem, or get around one at least. But I fret a little, perhaps at the reality of our shortcomings and the impact that has on our ability to act with the goods as we currently see in place. By that, there are clear communication problems, be it of relief or remedy from real scrutiny -which in its own right beckons under fear of dissmisal or friction for common (and fairly sought) comforts. Nevertheless, I see, as our wants waiver as their purpose looses its place, that so too in our truly willfull resolve, that to the reasoning and means to faciliate that, in health especially, that there are doubts as to our freedom to do so, and otherwise the means to demonstrate or explain our act of doing so -which, in not doing so, brings murkiness to our own view of what were doing, and thus our wants begin to bear prevalance, but without anything solid or of purpose in their own right, we indulge, or retreat from that, but then into a corner whereby our will to do things we have no open means to do is further tested.

<div id="properthought">
   Facts regard things, and beliefs remark convicted statements about them, such as, regarding so and so, that they are this way; truth, acts like a scale, assessing whether there are means to verify such statement; in effect, if there is a so and so in fact, and, of fact (to the degree that we can attest to the claim about so and so) that it is so, then of the statement we assent to its truth. Otherwise, if the statement is falsefied on the basis of its fact, then so is it false. Then, regarding knowledge, we have statements that are in fact appropriate to what we seek to know, in that, of the presidents name, it begins with J, but if it was in fact Joe and we believed it john, then we know nothing. Learning then, in that we now know, is about things, and in that what constitutes them; and although we may make statements about said things which are true, so may we learn little, in the sense that, of Donald Trump he is a man, but the truth in  this is quite small in terms of what learning this affords.
   <br>&emsp;Inquiry it seems, is about what we dont know, or at least, regarding scales which we seemingly need, so are concerns subject to this but without the scale at hand, hard to know, as the means to verification are absent: but we may then suppose, on the basis of what we do know; which, as opposed to beliefs, which assent to something being a certain way, so do we inquire, in that we ask about it, so far as we know, and what it may or may not be, or may consider otherwise.
   <br>&emsp;In that, there is little to inquire about the world. Some things may be hard to know, in terms of first hand expereinces which our broader knowledge does not confess; but so can we fill in those holes with direct evidence of the sort, or at least that which establihes a reference of the kind. At any rate, what concerns roots itself in our purpose, and whether or not we should act a certain way. Someones belief may be whole, but small in comparison to the world; while we, know a little of that real world, so are our beliefs in accordance with that; to the effect that we remain in suspence, and proceed to learn. So much as we do, whereby our fidelity to the domain of knowledge (or relevant thought) is accepted, so are we in a state of listening, rather than amends; for we hold no beliefs to carry us, but rather the stance that theres more to know, by which we hold no conclusion to respond to. At any rate, we may have susipicions, and at the very least deny perceived or impressed beliefs that others have, as if only to propose that the amount of information holding those is small (and in some ways fragile). And along this progressive way, our view ahead becomes clearer, but merely on which further shines; and our step remarks the extent of which we still don't know: and beliefs seem to lie in an edge which is reached.
   <br>&emsp;Learning about other's educations seems profitable, as the spread of people's values and character will be more distinct and vast; the news can have its day then, for of those who don't watch, or appear credible enough to not be drawn towards conviction, so is any concern about the amount of those otherwise removed.
   <br>&emsp;It always comes down though as to what we ought to do? For, if children are dying at a significant rate, ought we work to prevent this? And even if every 50 thousandth person is killed in the states, isn't there room for concern? 
   <br>&emsp;The question then regards whether we are equal to the state, and that, like a brother, of a part is mistreated, then so ought we treat it like its our home. Personally, I stand on the leadership across our governing sectors; and, so far as it seems off or misplaced, so is there little which is not aimed at. By this, the party system seems one of priorities, rather than care at all. Perhaps, the economy is what differs most in peoples value of one side or the other; but addressing crime and civil services seems more unviseral. At least, I am hesitant to accept any statement regarding what should be done, or what we shuold be discontent with, when the vector for such actions are unknown; or, at least, if someone does know them, but offers no explanation or basis under that causal sense, then I am not so admitting of the effect they claim. Moreover, this seems to lessen their appeal on platforms that serve as educational, when the offers are beyond principles or basic facts, but convicted statements -which seem to make those who don't know otherwise, as equally stated as those they hear, and this makes those delivering less respectable, as they assume their station as both educator and of the right view.
   <br>&emsp;Simply, we are either informed enough to suspect what is in fact true, and otherwise pass on truly small beliefs. And it does not seem to me that every single person is so inundated with media coverage; at least, so much as any are, it is clear that they are not the major amount; and by that, we can suspect that there are likely more people who have at most appropraite views, if any. I personally though struggle with the statement, 'there will not be a global or civil war, and that robotos won't take over, or that our minds wont be subject to or liberated towards computers'. But I can say, that of what seems concerning, it is not so much that I know and consequently suspect, nor is it so hard to forgo diagnose beliefs, but heed otherwise ours or others regards. "For none know all, nor is a reputable measure for truth in these respects even heard by me." What is worrying then, is akin to religion, whereby people act by a truth they externally hear; and passing what those who are spreading this say, is disconcerning, as the effect of others acting falsely is still up in the air. I think of the thirty years war though, and the relative carnage it produced, but of a seperate sort to the everyday path of living; for the concern was not of conquest, but positions for those who could or sought to worship what they wanted. In that, there may be civil war in the states; and regarding territorial wars, beyond some of the local disputes, there seems to be little notice in western world; nor is a stark opinion regarding Russia or China admittable -but worth learning about. The states is so familiar to us, that understanding its state and federal conduct would go great in terms of reducing governmental concerns regarding conflict; civil dispute may occur, but as if between fans, but not backed or headed by any major officials. Amd at that, spreading out our view as to consider the weakeness of the countries tip, can likely allievate any concerns for it piling over.

<div id="groundsfortruth">
   Truth is a remark of judgements, that upon a statement such as 'so and so is this', that, there are relevant facts that support this, making it true. Beliefs seem to be in line with conviction, or assent at least; but the pejorative of beliefs seems to be where the truth is not known, or at least the statement which you believe is a little rare. That is, if you speak about the world in a way, then a great deal of validation is requied, for the subject is so large. If you assent to this appropriately, then sure, make your general claim. But, as a house on fire is less worrying then an entire town on fire, so are general statements likely to rile conviction, as unless the rareness of it can be addressed, then the front facing value of it may be taken as true. "The world has gone to hell," is an almighty statement, as one could not find the time to judge this accurately; but, less you have the reproach to do so, in that you suspend your judgement as to properly make it, or otherwise pass it off for something worthless to know, so may you accept this as true, and act accordingly -which in effect, responds as if everything is bad, which is indeed an alarming view to contain.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, we tend to care for ourselves, and by that, attend to what is indeed prominent and clear. This leads to awkward views though, as they are not so much of one side compared to another, but void of regard, as if there is no problem. For instance, I have to admitted or direct experience when it comes to Ghosts, and thus there is no involvment with that concner. Those who would judge otherwise, for or against, are admitting the question, and assessing at that: while we are unaware. There is a sensibility mind you which gives a bearing for how everything is, and by that, we fear not to be outside concerns which hold no station in this view. We may not know the breadth or core of that view, but of its merrits we are sure (in terms of our actual expereince and admittence), and otherwise, of that and what we attest, so is there little which can be seen. At least, of the superstitions which may be invovked as our error to be ignorant of, I feel fine in addressing the world as it actually seems: and things of spiritual or lawless sort draw no impression, as the strict offer or supposed chance of what may be so from the appearence of nature, holds no such things as plausible, likley or common.
   <br>&emsp;And so I look at our view, and perhpas can reflect on the source of us seeing as so. And then I look at others views, who I may be cynical as regards their source for seeing so, but more to our benefit would we better describe the rubbish which I mean to be cynical about. Simply, our view is entire, and we are admissiable to that so far as we know, and so much as we don't we retain from judgement, and otherwise reach to extend our means of regard; and at that, so much as we do know, it being sizable, and at that with resemblence of the mighty whole, so do we speak and act accordingly, as if the basis for our words drew from that. On the other hand, is someone whose view is quite near to them, and otherwise summaried in regards to whats foreign; some folk have further bounds for what is foregin, as I am sure pundants have more bounds and complexity to their regards than those common; but it is not unlikely that of the pieces which they have more admission of, that these are not summaried themselves, as nations for instance, or a region at that -whereby China is spoken of as an entity, or Africa too. 
   <br>&emsp;Now, the conduct of those who speak this way is not our concern, for they are just words; and in terms of what is most frightfull, it is the objectives of parliments, senates and executives. But, so much as we are ignorant of the latter, so does the former rub against me. And it is indeed those statements which rest ontop of the substance which they generally remark, and, worst of all, the validation of those statements by other general notions. I stand then with two notions, one of which dismisses statements which we could not effectively judge, at least in the time that the scenario of the statmeent suggests -meaning no casual statements about everything. And at least, our own criticism and regard, as to what facts support even the strictest of claims; for in that, if someone says that Donald Trump is a man, and can use facts to prove this, I still don't care. At least, of that truth there is little I know.
   <br>&emsp;In a word, despite our depth, if we are not definite and in a volumous way, then so will our views seem narrow; for as far as things go, the second theres need for complexity, so does that make there appear an other. By that, our efforts should afford a natural view of the world, but one which is also complex. For it is not the case that between two men that they are commonly set to act in certain ways, but that there are many men, and localles at that. "And I believe that the friction of being so complex, is that it seems to spread out your depth, but in that only lengthen the hollow view."

<div id="meandall">
   What we are asked to do is quite local, welcome, and manageble. There are apparent requests though, along the lines of suspecting a danger and your body corresponding prepares; so too in our idle, or at least self driven ways, do we feel like were not contributing to the world, are being shunned for this. In an earlier time, this same source of outward impressions drew envy and doubt, as if others were doing so well, while we were not doing so much (of possibility at least).
   <br>&emsp;And I can't quite say why this occurs; for indeed, the source is from your seperation, and depending on your view of things, or at least how your impressions are angled, so will you see others who are 'thriving', or those who suffer. "And the feeling that were outside of either, brings with it a sense of pity or shame."
   <br>&emsp;My suspcion though relates to this notion of solidairty, whereby even on your own, when dinner and leisure is enjoyed by your self, your still with others. Its this sense of community, or better yet this breadth of your regard. That just as you stair up and see the sun, or the moutains far off, and as regards the lands or the times which your study and attention bring, so is man all around me, in heartfull extent, and those nearby.
   <br>&emsp;This is where the trouble comes. For in our active solitude, we are but amidst the world, but without her comfort. It is as if you were at the beach, and each and all were amidst their groups and friends: while you sat alone. Are you isolated though, removed, seperate? You can see other's actions, offer and receive support in the worst of times, and in the best of ones as you'd imagine, so would others be drawn to your evident shine. 
   <br>&emsp;Its just the case that were not on the blanket with someone, or playing catch. The children run, and people sit in their chairs, drinking, laughing, sharing their picnic. While I, merely watch the birds fly, or see the sun rising and setting, and the moon coming up for an evening drink. I use the sand as a floor for rest, contentment, industry and joy. And although none stop and say high, so am I fine. 
   <br>&emsp;Where the trouble comes is when this scenario looses its vitality, and our sense of those around causes us to crumble. For starters, vitality is a matter of action and rest; and so if  your vitality is to remain, so must you achieve a ebbs and flows requisite. This we'll say, comes from your understanding, as to have a solid view of things as feel fine in your rest, and have the principles to keep your actions appropriate, and more functionally maintained. To me, this is the landscape, our objective. And of those impressions which bring envy and shame, so are these born from the mishaps of that.
   <br>&emsp;Here, we reach a developmental point. Simply, we have come from a time whereby the core of our selves held no regard; for those who did, acted so with a higher principle in mind; and those who now do so otherwise, hold standards for some farther end, and the means to faciliate that. I am merely settled into the qualitiy of my life, and the excess of our time being spent on so -and our understanding which harmonizes this. In practice, our principles are born to serve that, 'as compared to those who restrain as a poiint of honor or sacrifice, or those who are prudent as to garner them success: our aim is set on the flush of our heart, the swoosh of our hand, and all which governs this marks the spot for our tuning and treatment'.
   <br>&emsp;Its quite simple actually. For so much as you are distinct from others, and as much as this draws either disinterest or conflict, so must you finely amend to do what is neccessary, and be pleased otherwise with your fortune otherwise. It was a point early one that our efforts were not commended, and our rewards accordingly. But, whether this is true, or were expecting something in the first place, so is that fine when we are supplied readily enough to do as we please; and earn the reward from that. "As oppposed to charms and comforting novelty." 
   <br>&emsp;WHen I loot at our issues, it is not so much a sense of defeat or injury; for what we need and seek is already mine, and at that most agreeably in the eyes of those who maintain our interest. But in this, we are more practically limited; for our time in the world is one which pulverizes me. This in on the pure basis of our solitude and our struggle to rest. You see, when were doing, the world is there, fine, and we are around and able. But when we rest, the world feels far, and of all its issues, so do we see them undealt with (and to a destined end), or at least handled by others. "And this makes me feel useless, forgetten, and begrunded -as if they see me doing nothing." 
   <br>&emsp;Two things come to mind. One, is that your rest is very much susceptible to the core need of doing it; and if their are family issues, and a lack of confidence, or if your health is such as to drag to such an spot (where the effect is an idling one), then your slower pace wont be one that has any direction or complicity. Secondly, regards systems, and the network nature of all things which our fear of the world reflects. Simply, there is a galaxy, with main branches, arms, bubbles and stars. These are goverened by varying degrees of folk, and officiated by public servants of all sorts. In fact, those are more like the micro officers, who manage our day to day lives. While those who deal with broader and long term concerns, do so as economists, scientists, researchers and such. This is how medicine improves, or our understanding and consequent amends towards climate change. Nor is each degree of the network absent of folk who mean to properly run it. That isnt to say they are right, well informed, or even neccessarily intentioned. But considering the bones of each area and the positions that holds those who govern them, so are there many who circle around these points, or the levels of the complex at that, in order the operate. 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, our rest is one that must agree with our circumstance; for without such harmony, then the inherent issue reeks of neccssity. While we work, so must we respect this; as all other things of an itinerary sort. And in terms of relatives, so ought you ask for little, earn a practical lot, and otherwise ascent to the minor rules and customs of your plan -within such localle, to be. Beyond this, comes are freedom to be as we please, for whichever end, and by no threat of pillarying circumstance. Self regard is our employment accordingly; at least, as much as our maturity has ordained our efforts and consequrnt means accordingiyl. And then, simply, the process of doing so, bears the load of its nature; and so much as your circumstance or fortune provides, so must you retain fidelity -as not to burrow in and implode upon the required rest. And our view of the world, for clarities sake, can mitigate any inconsistencies there. That is, your view of the world should be so fine, that your only worry is one of your own benefit, as opposed to being foolishly worried about conflict, and otherwise more reasonably, but perhaps limitedly concerned, of suffering.
</div>
<div id="unbridled">
   My core, and at heart certain view, is that everything is continuous, comparable, and limited only so much as our descriptive lens can permitt. At that, we are somewhat a physical monist, in that, of the mind -which bars any distinction beyond physicality- is either of the same substance as the rest and therein part of matter; or, if it is indeed something seperate, so is this entity subject to matter. And at that, we are not a pluralist, as if there are many substances. There may be different orients of similar  factors, but not much more than that.
   <br>&emsp;From this, our model of nature is one that is merely variable in the folds and knots of what is otherwise comparable. As it were, there are either several electric fields, or these are but some arrangment of a general field. And by that, due to the evident anisotropies, so do things accumulate, whereby galaxies and their constiuents form. 
   <br>&emsp;Nature is quite seperate from the world, as a family is its own subject beyond the broader place of society. They may mean the same, but for our purposes we can refer to them as something difference. "As if the memebers were of some distinction beyond their associations." From here, we bridge the gap of our mind and salvation, and attribute this to behaviour, unbridled abstraction, and our contrasting reproach onto evident and or speculative matters. "As someone once said, dissolving the problem is not reminiscent of a solution, but a retraction of the issue at hand. In a word, there is a nail, and a hammer would be fitting to hit it down; and either through the confirmation of their being no nail, or a reason to hit it at all, then so are the solutions like a screw with no hole. As it were, as history has gone on, so do such screws repurpose themselves to fit other spots; but as time goes on and their general mold finds even less suitability, so does it wilter away." This is what the notion of God and his conception by men has been brought to, in that, of his portrayal, so are the colors off; nor, of the soucre which enlivened us to identify and attribute him as such, and thereby encourage us to amend, has equally fallen astray. The world we live is one which is free for our grazing time; but only so much as we are like other men, will our ignorance of the end leave us with apprhension of that deeply evdient fact; and at that, expose us to innapropriate alteratives -as if to relief our inactivty to something seemingly pressing.
</div>
<div id="grimandshine">
   So the primary fear is one of conflict. This is brought on by the waivering sight of our administration, and whether by being overtaken, or being absent, that civil strife occurs. This more open and public confrontation though, may be either spuradic and local, such as a random mob, or someone's mere participation in a emerging riot' while on the other hand, there may be an organization of itself, whether that be of a criminal sort, rebellious sort, or of a protestive (or activist) kind. I think of the Congo and its loose governement, and how this leaves room for both civil and organized crime. And theres this fear of anarchy as those latter abscesses grow. "A lack of control or authority leaves us with turmoil and fright."
   <br>&emsp;The miliatary is releveant though. For its members are akin to other servicemen (ie. firemen, doctors, technicians etc.); and of these, be it on a municipal, state or federal level, will be employed to either defend the bone's of the administration; and otherwise mitigiate inner public conflict. 
   <br>&emsp;As it stands, our line between our lives and the world is one which wobbles between negativity and positivity. The former is one of disturbance, by way of injury, or is of a more gradding and or sulking toil. In a word, our body seeks whats neccessary; and in that search, or the maintence of a fruitfull source, can treat us with a burdened mind, and heavy feet. While violence isnt something we so accurately predict; or, at least as we can, be it in our dramas or intuited threat, so is the result one of trauma, and in that a halt of living. As it were, the outcome of the injury may be unfortunatne, but so will this leave you with more friction on your toiling path. But of the expereince of pain and suffering, so are these but drowning shades to one who is otherwise squinting at or showered with light. And at any rate, lingering effects from the injury may bring the line of toil to a grueling point. "But this is merely mixing blood with the mud of your otherwise free liviing." As it stands, the world is awkwardly precautious; and this can only be attributed to our natural model, and its esteemed conclusions. But the weakness of this matches the eradict edicts which it inspires. And by that, much severity, and sometimes cruelty, has occured. And at that, there is vileness and putridity -at least from our foreign glance. 
   <br>&emsp;Of the latter though, lies what is otherwise taken away from pain. For even in arduous (as compared to traumatic) suffering, so are we somewhat pleased to be alive. "For those on tough roads, and inclined ones at that, are more than likely to ask the slope to flatten, or for some fortune to give them a boost; as opposed to wishing they werent here." It is true that suicide occurs, as do we get filled with resent and misery. But this are more due to frustration, 'as if your time was worse than you knew it could be'. And in summary, our remark of what is best described as positivity, is one which balances the overwhelming excess of the harshest pains, marbles the true root of our lives with the undenible misfortune (in how we have to be (in our coping) as compared to our ceasing to be), settles the extent of our toil and its relief through freedom, and colors the liberal garden which grows ontop of this open ceiling, to the effect of excess which is not merely of relief (as to soften our toils) or permission (as not to be in toil), but to color our actual freedoms with the gloss and feeling that our unmitigated efforts dream of. Such a land is one in and of itself. For it is still too death, but in line, just, in harmony. And in that, as our sentence to the stake, or that of a boring time, still sees that of sugar or dirt our preference remains, that our liberal aim is merely one which stears our open time, as to do what it would otherwise, with taste and sincerity on the road to its final gain. "And which Jew, perhaps, on the steps of Auschwitz, failed to see the bright blue sky? Doth our ends change those who reach them? And by that, ought we simply be clear as to what is not becoming, required, or of worth, on such route? For we see it, meet it, in any position or kind? And our poetry is perhaps a realization as to why we curry ourselves otherwise, and mistakenly amend? And that perhaps, in our own relfection, lies the slight change which brought our active time, to be more commensurate with the true ups and downs of our given life: and that in doing so, what was sought was not more, but an agreement with such end: for as the goods of our real-time grew, so did its resmblence to truth in our end grow clear, to which, we felt more encouraged to see it as so, and do what left us with an accord to be in such agreement"
</div>
<div id="merecorrespondence">
   I have an idea, and one of grave importance. Simly, the core of a theory is that it tries to stand our observations up tall; and does so by trying to be deep enough, and in a way that respects the extent of our observations. Philosophy remarks the realm outside this erected grounds; and in these depths one may hold their entire view; or they may otherwise suppose, and in an ontological sense sculpt the needed cogs for the basis of our more apparent impressions. But in this, there lies a very nestled train of thought regarding epistimolgoy. Propigated by Berkely and Hume, and on one end reinforeced by Hegel and Kant, lies a proposed limit of knowledge, by virtue of our mere correspondance with things -and those latter gents and their conseuent schools, solidifed their view on the ultimate basis of such subjectivism. For me though, the problem lies in the nature of our senses. For, in ones assumption that an arbitrainess is essential for motion, and by that, of such instigator and our comparability to it, lies the mind, that so has matter remained so seperate, and subject to a mechanisn which is at its core goverened by the almighty and our perceiving minds. Physics and the rest of science has sought to refine the defintions of these particulars, and by that alter the supposed metaphysical need. But although the pragmatic view of our mind has been established, with much applied growth from this, there still lies this all to considered vitalism of our mind. And in that I mean to refute.
   <br>&emsp;Simply, our mind is a mere aggregate, as is our sense of touch. For the latter is in fact a complex of indiviudal strings, which akin to our body being united, but of pieces, so are the many fibres and strands of our nerves, muscle and bone intertwined as to create the experience of our touch sensation. Yet, there is this all too pervasive distinction of something seperate being privy to such impression. Of this insight, I say, in a common view, that a grip of your mind and matter is absent; and that just as one of a mature kind is not in awe of anything -overhwlemed or put off that is- so is a ready treatment of reflection and active virtue effective as such as not to leave someone in wonder or doubt regarding their mind: and at that, without any apparent interest or evidence to cause such a distinction. More importantly though is in regards to our actual senses. And in explaining those, the otherwise ambiguity of them will not leave so much room to introduce an observer. "As if our sense wasn't already enough." Simply, light is a wave, and a stream within a general field. An atom is similar, in that its parts are but instances of such field, and with binding portions of that field which hold it tgoether -the strong force. What I believe is lost is how our vision is with respect to tissue. For, of this supposed observer, if our eyes were out, then there'd be no visual data for us (ie. the self) to observe. Yet, the actual sensation comes from our brain responding to the inputs of light. As it were, the general field holds arrangments, and light is a mere property of that, whereby its ripples in some way cause its substance and binding, while light is a mere accompanying ripple of those components; and we, as our own bind of ripples, is struck by such waves, and rippled ourselves. This process is the aggregate expereince; and be there a mind or not, that of a ball which falls by God's hand, so is this motion of the general field the ball. And at that, I would describe the issue's of philosophy in that, of two gas bits in a box, that their interaction is a mere natural exchange, except of the constraints and 'supposed' effect of the box. Yet, of our inquiry, as science has increasingly achieved, so is it only fair to presume the bounds of such box as it relates to the existing nature of the gas which it is the basis (or contraint) for. And in my own theory at least, the bits of gas are one, in the way that a ripple of fabric here and there is not a division of such fabric but arrangment of it; and that of the basis for such substance, that it is becoming of one's faith in science or reason, to suppose that such basis is in fact inherint within the fabric. And, at least, that our source of such fabric remain in doubt as long as our identity of that fabric is incomplete; and that we retain respect for the ontological need for such substance, on the grounds that anything contrived is so, that the basis which it faciliates is for that substance. "And one must be quite content, in their certainty, to know only that a floor is required; but thereby speak nothing of its on depths, or any relation to its creation -for you at most know that there was creation, but not how, or of what."

<div id="tippingworld">
   I cannot end war. As it happens, there are folk who inhabit general roles, and based on their volition, animate such roles as to be cohersive, disruptive or confrontational. The nature of our concerns is heavily towards the former, in that of others actions, so may our own abbrahsively reply. For no one wants fighting; but we can also remain mature as we decide what this means. For there is continuity, time, humanity and reason towards the battle zone, the time between, and those who linger around. Theres simply not much I can do. And, as it were, the past incurions have been one where most folk where in not position different than I: that being adjacnet, observed, and at worst mishandled during the strides of those more literally on route to war. These folk are more or less the heroes; though I feel it is of a massive world trying to cooperate, and otherwise surive, whereby fighting between them occurs. Their objective is unclear; nor is any understanding of this built on much more than short statements. It is just quite hard to say. But so much as the defeat of others is each memebrs goal, so is the reason for such hope a long one; and by that, we can attest to the motions which bring together such parties into conflict, and how such forces have drained from our nearly modern world. Within my ignorance, I say that to those involved, that our symptahties go to the continuious stream of combatants; and otherwise sideliners and foreginers who are not at all invovled; and that of our coming time that such a reality will remain; but too, of an end which also perhaps remains more solid and united, by the vectors of that core continuity.

   Reproach remarks a stance of reservation, whereby a bad opionion isnt put in place for none at all. In that, our views are suspended on the back of our understanding that most matters have much more to them then I am privy too -or with a grasp of. I don't then shun the concerns, as the abscence here is only because I know little; but I also dont heed or voice sentiments beyond this: for I know theres so much which I do not know.
   <br>&emsp;The trouble though is that being without a view is quite hard when others are not so reproached. And indeed this is frustrating, for their opinions feel so small yet vehement. And at heart theres nearly no principle fidelity in our broad views, nor any when it comes to judging small matters amidst the whole.
   <br>&emsp;Internationally the law is tough, for what holds the U.N together is beyond me; nor is the more common act of trade blocking and tariffs a less acceptble form of my ignorance. But locally, as regards our domestic matters, I am of the view that those who run the many positions are but animators of the (more or less) constant positions. And simplifying this to who holds the majority sway in parliment feels off; as their are surely other elements of government, be it diplomats, ministers, and the more state wide and or municipal sectors. And at any rate, those who form and maintain the bulk of our policies still have their own internal conduct. And as a form of mature consideration, I'd say that each memebrs differences amidst one another leans on their contrasting views and principles, not character. Anecdotes and instances of true beaurocracy and meddling are not in themselves symptoms of some underlying rot. Perhaps there is a difference in the groove which one sees when it comes to goverment, in that one sees it as a means to serve, or a means to inact change; but for personal gain (and any according negligence or larseny) seems quite less so. At least under a fair, if not reserved lens.
   <br>&emsp;In describing government, we must settle into the relations it has with its subjects; but less the authority is one of a despotic sort, then it feels fair to mark these relations as integrated; as almost definitively, those who are elected are done so by the public, and accordingly they too are the sample which such electees are taken from. 
   <br>&emsp;My perception is simply to do with the disstate of public officials by those who become aware of misconduct, mistakes, ill-wisdom, contrariety and so forth. The issue with this, is that although each dispute is fair, that the details of each one does not (with much strenght at least) cross over to other matters. Trust and general judgement are surely permissable, as the suggestion of one error brings up concerns for an other. But so much as other actions and decisions are concerned, so are the matters of that excluded from the woes of other errors: while these other ones are subject to their own details.
   <br>&emsp;This is all to say that there is this wobbling trust between common folk and the administration. For one, the difference between city, state and federal levels of authority seem misunderstood; nor the general whole and its real ways and principles. And ontop of that, this view that people have is faciliated by a increasing number of sources, to which their view of things near and far is saturated and defined. The quality of such discernment is one thing, but it is clear that most folk have some full view of things; and that much of that contains the misteps of their authoritites. The pure weakness of this is in regards to the function of government, and how much really goes on beyond these peculiar mishaps; and at that, the assessment of the issue is not so easily weighed in terms of how severe it is, and thus of its actual judgement of what it means. So it is odd for me to sit here in reproach, and see people either disgusted or upset with certain figures and their actions, and the system overall. Its quite ignorant, absent of reproach, and almost surely reactive.
   <br>&emsp;Yet, why is this upsetting? Is it because we cannot say otherwise; and its like someone asking trite questions about the universe, and pinning my otherwise grand speculation? Its surely not suitable or fair conduct, despite its absolute point. Yet the proper course, which the question surrounding this would also align, is in regards to our search and discovery -for we are coming from points which are prior to what has yet become known [voiding the merrit of absolute concepts].
   <br>&emsp;In that, you indeed have the overall complex of the state and its content; which is to say its array of members running the various positions, and the general and or specific remarks about the functioning of the land in which their role is part of. And indeed the relations and connection to other such polities is key as well. For, if Canada were all alone and unsubject or with care to other nations like it, then the matter of organization would be simply kept on the basis of what we all hope for; and conversation and rights would be a unifying force and cleansing factor as to retain our shared agreements and administration. Oddly, this seems to be how the world functions right now. And indeed, the modernity of our current time is one which uniquely distinguishes itself from the eons leading into the great wars. And perhaps our understanding is that, in terms of brevity, that such a world and its conflicts were in fact more drawn out and continuous, and in that more humane and digestible; and although the intersections were of a combating sort, so were they met with the more fair and agreeable continuity which led them their, through, and beyond their ends: to which we are the evened out offspring. In that, I see that very little has changed, and that only due to a crushing of lasting principles, was continental conflict erroded; and at that, the shared, or parallel at least, aims and actions between each nation and the goals which they sought for their citizens -which, to a confrontational exhausted point, is not through such conflict. And so perhaps our study need be in the times before, and those of now; whereby our mature lens be spent on the extant of antiquity through the recent world, to the more contemporay stretch of liberty and its struggle to retain it.

   I am afraid to embrace the proper life, as the imperfections of it leave me vulnerable to the extensive reality which our strenght would otherwise wrap around. I say, boldly, that the rigid edge which this fear is apprehensive about, has been more or less dealt with, as not to be so petrifying -in our anticipation at least. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, we are in agreement with life, as to proceed as we truly are, and as we please at that. For upon this road, whereby we are solid and sincere, so are our paces elevated by their inner strenght: to which we dance and shine.
   <br>&emsp;Such an active lane, is one that is guarded and or marshalled by the ministry of men; and I, a soul member, am responsible to oblige this, earn my share, and mend my ignorance and neglect as not succumb to our ultiamte regards; whereby the future we know, and deliberately deem evident, makes our time elsehwere regard those who limit such whims as petulant, small, unstable, and in that recripricative to other's more common, but similarly foolish. This is a horrorified image which comes from our slouching mind. And by that, our agreement, to take nature's hand, dance fully, and by virtue of that, accept, respect and amend, to the existence her floor, and our according end.
   <br>&emsp;Practically, I am no longer afraid to be myself; for in that, the press from within holds no grimace or fear upon settling, and improperly at that. At any rate, our imperfections are but fair occurences, and concerns which are merely subject to my aversion to them, as opposed to what others wish for me to be. Our communication on that front has removed their contempt; nor do I reach for anything, as to hesitate at our own lackings, and the perceived reservation from others. 
   <br>&emsp;I am simply going to be. And my purpose is not either shrowded or exempt from the cultural ministry: by that, we are unafraid to be take a small part, and grow as we continue to felicitously be. And simply, our fear of not being the one in charge otherwise, is held at bay by the agreeable and or grateful sense, of the many who are in charge, their success, the crumbs of their shortcomings; nor, the need to eat other's food, or the awkward belief that other's think its great. At least, how the whole of folk engage is less general than any rightly propose; and in turn of our impression, and especially through the shield of those slouching around, so do they say little, or counteract our broad and vital view. At most, we can see the interaction of their affairs as comparable to scrolling and pornography, in that the effect is not one of altering our disposition, nor the fear of others being so (and their response at that), but our own begruding and exhausting input of such grimey, cavalier and saturated products. Other people are loosing in these ways as they are with poor eating: but this is not a distinct remark between those who are less and those who are more. At least, overall complex and its finer structures hold what is in fact actionable and determining for those opinionitive, idealistic or foolish. "And such shouting and whims make very little change of the bones of such a setup." At best, there is more prominence in terms of who mans such points: but so are such points, when tied all together, a nearly motionless brace which fully provides. "And it seems that the reality of civil unrest, media fighting and regards, and fear of the future at that, has to due with the color of those immortal principles." At least, changing those even an inch would take the force of our sun.

<div id="pitchedremarks">
   Regarding the truth, which we beckon to, but also question, so are we subject to it along the lines of continuous self regard, and that of freedom to be otherwise, but undefined.
   <br>&emsp;On one end, our life is really at most a suspension of impulse, whereby we parlay with more primary forces as opposed to superficial ones; and at that, tango with more delicate and pure forces for a more ripe and fruitfull end. This is to do with dear qualitites, as opposed to short lived expereinces. Besides this, lies the mystery. For I am indeed set and free, and by that, holy stated as to be as we see fit: and at that, act as I am pleased liberally. Only, the remark of this holds a dissolute sway. For the insight of the former point, is that our interests are not in need of clarirty, nor intention; for, as a parched man sees and drinks water so much as he is able, that so is our freedom to do as we please in correspondance with removing the friction to what we'd otherwise do. In other words, we do as we are able, in motion, pleasure, taste; and as our concerns and or duties become either less severe, or maintained, then so does our attention drift elsewhere. Normally, we regard this as positive problem solving, whereby our curisoity holds a need of relief, or closure, as we are drawn to things which remark our less burdened senses. But in either case, none ask and care to define their need for food, but innately heed the growling reponse; and at that, once being fed, so are more delicate faculities free to express their need. But we ask then, upon such liberty, or remission of our attnedance to surivival, as to how we should be? At least, it seems that we see something we like, and of a liberal kind; and my reservation in proclaiming that such an interest will be our aim is in the fact that, of that which limits us from pursuing as we'd see fit (and were pleased and drawn to), that such impingments were in fact still present, and the kind of things needing our regard. This is a nice mechanism, and indeed is one that allows our problems to be solved; and to the effect that our experience is one that is more dear and pleasant upon reflection. "which we might summize as, having put our forcefull efforts into clearing the road, that I am happy to have gone where my perpetual motions take me, as they were otherwise hitting rocks, or a wall." 
   <br>&emsp;A mechanism though is not exactly what I see. And indeed in this state we come to our sprouting interest; and, of such sort, a less than recent development. At that, I see this nature of our desire, and how we are in fact -as comparable to our problem solving efforts- afraid, and reserved at that, or dreaming otherwise. This is where the motion to exclaim your liberal interest comes in. For it is easy to decy the pursuit of something densely pleasurable; while those things of innate good which you pursue hold neither the flavor of that, nor the fortunae inducing end of ambitious efforts. And, perhaps, as we are still with the friction of life, and our personal regard, so is the plea to proclaim a liberal interest on which does so as if to overcome that burdened sense; which, practically, may come as a sort of promise or conviction, when you are in fact not vital enough to naturally partake in such efforts; they draw you, but your hand is ungenerous; and so you instill the future of it, as if to overcome the impression of toil, which colors your stillness. In all of this though, we are merely earning permission; as if, upon a basic shift we earn cash, and a moment of time to relax; that so to, in our truest ways, when the whole of our life spares a moment, we can read, study, sit and see, and by the objects of that, acquaint ourselves with their prescence, and instill them as future goods  neccessairly born of our continuing success. But we are merely sharpening our newly modern tools, as to be more privy, in tune and aware, as to feel permitted to see such things within our liberal state, how to hold them, treat them, earn their favor and hand. But this is a tale as old as time; for our current era is merely a poinnt of the advance, whereby the roots of our fortune are solidified, and the non-brutish elements which we are then aware of are responded to. Its all living though, regardless of our fortunate end to the scale. 
   <br>&emsp;What I cannot explain, as it is not something I create, is the spark of a question, regarding true desire, fear, contenment, and of mine, and its brief way in which the nature of our freedoms afford me. For I was reading a book about materialism; and the prose was so sharp, personal and rich -by lange. In that, this problem I've had for a while regarding the constiuency of things was brought to submission, as this return of the book brought much comfort in how we'd propell our understanding; and at any rate, our cheer and submission to that, merely remarked the good which reading the book brought, and I presumed it would bring. Upon finishing it for a moment, having stepped outside, I considered the strucutre of this desire, and how open we were to heed it and see it moving ahead. And perhaps my point is risen, that of this remark, so is it of a pure good, at least something which was holly original and sought by ourselves. Of this though, lies the purpose of our reflection. As, the nature of these regards was in line with our pure desire, or draw at that. And as it were, a sliver of doubt, concern, or, as it happens, an equally small reassurance, as if to testify the suitability to be so purely drawn, came about; and from that, a sort of momementum, whereby of that reasurrance, we could not say so deeply in a succinct way; and that even if we could be full and convincing, so were there many words invovled with this; and from there, came an even large doubt, at least so much was relatively small when compared to that reassureace, but large compared to the sliver which sided our pure intent. And by that a snowball effect occured, to the point where the initial interest was obscure, and the shuffling of our reassurance came to be. In that, we could see, as if a formula which was brought into existence, and of a large quanity, that there were holes, or at least smaller points and ends which needed definement.
   <br>&emsp;A mechanism indeed. "For I am in fact not free to be, purely; but so, in reaching so, where the impulse is there, and confidently, that the prescence of the smallest doubt reveals which, upon aggregate, is in fact lacking. And maybe, upon tying up those ends which are important, that we can remain confident, and steadfast to our supposed end. Which, mechanically, may simply leave us with things we don't know, but are not in fact usefull: or, of importance, as our actuall reservations source from."

<div id="theworldnear">
   So I am a man without trouble, but a man still indeed. For I have responsibilities to maintain; and, even during my troubles, which lingered infront of our completed duties, so could we see in that finsihed state a time of cheer and plenty. Now, those troubles are removed, and we are left with an increasing stablity and that wholesome sight. At that, the duty we have is not only to what basically provides, but to that generous hand which those colorful lights which ask me to  offer. There is trouble in this though, for the world of this is on its own, hard to communicate, and dragging against our otherwise checked emotions. If we were more strictly occupied, then our stability would be great; but as it were, we are more or less free and content, but fully, and at that subject to further scents. Only, in that broad way, so does the bound of our world view begin to crumble, and all the vague and misty sentiments about it come pilling in. Its akin to space travel, whereby one gets warped, and in that overly twisted until they arrive at their place; akin to Harry Potter and apiration, whereby there dragged hither and thither, till settling in a new and normal point. That is what the far off view of things deals  me. On one hand, art is the response, for in our idleness, or opened way, so do we wish to clarify and describe those swooshing feelings, as to give them more body. But then there is the core trouble of being a man, in that, of our stability and openess, that it is brought by frugality and modernity. And so we are in fact overlly full as it is, however plain. In this though, there is this sense of self, which is all too passionate as to leave its slower state, or is to crumbling, in that of its milder ways, so do its surroundings crucify it. This indeed is perhpas a remark of our solitary ways, for withtou that, we are more focused and in check. Only, the truth rears its head, in that of our regards, concerns and care, so are they on a continous track, and at that one which does not see us in or reaching a halted state. In such a state you'd be more like gas in a sealed bag; which however speckled in its volume, still increases in pressure until the seal gives. At that, I consider our warmth in friendship as a more genuine and promising platform to see and proceed; while in our solitary state, there is less to comprhend. Passion either arrives, as we dream of further things ahead which can draw our attention; or we are dealt with what I can only regard as maturing, in that we lightly hold our slowing pace, and yeild not to the familila and or vague forces which swarm in on me. At that, the latter gets ironed out, as the landscape becomes more flat and defined, and at that, holds its low clarity (and point of projectio) from further away. And, as perhaps remarks our understanding of whats around and who we are as one subject to it, so in that blossoms a source of communication and interest, as we are more free, clear and undischeveld, and at that more attached to things prior to our passionate glance; and here, there is more to say to those nearby, giving us the liberty to proceed (and as such), and otherwise see what is in fact relativley far, but from this finer paces. "Which is to say, that in our unerving state, the groundfloor and position is more extended as compared to our current one which is composed; and at that, the far bounds of our time reach past that stretched state, while our solid and hearty place holds its far regards in an absolutely nearer place. From a 10 mile vantage point one can see 100 miles, whereas, one whos station is on a mile flat, sees vistas 5 miles out. And our goal as a man is in the unerring and winding desires of what makes us in agreement with that."
</div>
<div id="flathome">
   So I maybe see it, maybe. In our slowed ways, theres this need to see something, or define our place and path ahead. Yet, our actual sight is one which is gripped differently, in that it merely describes our real view. Simply, there is this land ahead, and at that lies afoot our starting point. Only, in our resting depths, what acts as common part of the beginning is in fact our actual end. For were all trying to get somewhere, and at that, our posture is reflected. Ours is so dealt with and secure, that what is far ahead is in fact prior to people's starting grounds. Its as if there home is the world, but this sense is quite loose and chaotic; and at that, their far regards are in the solar system but not much further, as if the flakiness of the lens causes their surroundings to be hazy and limited. Ours on the other hand, sees a compact and definite view of my pure self, and at that our municipal area feels like a country. At that, it is much easier to grasp what is otherwise relatively small for people. Commonly, our country is what seems local, and the other side of the world seems far. For me, our domestic zone is a world entirely; and becuase our modern gaze has access to see this more clearly, so does my reaching regard magnify further with solidity. Instead of being on the earth's edge, and loosley, we reach its edge from a definite source, and at that continue the beam of impression out into the galaxy. 
   <br>&emsp;And what I know is that in this definitely vast view, that all in the world is flat. There is no humps and edges, but slow, even paces, and points at that. All that you see, or have heard, is a fantasy, in that it is not exactly so; and, for your benefit, ought be considered flatly itself, or as something irrelevant to the real source. And what I personally see, is that in flat expanse, that our relevant regard is sooner reached than our hearts content could fail to meet. Everyone is so far outside themselves, that their future end lies in the haze of the void around us. While for me, who's concrete moment is closer by and at hand, that of the extent which is deemed common, so is the edge of that (where other's generally begin) lies my furthest regard. And because of this, my dreams and passions, albeit lingering remnants of my solifiying way, have no more hold on me: for their possibility is past evident. "One small solid step can reach across the bounds of time; while a loose and pulled apart pace, can only reach so far -even if its starting point is further out. Its like a dense cloud of hydrogen, which under the pressure shoots out light; compared to a loosely put together clump, who's diamter extends further, but has less strictness to magnify so far."
   <br>&emsp;As it were, this road to the end, at least as much as our end is worth knowing, that I can see how free we are upon its approach. And at that, so can our path in meeting so, be well and kind, bright and fine. Theres no reason or need to look yonder, as the point of its relevance is already seen within the bounds of what we already know. We need to reach for something further, for our experience will not catch up. And so, in terms of our passion, let this truth breed consistency, and at that remove the sores and or complacence which breeds such yearning; and as regards communication and inquiry, simply see the fruits of truth for yourself, and at that be more set and fair in what you feel fine saying; and at that, more able to love, and thus see what you do from this levelled lens; and at that, explore both what is relevant, and acceptable to this real mold. This remarks this unruly fact, that our fleeing views of what is otherwise humane or unfortunately common, is in our unyeilding to the truth; and as if our passion is the vector for what stretches us further away from it (whereby we'd settle), then so do our obscure views get equally stretched: the effect being one natural things seeming malicious, when in fact there tearing makes them appear so maligned. And at that, as this fear builds up, as if a imbedded thorn in our passionalty imbedded mind, so are we left with the debris of poor imagery to burst through, whereupon our acceptence to the real facts must be elevated from their hidden position. The truth though, brings its false horror down: to a point where there is not but the close effect of vice and villainy: but not in the far extents of severity where true misfortune lies. 
</div>
<div id="ebbofourway">
   I'm just a pleasant wreck. Not a single problem in the world. Yet, the effect which rubs against me still remains one, despite our overall mending of it. That is simply the idle sways of receding passions, and the awkward mix of postive contentment, and the remnants of poorly defined views which linger from the wilderlands of our passion.
   <br>&emsp;These insights give credence to holes in our knowledge, or things at least which remark our own personal liberty. For, there are many elements to life which I surely was unprivy too, in our wandering whims, and at that am without despair as we settle in. But of those contents which have been impressed upon me, amd loosely in our impassioned forays, so do our insights reveal where these are ill-defined, and throbbing. it is true that our occupation removes the sight of these, and at that yeilds me room to worry about our own troubles. But as we do, and our  passion looses its way, so do those loose threads buckle in. Again, we fail to notice this when we are settled, or in motion that is. And one may offer the clear insight into our developments, and their abscence of pure occupation; whereby we have less to do in  our rest, less we ware ourselves thin. And at that, we may reck ourselves as to remove our regards at all; as if to dull our mind, as not to be so vital in its resting ways. 
   <br>&emsp;For that is the true and genuine point, that in our normal paces, so does the ebb and flow retain a constance progress. And in this, it is those loose threads which pull at me while our steps are slower, our passions which give our mind some reprieve by seeining a more impenatrable pace, or our disregard, which gives us room to do nothing pleasantly, but with a roughness to our eventual steps.
   <br>&emsp;Grounding this is the ointment to our developmental tears; and alongside that is the resolve which remarks an agreement with the fairest truth. That, is simply that we see our unerring end, and it is in our settled grasp. And in that, we act as would reflect such a scenario. In a word, what is to be gained outside of that bears no concern, and so much as we are asked to or able, so do we along that path proceed. And it is within this that our idle state looses all its clamor. As indeed we are set on a true and forward motion, and indebtedly so, for it bears remarks and prudence to true root and end. Its as if we are not afraid to do as we seek, or am bound to in an according way as remarks our liberated place. Such liberty though is down the path of reason, for our dismissal from peril and fights is not such as to encourage or permitt gluttony and foolishness; for, whichever reason, I know our end is so, and at that have no recourse to ignore it. And as it were, as if a local woft of air which gives an aggregate rise to this mortal fabric, is our common expereince of lethargy and busyness. That latter perhaps remarks the source of our turn from tradition; and at that transition, so are we without much care or strenght to build momentum in the opposite direction; for within that, where pleasure and success hold the vector, so is the busyness of it all a clear vice to it all, and unideal at that.
   <br>&emsp;At that all I have is our ideal; and so little as it is not, we are complete. We are dying, and this fact does not constitue the comparison of others; as this shared notion is one that merely relays an obviousness between eachother, but through seperate entities. This is not too important though. For I know I will die, and at that am moved little beyond what marks our path towards that. I can committ to an understanding of how things are; but truly, there is no clear sanctity of who I am purely, whereupon our wish to be alive curries our savor for wherever there is action. Which is all too say that beyond ourself, as if beyond our internal condition, there sits very little sight or concept of things besides there appropraition to ourselves. Like an oasis, or river, which appears as an object which relates to our thirst, and parched state at that. And as it were, being in such a state promulgates the view of things, as if there all being judged as so, in being fit or not. 
   <br>&emsp;And by that, I must say that of our development, it is but a swirling state, whereupon the openings of our strides we accumulate some external sense, and take that back in to our innermost selves (when our paces relax). From this I have ideas, but one's which are not fully integrated, and at that aligned. These words would feel more assuring if they were in fact probelm solving; but the fact that our problems are but symtpoms of our solidifying state, is such as to curry an interest in removing the problems, or solidify. And I only know that of that latter, that it is done by the steps and cares which remark our collected self, of which we are privy to not but what remarks our end. While those elements which seemed to call me, in both fear and glory, or contrition, feel like goals and threats which have no identity or claim, outside their intermiedary exposure within the lively moments of our day. Yet their fleeing in that sense, for we are never there enough to know them; as upon a routine, we simply hold more breadth and clarity in the subjects we have; yet, many still swirl around, as if unimmedaite elements to our uncovering forray. Perhaps we look to much; as indeed, this ebb and flow of our day, is such as to be not so calm at is root, nor to ample and ill-soft in its peak. For that I say that we are not so privy to things as they seem in our fullest state. But moreover, what there even is to see when we are in such  place; and how we act as such prior, or without, any prior impressions. For what is the world truly, when we are local civilly and true to our death? Is there a world around, a host of folk: how could there be in fact things so general? It is more or less the times. But so are we in a different space when it comes to evening out our days. And who we are in such governance is not so clear. And really, it is the harshnes, imagery and fear, in going about what we find dearly quaint and sincere, while we ignore those elements which our developing state explored, and the prevalence of those claims.
</div>
<div id="keepingon">
   My path is such that in terms of its station, were fine; and otherwise, with respect to me, so are we comparable. 
   <br>&emsp;For the former, we are tasked with itinerary or communication. Practically, that which is given is done so through an understanding; and as it were, our time at home is of the type, and specifically demanding of our communication; for in that, me and my folks are on the same page, and theres no perceived or recieved apprehension. Secondly, regards our committments, which simply have us providing for ourselves in a itinerary fashion. On one hand, we have the common invovlenents of this in part time/local work; and then there are those flexible positions which give leave for transitions. Though, this aspect requires its own itinerary of development. 
   <br>&emsp;As for myself, I am still more or less subject to the world and her ways; and by that, am open and free to be positively, so much as our condition is met. In growing older you learn to accept that there are things which need to be done; as although the efforts to remove your condition are not so favorable compared to those efforts which your stability brings, so is there basic things for that latter to be supported properly. And by that, I have learned that of those simple tidings, be it hygene, homely attire and chores, or the meager attendance of a shift, so are we equally able and privy too similar tasks which could be fruitfull. In this sense, we are not saying to step beyond yourself as to achieve things in an according way; but as you clean your room and show up for work  to provide for your shining life, so can you make equally simple amends in the realm of friendship, relations and oppertunity. On that account, as you would communicate for harmonies sake with your mom and dad, be as clear and open about your interests in gaming, and by this count or another, you may find an according friend. Relations are tough, but so are fine already, and at that prime to give and recieve. And by that, our efforts can be at least fortifying, in that we are openly proceeding with the aim and care to acheive; and that is in the simple realm of online dating, whereby you make an honest and sincere profile, and try at least to be present enough to bolster a claim. More than that, your strict efforts will give you more breathing room, as to relax and settle amidst your otherwise oppertune peers; who in our steadyness of resolve, can be who they are as peers, and not so begrudgenly or nievly judged as relational prospects. Our working in the community is similar. Be it through church, a meetup, or some further event and invovlment, so will that give a breadth which allows you to be yourself personally, and pleasantly amongst folks around. In an equal way as dating, so will your satiety from yourself and its lengthening treatment from more outward discourse, settle your time amidst your neighbours and peers, as to be not oppertune, nor stilitfying at our otherwise stiff and obscure ways. This is indeed a great circle. Accordingly, our professional aims and interests are such, that of this basic and blooming layer, so are there deliberately outer regards which are recipient to our personal touch. This may mean a development towards an occupational skill or trade, or may be more generous, with an aim of ideals or counsel. Aside this, is our writing's regards, whereby our homely and austere craft, steadily opens itself to potential publishers or agents. By that, as we are speaking of ourselves, I wish to conjure, cherrish, and leave (by our legacy/token of promulgation) a ledgerous work of nature's basis, structure and forthcoming development. With perhaps some sugar and cream of our own idealic commisery sprinkled between that latter end.

<div id="rootofourroute">
   Thinking back, our initial adolescence was in regards for nutrition and the crucial nature of it. I did have Justin as a friend, but generally we were on our own. Perhaps his prescnence in this core task excited this, but I recall various insights which we were excited to share. Now I am wondering why? One aspect is the unending and imperfect condition which nutrition was a shield against; which is to say that our accounts (so to speak), upon our nutritional revelation, seemed to be leaking, the plug of which nutrition became. Only -though much time has gone on to make this evident- that such a hole never got filled, and at best, we did our best to mend it; but not to any perfect, or at least constaly as such degree. And foremost, despite our developing proficiencies in such matters, so could our attendance to them never cease. Even if we had the lever which could effortlessly lift the world, so is there no room to release the handle. Historically, our leverage is high, but our employment of the craft is off, in constancy at least. Nor is it immortalized as something of concern; for none of our extenuating matters (regarding family and friends) pay any attention to it; at least no one close cares much at all; and of those who do, they are far, and in many ways trivial and bare in their attempts. 
   <br>&emsp;My point, is that like death, so was the need for nutrition and its regards an evident deed; and that because it was not so clearly solved, or able to be ignored upon properly handling it, so did we seek others interests, as if to fortify our amends and propiety. 
   <br>&emsp;I look back at our younger years and there was indeed this dismissal (and fight) about being occupied, or investing ourselves rather. I was already pleased, and without sincere cares for the issues being smouldered over me. Critically though, we were friends with Colin, Justin, Seb even. And although marijuana and (as it would seem) poor habits and eating were common, so were we generally pleased; and in a word, outside this called for committments, happy. Which is not something I can say now. 
   <br>&emsp;As PLutarch says, growing up is not about abandoning rules, as if into a open land free from your teachers and parents. No, such a land is hallowed by reason, to which our wills ought oblige. This is the difference you see. For in our later youth we were happy; but only so much as our freedom from common investment had something we were pleased to do. As that dried up, by account of our friends taking on their own tasks, so were we left with our selves to play. This was not so enjoyable; and at any rate, bellowed under poor choices and an abscence from the world. I still maintain that if someone had said that me, Colin and Justin could smoke and be friends, that not a internship at NASA could draw me. Alas, we were asked, and a combination of others going their own way, and our remaining time being spent in ways contrary to them, our core selves, and that of our family around, made for a freedom which was not either stable or gratifying. 
   <br>&emsp;I found reason though, with nutrition being the beginning path. In that though, I perhaps experienced what all happen upon, in common or less so ends. Simply, a route of duty is one akin to Atlas', whereby the task at hand is not subject a momentary load, and then followed by an abscence of it, but rather a committment to hold such a weight, and continually. As it happens, one may find different positions, or points of leverage rather, to address that condition. In this respect, my life was such that the basis for the condition was purely fundemental, whereby my own regards and that of matters which were external so much as we extended ourselves (namely studies), which compared to a more common basis, who's concerns were set on amends which would gratify traditional concerns. Which, evidently, seems fair, as such heralded values are such as have come from the aggegrate paces of the past. Yet as a dolphin recieeves the most toxins from a spill, as a little bit in each plankton gets overly consumed as the big fish eat so much of the latter, that of the ill-wisdom and contrariety rung through the past, that so of the might in which tradition stands, such stains are present. 
   <br>&emsp;By that there have been many things which I found unbecoming when not taking them for granted. Namely, the point of a child, and its irrelevance to the population of the world, nor my need to give it anything more than I would need in our development and adulthood. By that, the aim of the former is to faciliatte the latter; and in the pecuniary sense, so is there the limited need to that which nourishes and houses the movments which nature otherwise takes care of. If the child can write, speak, run and read, then he can go anywhere in the world, and prioritize anything he seeks. There's no matter that isn't of such communicatve or generous craft. And the housing required for this is simple. As for me, our route is such that raising the child is a matter of permission; for our required amends to nature, ie. our encumbant maturity upon our actual success, bears both an according regard of how we will properly act in such rearing, and towards which we suitably proceed. This last point addresses one's current address, for they have either received training and are realizing themselves; or they have done so, and are ready to offer something which someone is the luckiest to recieve.
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, our muffledness in reaching this otherwise traditional state is such, that of its contrast to the  latter's complexion, that of the central goal (in kids), that so are we without haste or reason to reach. For the basis for this is that all we are asked to do, is be ourselves, and then upon that, offer what we have, as if to someone who is given the attention of someone already living well -for that is all I would wish for myself, or hope for someone I cared for most, upon the orientation for a goal, to recieve. 
   <br>&emsp;Theres waeriness here, as who one should be when the basis for things is merely that, is such that we are little adolescent in that this freedom from tradition feels like liberty for our more impassioned interests. And otherwise, I am in fact just not there, and at that, am perhaps more  human in my humility, as not to squander over such fact: as if that end of being full for the sake of what my kid will recieve, is itself some neccessary or restraing point which I am ordained and or judged upon to reach. For tradition has no say in the matter. But we are personally then only somewhat modern otherwise.

<div id="headhigh">
   Looking at our position is a dull affair; for in such regards, there would be otherwise excitement, if our address was concerned with our desires and wants, and our needs as much as our pleasure could spare. 
   <br>&emsp;So, by that, we'll make such comments, beginning namely with the common course of our way, and its murkiness during converse with those of a familial or friendly matter. 
   <br>&emsp;For starters, the task laid upon me is not one of potentail, but rather a non obscure commissery. That is, we must keep our head up, remain peacefull and proportianate to the place at hand. Agreements carry not much further than common and or remedial courtesty; but otherwise waver as we obstain ourselves from personal discussion. And of such an offer, there lies the subject matter which I wish to unwind.
   <br>&emsp;As a base, we have according basics. And of these, there are those which, principially, are not quite so, in that of their baseness they are but extended. Of such real basics, lies our common itinerary, namely our post within simple work, the according offer of an equally basic home, and all those orbiting elements of homely and or corporate polity, along with our own remedying and calibratory propiety. Beyond this though, sits what was otherwise blown out, as the depths beneath that common basis were either to heralded, or too uneasy in their attentuated success. By this I mean our cares for nutrition and education. While the outer ring near that common basis is to do with matters that were at one point externally regarded, all while our common basis held to little posture and ease under the shifting depths beneath. And as that ground has settled, and our common basis is not so drug, so do those nearby bounds reflect a complexion of outwardness, in that our regards are merely as such and inacted accordingly, as opposed to being seperate from the bounds at hand. That is, we clean and prepp, speak and consent; and that as these are personal matters which tie the externality to me, since our efforts and regards are engrossing of such matters, that so to as that bound of engrossing reaches further out, that so do such encased matters become equally within our grasp. In the sense that one learns to clean their room, and latter on how to fill out a form for a license, and at that drive a car, that so does one learn how to communciate an interest in working somewhere, and at any rate how to comment on and or reflect upon one's truest cares and interest, and the converse of this amidst people near at hand. As it stands, outside this basis are the matters of relations, profession and contribution. And each perhaps, is somewhat external due to our unfamiliarity; but so too in our grasp on comparable matters, and our sense at that, we identify these foreign matters similarly, and approach them as mysteries that are becomingly less so. By that count, our outwardly nature is merely a mark of extending our capabilities and congeniality to tasks, as to broaden our personal standing. Which, again, is comparable to one who learns to walk, then talk, clean and afford fun; and so to are we bridging the gap between our solidified state and the common pleasures that hold relativley accessible means. That is indeed a development property, and one which can only disclose its steps through relfection. As for now, I can say that our external regards are more related to the views of our passion; as such cares are beyond our current or anticiapted personal matters. Our outward nature though, as said, is merely a steadying segment of our personal stature: as one achieves through learning and expereince. And of that, I can identify specifically, of such a claim, that online dating and similar recreational invovlement, training and or minor itineraries for an advance in flexible provision, and a couresening of our adulthood and final regard through the lanes and time of modernity and the public realm, each hold the bill as those elements whicdh are situating themselves as fruits of our average waking day. "Both in terms of the clarity and its conseuquent excitment, along with the levelness to our ability and regualirity in yeilding the fruits of such elements, and the current pleasne and satiety which such calmness within the braoder world brings."
</div>
<div id="plasticpeace">
   The situtaion then, is that our outward glare is substantiating itself, but on one front which is only fertile so much as we are actually acquriing experience, and the other, which is to do with our clarity on the matter, and the driving benefit of our current ease and succession.
   <br>&emsp;Quite faily, I consent to the latter in a reasonable fashion, and expect little from us as our timely approach in fact bring such elements to life. Surely this cannot be done right now or in a day, but is akin to the whithering of a stream, and its continual degrade of the land its part of; only, our case is the opposite, in that of our erosion of the moments ahead, that it is done so with currents that remark our sight of relations and friendship, profession and oppertunity, contribution and purpose. All the while, our periodical regards are such that principle holds are way; and by that, holds some agreement to that which pleases, or abides itself, to our clarity of such sprouting future. This is an awry notion, as we surely do not have to mould ourselves on the immediate basis of familiarizing ourservles with those outward elements now, but reach them merely, and progress. Neither do we though, have such free and or permitted reign to muzzle ourselves based on our prospects. Surely, as that future is far away, that our aim would be best, in its basis at least, if it disposed us to such a future. 
   <br>&emsp;The future we speak of though is simply a situation, of the kind that remarks someone's educational development, whereby they then new how to perform a skill. And of that, our hope, is to be so familiar and kept in the realm of relations, profession and contribution, that we are invovled with such things, and at least experienced enough to be returing to so. Right now, we are but reaching, and at that, are quite preliminary to a certain claim. In contrast, our means to finding work is such, that both our agreement to it and our austere means to acquriing so, is such as to remedy any concern of it happening, and at that faciliate the promise and according pleasure of it breezily happening. "As one would upon a coming pruchase, whereby their cash holdings would open up all certainty and thus excitment of the coming good."
   <br>&emsp;I guess our problem is in the nature of our current happiness, and how it is not so easily accepted as a place in which we freely realize ourselves. Those coming bounds are really comforting, and steadying at that; but they are not like passions, which rile up from our idle stead. We are pleased right now. And at any rate, our communication could be grounded on the basis of what we care for, and are with respect to. For the latter is indeed our steadying bounds, while the former marks our care for memoirs, LOTR and Diablo. That is simply who I want to be. As it stands, our youtube is not so promising or based in as much as it is an occupation, or source of comfort that is in such a equitable way. Nor, does it truly mark our care and interest, as I feel like we are going over old grounds, and at that for the sake of drawing attention and or showing our shine. I wish to go through more definite positions, and at that herald ourselves as we truly are as a man of positions; and at that be seen, and brought to more primary positions. That is our way: and upon it, I would have a child. For now though, we are indeed home; but so is that a mere side of an otherwise level basis, of which our own simple provisions is lined. I've stated my ideas and sight for growth, and am otherwise here and settled. The needs and comfort here are solid, and at worst fine. And of that, we are so crowded with cares and awe, that I have no burrowing need to press on and situate ourselves outwardly. Such bounds are merely there, while our mind is without haste to incorporate them. At any rate, our shifting grounds by virtue of complancency and or inefficeincy, draw me away from caring for what is outside, as the steady satiety we have from our near basis is accordingly unsettled. Again, developmental regards may assign values to certain things as being more primary, and our oringins and thus paces in meeting so; but in the basis I have, which I can only say covers a home and common workings, is such that it is plain and comfortable to a satisfying tee; and so much as we are ineffiecinet in it, or worn  from making our use of it, so is our path without any haze, but acceptence for the strides ahead. Partially so, as I may merely be choosing our common basis over those apparently outward; but so is the place and time for that situated at different points of that common basis. For now, while were here, and generally so much as our position relativley stays -at least in this foreign land- that we are not so keen on extending that basis. And perhaps that reason is because the current basis is our home via the moment, but not an era of time
   <br>&emsp;It may not be fine for us to be here and act as though we are given a home. Perhaps our occupation is in need of a press, and thats fine. But this current basis does not hold such an extent, that of any outward growth which I could achievee, that too little is here which I care for. I would rather maintain the basis, and flourish through that.  We are not neccessarily leaving, but an understanding is something to attest. For we may squaler our time, sincerely and or perceived. But such an understanding is not but an ask, for our dynamics still require me. I do believe that our time now, is heraled as the basis for basis sake, and holds little which is promsied for beyond our remedying the structure of that basis. But in that, I am without much pain. There is some growth to be had, but again, so much as it is for me to reach, I would rather not, as the change is both a loosening of me as to incorporate that, or a obligation which is not fufilling in our current place. Our commincation can facilitate that. And as much as we care for, a tool for our homely basis can be something akin to journalling, whereby we remark on any communicaitive or remedial needs. Complimenting that are viewer interests, and that of games. But otherwise, our outline of study for instance, is a more cared for embellishment of what I already seek to know. To that path, our current needs, and our otherwise truest bend, we follow.
</div>
<div id="morethanaview">
   There is a boldness which brings apprehension to my heart; but our clarity is such as to paint an easy way. Simply, we are in what is known as a common basis; which one might describe as an ordinary place. Relativley, matters outside one's self are always external, and  passion is but a far glance of such things. While a view of such things as being near, or forthcoming to be in our bounds, remarks outwardness, in that such things are outside, but regarded as near or at least soon to be within it. There is the matter of primary  aspects though; for a kid, for instance, who is on the edge of his youth, may see the licensing and operation of a vehicle; while he otherwise holds the bounds of chores, schooling and familial dealings. As a man, I say that besides my collegues, that friendship is a dear and pleasing element to my life; and as if were, developments have brought me away from such a crucial standing. But as it were, the bounds of profession and posterity are such as to be less primary than our basic homeliness and self regard. These things in an even sense, hold more principle than those further bounds. Now, the point is not that they are external, for that is a mark of your regards, as their being outward is equally a more settled measure of that. Only, the actually wisdom of prioirity, in that, be it anticipated or not, we can at least say that of our basis, it is well in commonly primary sense. Our home is garnered as is our health and industry. And as it were, flourishing from there is all I really seek. Although time has brought me away from those outward things, in that they are not so familiar to me despite their means to be so, that beyond the dvelopmental reason for this being so, that with them or not, I still just wish to flourish. By that, our growth is such that of something peering its head into our sight, so does the simplicity of friendship and relations lie, along with the broader motions of profession and purpose. For clarities sake, those former elements are not so simple for me due to our development, while the latter elements are not things whose abscence rains on what is otherwise deemed normal. As it were, my current path is such that for each kind of element, that they equally feel outward, and near at that. But, our current place is such, that locally we are not so keen to faciliate an outward change; nor is the transition to that more ample spot one which is angled against our content in simply being there (however then promising). And so of our current cares, they are on the potential change and the simpler incorporations of relations that are there. These being so fundemental seem like priorities comapred to profession. Even though I see them each as accessible, so is one more elicitive to our care.  
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, I am only going to be; nor do I swelter at the promise of some alternate place. For in this and that, we are flourishing; and surely our acquaintence with these outer things will bring much leniance and adaptaion from that. I only see, as a mixture coming out of our developing ways, a care and or possibility for relations to be had amidst our own provisioal state. Which normally presses me to such things. And now perhaps, while we are fine to be there and commonly bent for such promise, or here, with a more explicit angle of interest and stability, paired with a bend towards that coming position, so are we fine in this simpler realm. What is thus said, is that of those matters beyond those of friendship, so are they of  less conern for me, in their solidity at least. And by that, our current post is not angled or bent towards that. Our development can speak to prioritiy and disposition, while otherwise we are fine to see, as the future holds any regard, that of a post which is more promising, or elicative rather of growth, that such a post is near, for our choosing, and withotu contraritety to most of the flourishing we now reach: but, of where our mind is at liberally, so is it the mere advancment to what we see and remedial, and at that in our grasp for the claim of comfort. And of that, friendship seems more fundemental and worth our surrounding care, while professions and contribition sit as marshalling channels, for both our coming era and postumous sake
</div>
<div id="palmofgreen">
   When I think of our studies I think of a volume with many different pockets; and when our mind is stiff, or leary, so do those pockets hold more space, and at that room for us to fill in (ie. assumptions and or imagined details). This is not ideal in true sense, nor as comforting, as the presumptions are seldom pleasant. Yet, when we are more circumpsect and personally kept, so do those spaces define themselves more, and at that tear me less as less defined spaces surround. 
   <br>&emsp;My point, is that this is a relfection, or remark rather, as to something I care; and as if a sport or craft, so are we saying that our ability to engage with it, and well enough as to earn our joy of involvment, that such regards are for that purpose placed, as if to see that we are pleased, seeking improvement, or, content with our average expereince; for in that the nature of the activity is given, as, in comparison, a task we had to do, and felt the consequences from not, would see more concerning remarks regarding our inability to do so.
   <br>&emsp;In a word, our indifference is such that of our current scenario we are pleased, as are we to others. Whether we are here or there is one thing; and the elements which set us to either is somewhat dynamic. But whichever I am fine; and so much as we are displeased with our home, or nudged out the door, so am I able to transition, and see the offer from whats new. I think the way I'd describe it, is that a small plate with a heap of the richest food is not something I retreat from. Our life though could afford some width to that platform; and although passion is not much of a reputable force, so is there an edge beyond us which is not but more than what a longer commitment could earn. And, nearer than that, are elements which are more akin to tasks, in that we simply act and engage in common ways. Our development is such that being so open is not always an interest, as the solidity we currently have is precious. But the stake of such solidity is more appropraitley forgiving to the point, where its density need not be so for some infiinte high peak. There is a broader light which we see, and a surrounding complexion which truly resembles the cares I seek. And in this, our base is not precious that it fear exposure or additions. Friendship and relations speak out here; and naturally so, as our past has grown similarly. Work and other things of a civil sort sit outside me in terms of interest, but do hold an inevitbale regard. At least, while before our ultimate regards were based on our brilliance, now they are more with respect to our actual place in the world. And of the cares we once thought would drive our position, so is that position one of a humble and common sort; and our complexion is such as to be glossened by our interests; which have room and care to be so full, for our freedom and ease is strengthed by that forthcoming clarity (of position). Perfection held such far regards, but was based on what our perfection could represent of me personally, and to that what I would be stationed with in being so remarkable. And, indeed, there was both a fear of not reaching so; and even a mild excitment at this eventual thought.
   <br>&emsp;In a word, Ryan is content in a room or home, and as a person they are fine to do so and or consent to an itinerary which affords prospect. And, as the story goes, in being Ryan, there was both a mix of reservation and concession to being alone, as such a place was where being was procurred. Now, such being is present all around, and mere choice and or experience is all that keeps him from the baser comforts. Promise from work is equal in oppertunity as that of fun and friends; only, the latter is like the warmth of a day: a preference. While the former, however possible, is a mere elective, as to align with the itinerate means. As a man, they are but a shining source in their points of support and care. We may shine privatley, and at that expereince the warmth of the world marbled with solidarity. But so in this is there confusion, for the pillars of such being is such as to forsee some coming brilliance. This is an operative element though, for in our being we are without regards; only so when we rest or faulter. But as that draws a gaze as accords our height, so is our wish to have a friend, as perhaps motivated and or glossens that far view, that so can we see with a developed view that our choices can link the nearness of friends and oppertunity: that equally, there lies links to points of actual contribution. And while our previous heights encouraged me to be a certain way as to reach that, so was the expanse between our present and that as such as to pull our disposal to it in such a stretched out way. While our view of being somewhere where the activity is not attratice based on who we are, but is a motion of our giving, that so, as our interests are concerned, do they have a borader and nearer volume to fill, as our regards for such a future elicits. Theres just a more defined and calling route of full being, that the interests which seep life from such concreteness, as if a solid platform to materialize themselves, that so is this view a proper one.

<div id="mistofourway">
   I don't know what commradery is; as it indeed feels nice to help, or see ourselves on some public path. But I cannot say if this is for some obligate reason, a good feeling, or a mix of the two. 
   <br>&emsp;At that, if I were confused about some circumstance, I would wish to remedy it if the result of it was both a pang of sympathy, along with some radiating threat. In this case, the aim would be best placed in remedying the confusion, as opposed to acting on the subject conceived.
   <br>&emsp;In both cases there is an undoubtable contrast between desire and aversion. Yet, such a state (of one way or the other, by our wish at least) is not so reflective of our truest state. For in that, we are neither confused, and at that free from worry, or at least pursuing a hold of it, and grasping it at that; nor is our whim to public one which has any yearning or restless need. Rather, we are in a sense, controlled, steady, and with a sight that is pitched on all things near; and of such troubles which we see ourselves engaged with, their nature is such as to reflect both a broad and elongated path: the calmn consistency of our steps then precede such stretches via a forthcoming regard, but of a appraching sort rather than a reaching one. And, at that, a receding one, which falls flat and or turns inwards. As well, reproach remarks the common settlings of one, who is not so stiff as to fall flat and stale as they loose their pace; nor are they too far forward (in that reaching sense) as to be pulled away from a milder pace. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, our remarks are such of nature and its sprouting encumbency, and that of apprehension, as perhaps pairs with a steadying environment, whereby the regards one has are awkwardly set with respect to such a steadying way, and that trouble which remains. In modern time's especially, that trouble may brew as the rot of freedom -the pits of excess.
   <br>&emsp;From my experience, putting your hand in cold water upon it being burned is comparable to resolving not to drink anymore following the pain of a hangover. This natural settling, 'as if no pain was our equilibrium, and our place was either in peace or remedy', comes about in ways that are not marshalled, any more than one elects to treat an injury. Behaviour is a tricky thing, as, like our senses, no one is alone in its bodily regard; but still, even if our guidance, relfection or deliberation angles our steps to a remedy, so are they not the driving factor. "As behavior is a given concern, as if added ontop of our baser remarks, so is the heart of that base consequential in ways incorprative as behaviorir is to such base." That is, there sits elements of our baser selves which mingle along, outside our attention. Whereas a hangover is a intense event, so are there lingering events with less concentrated effects. For instance, the quality of our breathing, and the effect it has on the balance of oxygen and CO2. "Mouth breather syndrome as they call it." And the point, is that such motions of our basis are such, that the effects of them are mechanical, and at that neccessary, or better yet exhibitive in a way encumbunant to the parts and their conseuqence: and this coontrasts with subjects of our otherwise regard, whereby we may see something going on, and wish for it, or retreat from it, but all from things which we are not so basely responding to, but focusing on. Such attention, in totality, is surely basic and at that mechanical. But for our own sake, the foregin objects which this side of things regards, is such as to be remark the behavioural element to our basis, and its apprehensive side in particular. For you see, meeting a craving, or averting a threat, are quite similar urges; for each, the wish is a relief from some impulse, 'like the one which strikes you when  your hand is too close to the fire'. Cravings are like this, as are passions, in that they are not so much about the object in question, but the remedy of your restlessness. "As if without such a thing, you couldn't sit still. But such an urge is akin to gasping for air, while in the case for a craving, there is a saturation of a chemical within neural lanes; or in the case for passion, there is some seen scenario or thing which compells action, and at that brings you out of the inactive and or contained state which your passion is staked on." 
   <br>&emsp;What I would say simply, is that the mirror of this seeking position, and its purpose as relief, is within interests: or in other words, the former is reaching, based on some remedying need, while the latter is an approach: which itself, holds a front and back complexion, one being of dispostion (as our remedy reflects a flaw), the other of positivity (as your are forwardly, yet from a place of content, drawn). 
   <br>&emsp;In a word, human, is the topical question for all within that kind. And such a subject, to me, is based on that question of disposition. Which, in explicit terms, I identify as a configuration of our bodied elements. And at that, varies itself across injury, the root of passion, the basis for craving, and the more mysterious, albeit modern intrigue towards things around, and its identity of 'a progress towards something for the basis of what can only be described as interest'. All may be mechanical, but so is their a mightily modern property which contrasts with the pre-modern property of negativity (or an impulse to cease and or relieve). Such positivity, as I often say, is merely a configuration like those which procure a negative relief. Better put, the bodily basis which I am remarking, regardless of form, is about relief, in that each part serves as an input to that which surrounds us, and at that outputs what we could only describe (of things living) as a press, step, will to live. The soul discprency within this account, is of the complexion of such relief, and whether it is of, more or less, reproach, approach or reaching. As well, non living sits as a flatter state beneath reproach; as one merely says that we are moving slower, with tenderness, but no so much as to come to a stop. In fact, the near practical struggle in doing this describes the landscape best, in that, of a state of approach, we are moving quicker than a state of reproach, but not as quick as a hasty reach. While a halt, or idleness, is all too motionless, whereas reproach, or an even milder form called stillness, is merely less motion, but enough to remain moving. "While those who cannot be in such a slow state, hurry forward as to be in movement, or stiffen up, and get pushed by the need to move (restlessness) -from behind, by the coming wall of time."
   <br>&emsp;How things are, such is about that wall of time and its procurment of our true basis. But there is also an auxillary point, whereby this fundemental notion derives the moutain of intricacy which the basis affords. "The aggregates of existence so to speak." And here, we can speak to our effective origins as man, civilization, the concentrated history of our path to modernity, and our now current precipace to that very status. Because, at this point, there is what there is, and to an increasingly deep detail. But so are we, as part of this intricacy, reflecting, or responding rather, and at that, privy to the nature which affords our objective basis. "For such a basis, by these accounts, exhibits itself by its very bodily response to those other bodies around. Which one might describe as a portion of the stream being what it is, as a current, encumbuent to parts around." From this comes the all mighty limit to our modern preface: is my remark about our basis within reality, a exhibiter of something beyond that basis? Or, is my thought merely a reaction within the surrounding arrangments which it is of equal kind? And, at that, is the inquiry as to the pieces which such remarks and their subjects are based on, identifiable from such derived entities? 
   <br>&emsp;Indeed I don't know. To quote Mr Hume though, 'however much you attain the place of a philosopher, do remain a man'. From this, I welcome the quaint yet fair notion of that mechanical thought, and how, despite it being somewhat blurry in its potential yeilds, so ought the given nature of it being mechanical, or at least derived from the mystery which we squinting to see, that we would iron the basis for such lens, and at that sow in suitable paramaters as the instrument respects. 
   <br>&emsp;This in one notion mind you. The rest of my thinking, or attention rather, goes in an admittedly similar plane of inquiry, but without such epistomoligcal regard, but rather sets its investigation on describing the images which my otherwise untroubled mind sees. For may I not just be myself, and in that being, notice what I commonly do. Indeed, what I have is not a complete sentiment, but one who's virtue perhaps indiciates a problem otherwise. And that is such, that of our wish to see, or find the explanation for all, and understand such basis, that in these regards I see a deep apprhension, as if a remedy will be served upon uncovering such mystery. The mystery may be the source of the fear, or it may be something else, be it confused or pedantic curisoity and the conseuqent treat born upon such a fine insight. In a word, these efforts seem like that of an uneven man. As one who is at least angled to be otherwise, I can say, with almost no concession, that the wish to understand 'all', is not what our natural remarks care for. Rather, our ancient development and the culturure procurred around it, merely sprouted a consequent behaviur which was inaccurate in its portrait of the world, and at that, mistaken in the objects which it regarded. And it is such an important point, that we mention the current continuity of this, and how the source of the apprehension we have now, is merely born from those flawed conceptions. "And, in practice, their rooting into the cultural fabric, the faciliation by education and parenting, and the higher auxillary point of where our doubts even began to question. 'Does the earth really bind all the planets in its orbit, or is this perhaps not so?' Such is indeed a good question, but is quite inferior to the question which remarks the reason for the planets orbiting as they actually do -doubts of facts, explaining real ones."
   <br>&emsp;What I have then is a flowing idea, on of which is grafted onto the current continuity of things; and at that, remarks upon the flow of things that have preceeded this current step, and at that the fairly conceived steps forthcoming. "By virtue of what holds predictive strenght, namely reason and its obituary of points already come."
   <br>&emsp;As a quick note, Hume says that nothing can be known but that which we concieve; for even in our supposition of what something else is, so are the terms and notions which we (more or less) use to color it born from our prior experience. "Which itself also brings to question the nature of our paint: a mystery indeed of that which so mysterioulsy colors itself." No matter, my point is supposing how things are on a basic level is, with practical entirety, based on neccesity, musts, assumed reasoning for that which has come to be. Only, that property, of assuming the basis for exlpanation is liable to fallacy in a similar way as Hume concerns us with the mystery of our external regard. 
   <br>&emsp;I could explain, and have written this more plainly and well. But of this final point, I think the figure of it is sufficient. At least, unlike some portions of prose, of Hume's inquiry regarding limits, and my own remark of reason's basis, so could I in fact explain the meaning. And by this private nature, I'll let the clarity already given bear its state of suffice.

<div id="ledger">
   The obituary of reason is in some sense a ledger, of all points which came and have passed. It would seem then, that such points, at least those in the ledger, hold the current possibility of evidence -from observation. Barring some details, we could say that, for predictions sake, that which has come will, or is at least fair to correlate with, that which will come. 
   <br>&emsp;Where there is some sticky buisness is when we consider the 'reasoning' for something, which is not based on what has already come. As it were, what is not of the ledger, is not of existence, or ingrained to the flow of continuity currently present. Such accounts are of contrivance -not a pejorative. This is indeed a starting argument, for of all points which have come, and of that one, or layer so to speak, which began, so is the contrived basis for that seperate from the continuity it afforded. 
   <br>&emsp;Evidence then is via existence, or things that is: of that which is. And the piecemeal nature of this may be described as an ocean of events; while the aggregate form may be a mere foramility of unison, whereby those piecemeal events associate with others. At that, comes a key parameter for meta-reasoning, which is, of the reasoning which it is the meta for, so ought the subjects of such inquiry be suitably identified. And, namely, there is a solid statement of modern times, which is, that events are the things we are seeking the basis for, and that of such events, there more or less perceived timeliness and the supposed beginning, is in fact not so exlpicitly set to presumably fair notions, but rather, the nature of time and duration as observed, and the otherwise inquisitive regard of such properties -as compares to contunuity within infinite sets- is not obviously congenial to any common notion of beginning. And, at that, as for the question, 'well, of such thing then, how is there origin, however you look at it?'. And here the second principle of modernity comes to play, in that, of the event which you are questioning, so is the basis for the question, about its origin, encumbant within the event in question; and at that, the mystery is one of identity, as opposed to an explanation of something fully defined.
</div>
<div id="taskofreproach">
   I am vulnerable to our waivering peculiarities. On one hand, those oddities are fair, in that reason has married herself to our sake, and our troubles are not so far and wide accordingly. And indeed, there is very little discontent which comes from this. But, there remains a need for the basics of living, and at that a remedy of this due to its impact on our interests. And such interests have become our heart and way; perhaps, in part, because our mending of the nearest troubles, opens our sight to things equally close. "while those subject to the pangs of foreign command, seek things of an equally far sort."
   <br>&emsp;As it were, receding from our wants, on both the backs of suitability in what we are right to earn, and otherwise levelling of our actual self regard, as not to be as ill tuned in that, makes such a state welcome. For indeed, our wishes come from a mix of deep and or whimsical passion, but passion no less. Our calmness and content reaches for little though, and at that pursues all but what draws our eye, and through steps which merely approach, as if the cue was a positive one truly.
   <br>&emsp;But we come to this issue when our dimmness seeps in, in part due to the develoment of our self regard and our proclivity to ignore it as the aims which it has procurred become both disposed by us and accepted by others. "like we are now on the path we seek, and can celebrate, like most other's do." And in fact this is fine, for our need for something outside our selves does not push us to deserve it by being perfect, and we even ourselves out otherwise with the actual interests which guide our care. "As opposed to letting our wobbling ways ingrain the wishes that come from them." What I see then, is that the world seems both far and wide, and full of noise and tumult. Our generous and tender gait takes little of this in, and at that more lightly responds, as if it were the wind. But as we stiffen, however locally fine, so do the cries and pedantry of various sources around hit me with more gratuity and luggingness. Due souly from the fact that our reception of anything is according to the stiffness of our selves as recpient. This is indeed a wearisome state. For the troubles of the world are in fact continous with all of things, and together at that. And from this, our fullest cares extend not but more than the frailness of future care and ordinance. Which, as if a grip on the matter, we've truly settled into our personal way, and seen the substance of oru future (as such a concern is drawn) within actual positions of provision and care. This is not some reasurance but an identity within  our moments of a looser sight, where our place farther ahead is gleemed -and of the shapes they seem contributory, rather than what our brilliance receives. 
   <br>&emsp;By this, I am merely remarking upon the real world, and at least how its progress and extent squash these pedantic remarks. Yet, besides the grim and rancourous states which these kind of apprhensions can be, so is our more fair and common state (of this sort) more incidted and weighed upon by the choices of others around me. Indeed, there is little which sparks such a concern on the street, at work; nor is there any real regard for much at home. But, people are subsrcruved to news outlets in a comparable manner as those who are part of a church. Its their source, their inlet for some worldly remark. And the issue it seems, is in our relation to the ones watching, rather than what is being expressed. For indeed, I care not about someone who's house is on fire; nor do I care about some fibre on the parchment of democracy -as I tend to hold the flattess regard as remarks the equal flatness of the whole garb. But when my folks, or their folks, or someone on a zoom call, or even a co-worker who says, 'ya, apparently that's whats going on', I truly panick, as if I am to agree, tell them that their inquiry is off, or I pass their prescence and attend to the truth I otherwise see, and all the trouble which comes from such commissery. And indeed, it is hard to hear this. For I relate to these sort of notions in that, of their identity, the color is off; and as for what it means, so is there an abscence of all regards beyond the position at hand. And such a lack of continuity marks the weakness of the actual strand, and its place amongst others. 
   <br>&emsp;With so little to see then, it is usually our own ignorance which fails. For sensibility, be it of how things are, or reproaching from the thin expression, is a balancing act with no cease. Like our personal ways, one of the reasons that our indolence is so poor is that our relations to others around feels obscure. Simply, our wishes reveal themselves as faulty, or at least unpromising as our confidence wains. And otherwise, if we obstain from the contrieties to our actual way, so are their excrements of seperation; at least, in our less than ripe state, so do others viamence, nievety, rose tinted suggestions and otherwise opinion that remarks a hole in the realm, ware against me. In some way, the view from others that acts without respect to the pastures of our near life, sparks trouble when such grasses are not trimmed, and we in some way feel unable to inhabit this ignored state. For being obscure is a matter of reception, in that if we are steady and vital, so may we firmly yet regally share our views and cares, as to feel good in offering our actual intent, and the solidarity this brings, and otherwise inputing others suggestions with a repsonse of about our interest elsehwere; and this removes any sense of defense or frustration.
   <br>&emsp;When we are not so steady or light though, people's given remarks feel presumptuous, as if our cares otherwise are taboo or off. For we are left with a muddy disposition, which cares not for what is being offered, but cannot speak for what it does. And in some comparable way, others worldy views seem presumptuous, and at that, oblivious to the fact that we don't see things that way. Perhaps, this is why those who are close cause such a struggle, as strangers ask little from you, and are owed little at that. While our friends and family deserve much more, and require it at that. This is why wishing for something from them beckons under our twist of communication. For the repor is more or less off. At that though, there comes this auxillary point of needing to communicate with your parents; and being on good and clear terms is one aspect which remarks a healthiness to our relationship's complexion. In that, one of the things that one must learn to do, particularly when the difference of age is such that our personal efforts and level headed view of the world don't give a strict alignment, that we would be able to communicate what we really seek, how to describe our doubts, or at least suggest that there are details which govern some fair reservation or concern. And, where I'll end, beyond our ability to politely and honestly say no, and all considerations alike, so would it be fair and fruitfull to be able to understand where their coming from, and at that, input a fair expression of their actual place. For when I see them watching the news, I see a group, a company, a meeting; one of which their privy to. But thats all it is. Their merely attending a meeting. Their part of a team. And considering how much they actually say of the matter, it brings a breezy cheer to us, in that the value of a team and its impact beyond the buisness it conducts, is such as not to warrant much fear or resentment, especially when are folk are but almost no responsive to it. Their hearts may be corrupt, and their opinions may be angled. But so is this a matter of communication. Indeed, the trouble of hearing the news or scrolling through twitter is that the thinness and vaguery of the medium depicts the world in a fragmented and chaotic way. And by that, we feel like we are witnessing something terrible, and are uninvovled at that. "Like were hiding from a threat which everyone else is stairing at." This indeed gives us a seperation feeling. And it would seem, that if we simply saw this as something our parents were privy to, and accepted that, then what they were watching would not hold this commanding force, and bear us reptence from igrnoring it. And, at the very least, softening this awkward edge, would let us focus on how our partnets actually are and feel. And surely, they say little. And of what they really think, it really comes to fruition in their own reservations and advice. But so are we then tasked wtih the delicay of reproach and consideration. Which is a position, compared to humouring the teleprompter, that I'd prefer being in. "Let the world be as it is, and all those who are defined otherwise, let their acts be a subject to you, rather than us having to ignore and or repudiate the source. Let the world be vast as it is, and remain flat despite these eratic depictions. For I believe that our place amidst such point where repudation is the care, is such that we are not able to settle back while others here something which our actions don't respect. For in that, our communication is garnered on us being able to reason as such. But let us do so; and to those who we deal with, their views can be as they are, along with those who initially express. For the problem thus, is neither theirs or the recpients concern, as the world flattens their at most idealistic aims away, and remains progressive in a normal way. What we are left with, is not fear of pedantry and opinionative impact, but in speaking to those who feel such way. For in my view, the world is levelled, and remains fairly constant. And at that, of those who handle some measure of fibre, so is the brevity of that nearly minor -considering how many of the 300 million americans care. Effectively that is, for all who in fact do, or have some passing care, their actual impact in its fullest marshal is but a twink of the quilts fibre; and otherwise, beneath this full marshal, they are subject merely to those opinionated around, and at that, fall forward into their own opinions, or are apprhensive about others. Such a state of relations though, is quite an aggregate amidst other groups, who surely vary in their ideal proclivites. And so if we are part of that, or at least the gorup were part of has some tang of such proclivity, than our task is not to say that their wrong; for our sense that it is is not governed or built by such forcefull and sure actions. But rather, at least it would seem, that we let fools be fools, while we remain their friends, and hold no illseated wish from them, nor frustration in dealing with them normally. For we need only the clarity, composure and understanding to offer the cares, concerns and regards, for the interests, needs and pursuits which, to us, actually matter."

   The issue with modern discourse is that it is quite poor in sticthing the topics of converstation with the many strands of the world around. 
   <br>&emsp;Now, if their is discussion about some specific matter, or some generic view of something broader, is the actual topic not of important? Even if it is represented poorly, and through a poor medium at that, ougth we ignore? 
   <br>&emsp;This is indeed our struggle. For the problems which are, and the way the world really is, in some ways warrants a view which is vast, delicate, continous and reputable as that. But, when we are drunk so to speak, or complacent, so do we have little views. And at that, those who  have the crumbiest of views, still rise above me. And at that, our regard for them, comes from a sort of lazy repudation, as if to say theeres no issue, let me sleep. Only, there is an issue; its simply far away. 
   <br>&emsp;And this is where family and fortune come in. 
   <br>&emsp;What do we do then? Place their expression and our folks reception of it fairly.  But see, however fair or eradict the sentiment is, that it is entirely near term, and quite irrelevant to the far off changes that come from the continuity of things. Were talking about a single step. 
   <br>&emsp;So do we relax, level our view of this as to be agreeable and considerate, and otherwise let the near term be guided by pundants and idealists? Worrying about how little the moment even impacts the millions of strands seems unimportant, for the change of those takes decades, if not centuries. And, weirdly, as our composed stance bears remarks to that, so does our drunken state even, or tipsy one rather, still keep up with that.

   So I am surely not a scientist, or a mathmetician, nor a good thinker to any solid degree. I merely ask nice questions, and remain aloft while doing so as to add further suspciion and detail. Indeed, as these do come about, I often find them reptuable; and at that, I tend to give myself some credit as to the strenght of our inquriy. But like all thinks, it pays more to know what you don't know, for that which you do is in some ways dealt with. And, as one who's aim is merely to expand themselves, and perhaps the range of things, so is my survey and brick laying in need of more than pure producitivty and craft, but sensibility and fair regard. In other words, if I am putting on a show, then my blemishes may simply be hidden by our outward shine. But, if I am to remain ordinary, and merely mark the scenery as it is not yet known, then so am I suitably limited by how well I contain myself in such an umbridled approach. For in common pursuits, the response of other's is the limiting factor. And indeed, or self assurance comes from the credit I give myself upon my inquiries; and, our meager hope for other's to respond to this well leaves me tinkering over the product in question. But when the charter of our efforts is set in a more dear and scholarly way, then we are but a man with curiosity, and delight at his fielding discovery. These sorts of developments may be large, but their strenght and character is pleasing only for a man. While the inventor of the toilet saw great praise by virtue of the utility he offered, our regards are akin to a painting, whereby the lenght of our care is such as only to be seen when the mass of it finally stands up tall. "As if we were painting it all this time on the ground." And by that, someone else may see: but so will our eye be past that line, and into somewhere farther. By that, we are  leaving a wonder, an insight to mystery; and is if guided by some constant care for receptivity, be it of validation of our satisfaction, or the remedy of the enclosure which such a awry life can bring, so do we stain our posterity with fidelity. If, perhaps, only to further guide us in some way: for the pursuit forward as drive by our interest, holds much of its plan and care within the respects of what has already been given. And be it honor, that lingering hope to be received, or the support which these established norms can bring, as we pursue a path which is otherwise entire, but unclear. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, our core reproach away from unfair certainty is in the descriptivie suitability, of how we would seemingly best describe things, and otherwise not take for granted that such arrangments are not simply guided by mechanics, but that of their actual base and origin, that such neccessity is contemporaily off. And the example I give to portray this is a real clever one, but is quite effective in laying out the difference. You see, an interaction between things remarks a sort of law, at least on the premise that such interactions apprea consistent. And by that, there seems a line of cause and effect, as if the outputs of such laws can be traced, and at that derive the function which they (the actions) are representative of (or marshalled by). This, frankly, is the root of science, and its depth of moving complexitiy. But you come to this awkward question, as to what procurred either A) the laws, or B) the initation of them and that material which is subject to them; and at that, as C) if the laws are in some sense material, then how are they seperate from the matter which we see subject to them, and at that, what is that matter truly, or basically rather, composed of? And this indeed is the meager question of ontology, which in many ways summarizes itelfs in the tradtional notion of 'ex nihol', meaning 'something from nothing'. And of this, there is much which can be otherwise explained, by virtue at least of the primary rule of modernity, namely that of the objects we conceive, that regarding them as events is souly suitable; and that of such events, the mystery of their origin is so as to be part of their nature, and at remarks a faintness in the questioning of their nature as if such nature was properly known; meaning, in otherwise, the origin of an event, whose origin in fact is encumbent within the event, and at that is a false question, seeing as the subject in question is not identified without the actual property being sought, and at that, fails to be an actual subject which can be questioned. "Where is the red in this red apple?" Its simply an oddity. And, on top of that, is that of the events which we seek, and incopletely identify, that our notion of origin and duration, which we suppose within its identity, or more basically try and define, that of such notions, contemporaily at least, so are such remarks fairly antiquated, in a way that compares to the questioning of continuity within either space and time; and as those questions were dealt with in the late 1800s by Peano and Cantor through developing set theory, so has the reality which the pieces of nature appear to be reminiscent of, hold no features or place that warrants a notion of 'beginning, or duration': at  least as is commonly or tradtionally supposed. "For time is measurable of the bodies which we are asking the origins for. But as each property seems comparably, in the tick tockiness at least, so is the character of it in the actual subject, not as such as to color the character of the property in which the common question often supposes."
   <br>&emsp;This indeed is all to remove neccessity, for such wish to find such is really an appeal to finality, and the absolute. Which seems quite arrogant and immature, as if being inquistive is falsely favorable. And I am not sure where I put this, but a notion of contrivance comes to be, in that, of the explanations for how things, be of this or that matter, came to be. For indeed the 'beginning' question may be poorly placed, but so is the basis of nature a mystery then. And whichever proprties are used to properly define, so are such insights currently unknown. But, one of the oldest tools in the books, is in saying that, of that which is, it is so for it must be. And that, of the current motions of things, they are not such as born from basic web of things which has been continously proprogating. No. Instead, the beginning of things, and introduction of substance at that, was introduced, on the basis that of such beings, in time or body, could not, as is supposed, come from nothing. And of this ancient point, I say that in some ways the suggestion is fair; for the mystery of origins is hazy otherwise. And, at that, the arbitrariness of existence would then be a clear insight, for the product of it would simply be a result of those contrived laws. Perhaps, our discovery of gravity was all there was, and was indeed the source of the substance which we were a forcefull arrangment of. And having both the gravity and material introduced would be quite assuring, for the roots more or less would be in check, and our only task would be to describe its output. 
   <br>&emsp;But, I have this pure example, and at that a mark of weakness for such suggestion. Simply, as things are, they generally remark development. And, of this, there is the modern notion of aggregates, and how in fact, the bodies we see are but binding sets of baser pieces; and like a spider web which forms concentraed strings and hollows when put in a box, so is the large scale clustering of the universe (and its branches) a mere result of that. As such, the objects in question are that, which upon slight anisotropic differences, produced complex aggregation. And indeed that layer of fabric and its strands are what we see. But where I find meta-reasoning, or neccessity, weak, is that at all points of depth, and points of progress within the development of material, there is not one position where an argument of contrivance would be less fitting than the other. Firstly, there is almost entirely no strenght in suggesting that our contemporary view of evidence and its drawn reasoning is a true threshold which the most basic of neccessities is fit for. Not only are their facts which we have a figure for, but dont inwardly know, so is their an objective line of supposition, which beyond the flatter curve of acquiring new facts, that even beyond, and curved about (by virtue of the waivering nature of predictions), that we would make new discoveries and insights, or at least understood more from what we already knew, as to more reasonably anwser those ontological questions. Which, in other words, means that our view of the lighter portions of the world may expand, and indeed their are evident mysteries; but too, of the depths, may we further discover, or at least reasonably suppose. While those pawning neccessity seem to sit in such depths, and offer a neccessary basis for the lighter levels above. Beyond the mechanicsm by which they do so, and how within the realm of light we deeply suppose, there is this question of contrivance, and whether it is indeed the explanation of nature? And by my account, the contrivance which the respectable state of modernity has drawn, is such as to be equally merritable as slotting in the contrivance at any prior point of development. For all contrivance says, is that of the substance and motions which are, their state so to speak, was introduced. And like a ball which may in fact be rolling because it was let down the hill, so would the placement of the ball half way down the hill and with the motion that it would otherwise reaosnably have, produce the same subsequent steps. Surely, we have evidence for their being a higher point on the hill; and consequently, we've lit the depths beneat the point which once seemed a threshold of mystery, and at that a level for contrivance. Modernity perhaps has merrited itself as being so deep, that its evident depths may seem to go no further; and at that, contrivance has what is factually a root level; and at that, a threshold whereby contrivance can then settle in. "For surely, discrete particles and their promulgation into complex structures was merely introduced." 
   <br>&emsp;I could say then, that the nearness of real modernity is such, that the magnitude of its grandeur is such that little may be seen further than by those who are curious; as their is indeed so much observed complexity and physcality, that of such a reputable basis, which is to say a deeper level in which contrivance can then afford, that seeing any level below is difficult. But this is a fairly pathetic attempt on contrivances part; as it almost is too comfortable in the barren realm in which it has been pushed to exist it: 'as if, finally, no more, I can finally settle here. I miss the heavens though'. But time will go on, and the existence which contrivance is meant to afford will become further complicated, and less needing of contrivance. Moreso, especially, will the beliefs of the past, which held confirmation based on the shallow levels of reasoning which their contrivance then mightily implored, will further be reduced, to points where not even the idea of contrivance holds any sway, and at that any acceptibility to the contrartieties that a rational view of nature deplores. In other words, the character of theology continously looses its garb, and becomes nothing more than a minor fact; as if a pinnacle fact, which did nothing more than push to dominoes, whose falling lead to a complexity which is entirely and, with scales for acceptiblity, known. Poor miracles and superstition: how art thou to be when all that is contrary is surely known. Where can we be now that our own being is deemed antiquated, nor favorable? For modernity gives eternal rest, by its deepest base.

   So Hume remarks about a man ontop of a moutain, who, in such heights is demonstrating their virtue and prowess. As he says, 'the turblenet waters below don't scathe his tranquilitiy'. But here, there is the notion of compassion, and how such a person, pleased and untainted, notices the taint of others, and at that finds relief through compassion: as if an ointment to their sympathy. To me, this reflects a line, where the plainess of reality is seen and you are fine to personally be; while the shifting of such line causes you to become burdened with the images and or foresight of other people's suffering. 
   <br>&emsp;In a way, the news, and media in general, provokes a large amount of compassion; that, or it invokes poltiical concerns. On the one side, I am fine to let them swoon over the struggle of someone misfortuned in a fire. While we are otherwise at peace with their expereince, for I see it comparably to how we deal with expereince: which is indeed not so dramatic or perilous. How many times does someone, upon misfortune, say things are ok, or 'were strong and will get through this'. The news ignores the actual meaning behind this, in common things at least. They shower the situation with compassion, and this is great, and hardly something for me to feel awry about; in that, seeing the scenario for what it is, a mere misfortune and its progress from people, I am ok for others to be overly compassionate. Where things get muddy is when the scenario is less specific, and more broad, and at that, there is a call for change -as if a product of compassion. This is quite obscure, for the attention of those who hear things of the sort, is impactfull in imaginativ ways, and hard to dispell as something less strict.
   <br>&emsp;All I can say, is that when Austin Bats comes on, its like were on the wave of life and time, and at that at one with the world as we see. And indeed such a world is massive, and at that unsaturated with any putrid severity. But when we rest, so is that pace hard to retain; nor is our complacency something which ushers imaginative impressions away. Triggers of imagination are as merritable as you'd expect, and consequentail at that. Yet we may be trapped in it. And part of me says that the path moving forward is one where we are privy to the whole world, and upright enough to see it forwardly, nor to brazen in our rest as not to retain congruency to it when our pace slows (and the mass of it all is felt). That, and the imagination of what others see, and how our own sympathy gets derailed when we are not privy to the real world, seems a point of closure, as if our ignorance of certain things leaves holes for imagination to sit in. Its not a final sentiment, as our adaptive ways bring us further to see fully, and at that more stabily rest. But, as we respond to things by virute of our forward cares, so can those things which our instbailities bring, be tempered themselves. "For our shortcomings bring much horror; yet, as those horrors become clearly ficitious, as the size of register becomes huge, then so is the illusory nature of them easier to change: for their brevity holds no strenght." In that, as in all things, I merely be, honestly; and perhaps by gain in being so, further remove the trggers which unsettle such commisery. As we did with our aims of philosophy, so is our perpetuity of practice in need of its remedies: which is, for one, tailoring of the ill practiced wishes and whims, as to move forward withtou fear of what you wont recieve; and secondly, but noticing the hostility and or apprhesnions which comes when our practice is ill placed (and at that mistake).
   <br>&emsp;Indeed this is a strange notion, whose source is not entirely known. If we are well practiced, then our delusion will not settle in; even though there is falsity and a juvenile disposition which springs at any slip. As it were, we always slip, and at that, humour the edges of such proclivity as our composure is less then secure. So we know their there. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps its the reason for tending to these things which is awkard. For they don't contribute to your pleasure, directly at least. "As the ultimate friction that they bring so much as your are imperfect, and prone to mistep at that, means that your path will become wobbled and diffuclt to reoirent. So theres reaosn in that sense." But, perhaps these hidden fears and apprhensions are a significant matter for how your commonly be, in that, of your wish to be generous, and social, so is a falsity in the framework of that libale to murky your actions in that: equal to how a falsity regarding the structure of yourself murkies your efforts there.
   <br>&emsp;Ultimnaely, there may be a private connection in all of this; in the sense that of our generosity, that it is somewhat done as concerns us. But at that, there seems more room to expand and consider, these layers as are prevalent in us. For the attention of things seemingly personal, may be things like these which have to do with others: and at that, the relation to ourselves may indeed be whats present, but wortwhile surely then.

<div id="baseforremarks">
   So, my theory of existence is balanced by several tenants. Foremost is the rule of discourse, and that because we are coming from a point prior to what is becoming known, and are likely incomplete in a final sense, so do we need the ability to give regards to entirety, but without any apprehension about the limits of our regards. Here, the notion of auxillary points come in. For instance, if two people are discussing what someone says, they likely are not considering the basis of language in their discussion. Even then, the rules of speech are not likely given regard either, but rather circumstantial information, and perhaps some common rules of converse. At that, beneath the relevant facts and conduct of the social realm, the auxillary point is what divides our remarks between the basis of that, and the fundementals of the elements in question. In a similar way, one may conclude that the formation of the universe and its structure is soley due to slight anistorpies in particle fields; and that of substance, there is merely the latter; while the auxillary point of this, is in regards to any baser mechanics and formation of the definite material, along with its ontological basis. In other words, auxillary points, albeit misplaced perhaps in the word, but in definition is fine, are to remove the common 'what abouts' within primary matters. For I do not know the basis of everything; yet, of the point right above such edge, I can say that the regards, for instance, of man's origin, is far derived from such primary layer, as is the case for most of the higher structuers we see.
   <br>&emsp;Besides that, we come to the core issue of material, and the distinction between aggregates and the real piece meal nature. Simply, nature, in a primary sense regarding material, is made of particles; and via baser laws, or the effects of other particles, so do certain accumulations occur. In this, we refer to the basis as the ultimate root of origins and constituency, while, placing an auxillary point of such quesiton, and refering to the piece meal view of the material as we effectively see, that of such material on that smaller basis, we say that our regards are of a finer sort; while those of aggregates are of something akin to a higher sort, in that of those finer elements, so are their aggregates merely concentrations of those. And at that we say that, ostenstively, they are derived. For although the basics of the laws are unknown, it is more or less understood that a soul particle will exhibit effects that are merely aggregated in the case of several particles. And to some extent, beyond magnifying the laws by some exponential factor, it is a fairly suitbale part of one's regard with respect to nature's complexion, to see that, akin to a fish in a sholl, that each fish is indeed acting, and exhibiting at that, as its own entity; and that only due to the clumping effects of the finer pieces, do larger, and perhaps more complicated effects occur: but souly as clumps of each particle's effect. Binding this, again with an auxillary point of the ontologiucal sort, but equally too of the baser laws which we'd think uself for our descriptions, is the well understood point that of the finest matter and its social origins, that the members of such clique were unevenly distribubted due to the slight differences of dark matter and radiation. Simply, as the substance of matter formed, so did the attachment of baryons with dark matter release some radiation; and, consequently, produced what is know as oscillations; and from these ripples came, as you'd imagine the space between two mountain peaks, pockets, where the solidfying matter would settle; and the distribution of these pockets was such, that where they were, and by whichever distirbutive degree, that so would matter accumulate as proprtionatley as the pockets secured. The auxillary point of origins, be it ontological in the purest sense, baser in the physical sense, or objective in the evident sense of the big bang, that so, in these pockets, was there an anistropic, or uniformly uneven dsitribution, whereby the accumulatio nof matter was slightly higher in certain spots, and at that held further accumulation -through gravity. This is the origins of galaxies, and at that the realms for stars, planets and all things they house.
   <br>&emsp;The final point builds on this process of structure, and simply remarks how such process is continuous, and at that consequent for any subsequent forms. Again, the origins of this process and the ingredients its composed of is unknown, and at that set for further discovery and inquiry: but our auxillary point stands: for if such source is contrived or reasonable, so is the existence which it procurred a continous one. Even if such existence was introduced in such a state, that of our trace back to it we concured that it did indeed go further, that even the we would still be right to ascertain the continuity from that introductory point: and at that the continuity of things moving forward. By my account this is the troubling tenant, for the proof of it is quite uncertain so long as our absolute basis of things is unknown. But indeed, I find that even the querkiest of theories don't contradict any evidence of constance. For evdience is indeed a reputable pivot to swing around, however incomplete its conclusions are. I just don't think theres any effect on the evidence beyond the depth of its understanding. At least, my grasp on the evidence, as nieve and lay it is, is only doubtfull of the lenght in which such evidence could reach back to, in the sense of origins. There is not but a glimpse of recognition in my mind, as to the possibility that nature, as it inscrutibaly appears, is in fact disspraportion in its otherwise seeming comparabilities; and at that, is not in unison, regarldess of the contrived or reasonable basis. I would like to say that things are continous, for much, if not all is explained, or accepted at least by the notion. But I cannot say for sure in a positive sense. And indeed that is fine, for I dont need to conclude the simplicity by which our humanity came to be. But I admittedly sense a sign of intelectual gratuity, in that, of such simplicity and its source from continuity, that of others who see the subject for explanation as different, besides the reasoning for it, so in that I see a inappropraite retreat from continuity; as such a tenant almost surely warrants and, albeit generally, explains the formation of the structures we now see: and at that validates what the structures are. Which is the tricky notion. For, in regards to our minds for instance, the shortcomings of this is such that our confusion about how the natural mind came to be is such as to permitt doubts of what the mind is. There is almost no good reasoning for what the mind is deemed otherwise; but our lack of understanding as to how the evident mind has become, gives way to antiquated views of the subject in question; and, admittedly, so merrit of the reasoning for that alternately described entity. 
</div>
<div id="contrived">
   When we think of the continuity of things, we see a process which offers predictive strenght, based on the events already procured. And, as we understand such events, we can further trace their origins. As if, 'hey, this is how this is working, and, hey! look at that over, it must be the cause'. Such insights bring our understanding into a state of harmony.
   <br>&emsp;But as we mentioned, there is this contrived possibility for things, in the sense that of a ball rolling down the hill, that so is it presumed to have come from a certain spot, and moved via the slope and gravity, accelerating at that; and at least from the point observed and its motion'd state, so can such a state be traced back; and recedingly to, as the point prior may be shown to have been the cause of the current, and so forth to the second priod point, which procurred the first prior; and, in some sense, has a lower origin, or baser one rather, of the higher moment. But, despite these events and or motions being consequences of prior causes, so is it possible that such causes were arbitrarily placed. And, from this, there is no real reason for such contrivance to be in one spot or the other; only, that in this sense, the introduction brought the object into a state of motion already. And of this contrived notion, there is a clearly faintness too it, for it offers little in terms of an explanation, as there is no discrimnate placement of the contrivance; and better yet, there is no proof of a contrivance, only a plausibility. Yet such plausibility works in any number of ways. As the point really, is that of the moment we now see, its state is reminiscent of a prior process; yet determining the existence of such line is plausibly arbitray, as by virtue of the contrived notion, any point of that line could have begun with that state of motion present; and at that progressed as what we now see.
   <br>&emsp;This may all seem quirky and strange; but without any definite reason as to why there cannot be such contrivance, its plausibility remains. Beyond this though, as regards continuity, we tend to think of our flow of things as congenial with all others, and at that, communal in the entirey of all things -forming a total realm. But, as if a snapshot of a coral reef and all its moving parts, that besides seeing the state of such a situation as derived from plausibly contrived points, that so may each point be differently contrived. How things come together is an immediate concern, but indeed, it could be that something was introduced with a brisk pace, sped up, slowed down, and at any rate retured to a level state of the process which led to our seemingly normal moment. In many ways the laws of physics are hard to exclaim, for their basis is not on anything but the faith in reason (or evidence). But how would one know, even if they understood the mechanics of light, that such a input from a source seemingly far away (by virtue of light's speed), that there was not some trick being played, and that the rules, or orderliness and natural fortuity, was awkwardly non linear and loopy: and at that, not so mechanistic in a progressive sense, but rather contrived and arbitrary. Or in other words, how do we know that our observations are not in fact but moments who suggest what, in a linear sense, would cause them, but in fact are due to but nearby moments of linearity, but otherwise loopily based in the prior, if not earliest stretches. Who has the reason to otherwise claim consistency? Is it perhaps the breadht of our register, or tally of evidence rather? Is it maybe the compatibility with all the current insights? For even if our understanding is wrong, and things are in fact loopy and contrived, can our current moment not be taken as if it were normal and natural? And at that, when we bring all the objects of this moment into one mingling observation, and we see that they are all inline with the process which we presume, does this not at least, for one, warrant a union of things within a state, however previoulsy contrived? And indeed, science may perhaps be what limits us from even doubting the constancy of our observations; for in our insight of the things which we are reckoning, so are our limits there not so permitting for awkward doubts; moreover, by further defininf what things are in a true identitive sense, so may the cause of our questioning be discerned, and at that cuurative of our otherwise baser doubts. But, indeed, the fairest reason, is a combination of the two, in that, of our identities, so may we not fully doubt less we know what the subject is which were doubting; and concurently, if we then knew enough to fairly doubt, or question at least, that part of the identity of the subject may inherently describe the mystery in question. And indeed, this sort of fullness to our inquiry marks a point where the leary doubts that otherwise hold their arbitrary head, loose their lustre and appeal, and at that begin to wilt like baked lettuce.
</div>
<div id="primarybounds">
   Just as a steady heart makes threats and trouble deed like as compared to burdens, so is any expected harm or mistreatment of people equally so, that in a reasonable and levelled out way, is akin to the former and not so much the latter. As we like to say, severity is a scaling cause, and at that, prevalent in varying scenarios. But so are such events but a selection of many; and at that, home to their according consequences, be it peace or severity. And at any rate, regardless of the prevalance for these kind of events, and the outcome within them, that such results are akin to the pangs of deeds, and not those of burdens. This, is awkwardly diffiuclt, for our ease in seeing how things are, is so as only to be disgruntled and prone to certainty, if only to allievate the plausibility of 'a burdened mindset' and the gratuity which it assumes, and at that from our ignorance which permitts such thinness.
   <br>&emsp;I say this for our mind is such as to be free and set locally, and personally at that. For I make no claim that we are merely fine because our life is particualarly great, but rather because of all scenarios, so are set on a fair view of it. Which, indeed, is something easier to understand in unsevere situations: but the levellness is entire. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps the problem is that the leaks in our own life are not such as to require so much attention, that we in fact forgo other regards: as if our concerns are so clear and evident. Instead, we are in many ways tigthening loose knots, of screws which lie deeper than what is rightly apparent. This brings in some unease, as the far reaches of our life take on a precedent, beyond those of folk around, and their own surface level lives. Our motions are such as not to procurre a finer pace, and at that a flow of things which is beyond those minute self interests, and at that can be one with the pace of the broader world. Most worries and predictions fall beyond this, and become heated and apprhensive based on their forward bend. Which is not something I care for. Nor do I believe that most people act on these in any genuine way. But, in our overly reproached way, so does our ignorance of hwo the world is make way for those 'showy' views to seem more effective and actual then our fairer senses would suppose. Here is the source of our restless clarity, as if to remove the plausibility for our ignorant inflammations to take on any form.
   <br>&emsp;Within this broader outline, sits a relatively personal complex, one of which holds a good mixture of comfort and peace near its primary bounds. At that though, we seek to reconcile the reality in which were placed in. I think that occupation is such as to iron out our personal looseness, and at that bring us away from the overly tense and or scrupulous regards for the further space around us. This is better spent in curoisity, rather than relief. But our practical remarks are such, as to be, upon relfection, limited by our lack of friends, and effort at that. Since our amends find themselves bent on the prudent roots of our prior era, and the goods which such ways procure, so do we see our path forward as a dull one in a basic sense, but lush through the broader strokes of time. Indeed this can be weary, barren, and at that tense, as we feel the weight of our seperation. But here lies our wish to attend things; as our finer ability is quite attuned to notice what is actually relevant to our case, and at that the various degrees by which our minor ways produces apprehesnion.
   <br>&emsp;For starters, there is no anticipation by us to be rich or well received. And any concern of this not being so, is remedied by there being no need to prove ourselves; and our acceptence, personally and by family and friends, of our live progressing ordinalrily, and shining by our dearest regard, is rounding this out, as to remove any fear or apprhension of not being validated in such personal ways, nor our own reservations at removing anically struggles to such sincerity: for the limit of such, in many ways, is the diversion and tear that comes from seperate if not modifying efforts for the sake of validation. Our personal pace and its complexion becomes more varied, intricate, lush and colorfull; and at that, finds more ease in incorpoating the baser elements which our wish for praise and brillaince is staked on.
   <br>&emsp;Ultimately thoguh there is this leary point, and that has to do with our embrace of noramility, and the succession from our ideals, and the according world which we thought our valor would aid. This leaves us with a frettfull view of things; as if we saw chaos, but have lost the brevity to treat it, or our confidence and destiny at least. Painstakinlgy, we then try and describe the world accuratley, as to mend the lefover realm of our retreat. But the foot is before the shoe here, as our contrition is really  constricting our views, however fair they've become.
</div>
<div id="meaningspace">
   It seems that our prior wish to see a brilliant end, is equal to our current sight of relations and public interest. One, however, is baked on a relinquish from self validation and glory. But I still wonder what draws us to have such a sight. Perhaps, in the way that school used to be, and work generally is, that the forthcoming of it is overhwelmingly evident, and unable to be ignored. While now, we are merely regarding a plausible, albeit likely, scenario, where we would then have something to attend.
   <br>&emsp;I think otherwise how our comforts are such, that of their worth we recede from; one reason being our permission to do so, the other of the good it will bring. A fair remark though, is that right now, for instance, I may simply be looking to relax, and at that enjoy something. Our time clearly is spent, and our position to be as we are somewhat trying to preserve, is not for the moment actionable. But this is different that regressing, where you nievly conform to seperate values; which via our disposion, never takes, or is of favor to me. 
   <br>&emsp;Theres just a mix you see. For our future is there, and with little which I'd describe solemly. But the prescence of it is neither demanding  or prominent. ANd for the most part this is fine, for we are not dissapointend with our lack of fantasy. But the flow of our day may seem inconstant. For, one side of it is in one of comfort, or a looser liberty that is. And, generally, this is accpetbale, in both our funds and leisure: as our studies come and go as they please, and for the most part require more patience than prudence. Durability is important, but polish is but a sparkle of our principle; and at that, our scenario is such as not to be in a consatnt shine. 
   <br>&emsp;There lies the problem though. And one which I cannot quite deinfe. It lies in our agreeability, and harmony, within comfort and its looser pace paired with the natural rise of our principles and interests; and at that, our finer peace in our normal surroundings, and that which we merrily see through the route ahead. This contentment is not so much of gratuity but amiability; for our pleasures in this case are mixed nicely with curisoity, leisure and self regard; but none of these wairs down the other; nor do they ask others to take a step back for the others sake. Yet, in this acceptence, there is this lingering state of the world and our place in it. And generally, this isnt a remorse of glory, nor a inflammatory guilt as to some imaginary worry, but rather a pang of seperation, and the illusory sparks this brings. The source though is that disconcernment, which  I can only say extends from the strands of us which are not so iroend out. There is no fear of no glory on my part; nor do I see our curisoity as being destined for or judged against recognition or scrutiny. It is merely our own, and a remark of our complexion as an ordinary man; whose actions are choosen as remarks his stature as being one, the invovlement of which merely shows such complexion by his mere prescence. 
   <br>&emsp;The heart of my thinking then, is so much as that route of me, and its fair and pastural pace amongst the million fibres and strands of the world, is such that so much as it is unrooted, hazily set, and in some sense confused, then its otherwise unobliged or unbravose intent will see it seperate from the world. Which is a reproach best described as idle, but due to a dragging from our ill clairty -as what remarks our appropraition to a finer ground of peace, calmness, steadyness, cheer and stability. "Why is this fine, by me and for me? As much as this is not known, so will we feel pinched between the irratbility of comforts aversion, and our non desire to hastily proceed. And why being is fair and pleasing shows our base pursuit."
</div>
<div id="aggregatemarks">
   So our notion of positive response, is one of flavor, rather than a genuine distcintion of kind. The base of it is, that our sense are such, that foul odors are repellent, as are suspicoously colored fruits and flowers. But as the latter is honed on color, so is there a brilliance which can otherwise be seen; and at that, curry awe and grandeur. The source of this is a ancient one, and at that, seems somewhat unclear. As we can fairly attest to the systems which keep us alert from threats, and bring us to satiety; but why we first looked up at the stars is a real mystery.
   <br>&emsp;We can say though, that for whichever reason, we are still, in our freedoms, drawn. For I feel no threat of starvation or predator; yet am still awry when we aren't doing something. Tradtion may hold our bow here, as she keeps us in check for whats important. But for me, this influence his never been thoughtfull, and of a disciplinary sort. For none of it is banked on what we need, but rather what we are contempable, or ill oppertune, not to get. In many ways wisdom is the retreat from such givens, and otherwise a dissolving into the evident worries and needs; as if one could tell me my hand was hurt when it felt not. And, via or curisoity, as a comparison to the religious impulse, and our general means of removing worry and fortifying our strenght (as a brace and a promise from clarity), we discrimiate and inquire, as not only to live more freely and without concern due to an abscence of evident threat, but more deliberatley explore and define how things are beyond that. Indeed, this may remark finer motions within us, and at that the interarctions we have with folks close to us and the general culture around, but so in that, merritable or not, we find a more reputable truth; as our actions are not only reproached from presumption, but approaching something solid instead.
   <br>&emsp;In a way, this is merely a religous impulse moulder by self regard, rather than tradtion. And indeed, there is little superstition or neccessity which colors our according way. Yet, as all  religions, there source seems to be an awkward remedy of our isolation. For, indeed, tradtion may bolster the efforts of surrounding men, and thus the flow of our own possible motions; and similarly, this flow may be garnered by a lack of self regard and curiosity in men who may not even be so staked in tradtion, but are rather lifeless instead. I find this circumstance the strangest of all; for its profits are such, that being so open to the breadht of nature, so is there a merritable scope to the consquent inquires, and at that a source for brevity and confidence. For indeed, this impulse to secure a truth is in many ways a wish to settle your solitude: which we simply say is the grounds for non-tradition and inquiry. But in our natural strenght which comes from this, so does it tend to lean to far, and become in oppistion to the antiquated notions prevalent. 
   <br>&emsp;But this, as I truly believe, is a result of continuity, and the developments that the constance time brings. For none who have ever inquired, did so outside the common realm; and at that were made somewhat seperate by virute of their non-conformity, and espcially so as the seperation was not merely of aversion, but cultivation -and its favored placed of a working environemnt. And weirdly there are hopes from all in this sort to bring others on board, as the world seems so heavy on their shoulders. Nor, does their lack of cohersion with the common norm make such norms seem foreign and dissarayed; which, like Montainge, breathes much rancour. 
   <br>&emsp;I say we are nearly modern, for the querries of science have still not yeilded us a resolvable truth, as all prior speculative attemmpts have. This current era of inquiry is a vast and discriminate one, but holds no binding beyond its rural ontology. There is still a seclusion to its merrits, and at that lacks much description and practical cohersion. That, and the eshecatology and or meaning behind it all, is such, that warranted in the question, or at least insightfull to what those ancient questions were sourced from, so has our current state offered little solidity.
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps, this is the ease by which we consider the strenght of things, and our ability to wonder and postulate, sourced from our liberty to inquire. And such a line, as it continues itself and solidifes, almost becomes inseperable from the world which we are otherwise inquiring against. As if, all were in a cave, and we instead stood outside, truly seeing. As our sights have gone from suggestion, to form, to reason, and passed even the unruling strenghts of that cavish pedantty, so do walls and aridity of the cavern become inseperable from the world as we truly see. It is not some vista which our place on the ledge is privy to, but rather a proper assimilation of the geogpraphy and reason of which all are part of. This is not even a bold claim by the purest of reason. 
   <br>&emsp;Normally, we would see things differently, and being so drawn, we'd wish to marshal such a portrayal against others: as if it were some argument. One of the rules though of inquiry, is that beyond the validity of explaining the means by which we know, that of what we knew, broadly speaking at least, is soul, set, invariable; and that, indeed, it is the distincction of the recieving instrument which may correspond to different impressions, or responses at that; but from objects which are not, in truth different. Better said, that nature has a way, and is as such in one soul sense. In a scholarly sense, and by the breifest of defintions, pluarlity and monisn accordingly contradict. What we are regarding may render these terms obsolete; but so, even then, of what we regarding and in which sense, so is there a soul entity to the thing in question. 
   <br>&emsp;As we've stated, regarding atoms for instance as entities is all too hollow, as it is merely a bundle of real entities, and as such is not some entity itself. In other words, our identity of thing, may be nominal or of things derived, but is indeed absolute without regards for the latter. And by this, our sense of regard is baked with speculative ingrediants that suitably exhibit the grooves of our question. Namely, describing galaxies for instance and their formation of planets, is not a base question, but a configured one; as such motions are merely aggreates of finer elements. At that, our remarks of such basics is accordinly such, as are our aggregate regards. But so, in our understanding of the principle of things, can we see, how in unison and commradery, that their aggregacy formed the complexes we derivately see. And by that, such distcintion as aggregates and basics would be somewhat unneccassry; for the limits of the latter would not require a proprortionate approach for aggregates; in the sense that as the basics are unknown, then so is the core of the aggregates also; yet in those we still wish to attend; and as we are inquiring to the basics, so may we inquire to the aggregates, but with the sense that our remarks are not principially certain. But when those basics are known, then we need no leniant regards for aggregates, but rather a means of describing how the known basics aggregate. "At that point, such aggregates are, in origin and consitnecy, known on the level of those basics; and, to reiterate, require less presumption in their own effective discourse." 
   <br>&emsp;My point, is that perhaps our inquiry has led to a deeper truth, and at that affords me a leary mix of prospect, obligation, and admittedly confusion
</div>
<div id="beyondreluctance">
   So I know with a fair degree of precision, why I became so self attended. Only now, I am not, nor have I ever really been, so sure as to what such an attunement means. For, commonly, two aspects come to play, namely that of changing the world as to remedy your solitude, or validating yourself be prooving the reason for simplicity, or finding prospects to it, as to more peacefully, and cohabitatively, exist in such a personal way.
   <br>&emsp;In many ways, our abscence from the core of duty, saw little incorparation with the common good around it. And even as our adjustment into our self saw much aversion into working in any common way, so did our ultimate assimilation to it not conjure with it the goods which normally come with it. There were indeed wishes of the normal sort, be it of relations or aspiration. But so, in the everdyay swings of comfort and fun, so were were either averse of unintrigued.
   <br>&emsp;At that, our core of self regard is strange, and indeed is till working itself out. But as to remedy this inclosuvie state, ought we give some regards as to the priotrity of it in the first place. For, my life was such, that our unengagment with any of the traditions placed upon me, saw a relativley high recourse into ourself. Rather than one who was involved, but looked inwards as to find some fufillment, I had none the former, and thus fell fully into the latter. And by this, the merrits of being so self regarded, saw the goods of it root themselves in as our backbone of wishes and respect. And at that, so did any lingering needs of duty acclimizatie themselves with respect to the evdident needs that our core life required. And at that, such a life became the pasture for all coming harvests; no matter the postion or place amdist the common affairs, this never pulled me away, nor swindled me into looking past their ill-fitting for our true interests.
   <br>&emsp;At that, our life has come to be. But indeed the course of it seems off, for we are in most ways shedding the last layer of reluctant ambition and desire, and accordingly settling into our life as it really is, and forging it as to remain as such, and with a growth that can only be described as local and natural. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps there is a simple strangeness to our time, in that the forced amends which our limits drug out from us, hold no more sway. But accordingly we have no amends. And our time is such, that the plainer commitments which we could ripefull seek, are not but a future prospect. And this crevace of simplicity and future activity has me lingering. 
   <br>&emsp;I would say though, that our retreat from over-ambition and expected glory, is too early as to remove you from seeing the future equally. The form of it is different, but are regards for there being a future there still remains; and we simply fill it with fairer elements, as opposed to those which are adolescent. But the future still remains, and at that, so much as such future is deemed, seems but forthcoming, and currently unactiomable. At least prior our ambition was growing, however prior to any defininte position. What I would say, is that the pressure to be so future oriented, left with it a sort of impression and remark when such future regards  left. At least, as the force of our future regards left their grander sort, and our amends were merely of a more simple and public kind, so did the frame of the world which contorted around that broader future view, stay as a sort of implant, when the substance which inflated it left. At that, our milder future remarks seem tense, as the substance, however fair, is not near enough for the prior frame to seem full. And the point is not that our current substance needs inflattion, but rather that it would be close, as there to be substance at all. Indeed, our worldview as remarked our inflated sense of purpose and place, is fine to deflate a little and relax. But the nature of it is such, that of its size it was according to the inflated regard for the future; and as that has brought a substance which equates to a lesser view of the future, so does that leftover sense have little to settle on. At any rate, the pressure is of a balanced sort, whereby the current substance seeks more brevity, or wishes to be met sooner, as to increase its relevance, and anticipatory effect. 
   <br>&emsp;What I am thinking, is that rest is what we need, as to settle into our newer form, whereby the world is seen as it is with respect to our unbravose and far minded way. The future we do see is in most ways closer, but far in a dense sort -by virtue of the immediacy which our less stretched life brings. From this, I would say, that your health marks the vector for constancy, and resituating at that. Of this, regression is the main problem. Principle may change, as can moments cause a decrease in magnitude. But our course remains forward and accordingly bent.

<div id="ofnature">
   It is quite easy to outline a basis for nature. Except, when we then wish to describe the structure of it, or arrangments rather, we realize that our theory is wrong, or premature at that. 
   <br>&emsp;By virtue of our inquiry, and the encumbant approach from not knowing, the identity of things which we'd deem as outputs of nature comes short, as much as that basis of nature is wrong. For indeed, there is no true planet or rock, but the clumpnig of particles; which are themselves the ebbings of basic fields. And in that, our own ignornace of facts and observation make our inquiry somewhat limited. And at that I would be best to refine. But I can say, for the moment, that our notion of nature's basis is such, as to balance the proportions of what we presume it would be, in a conceptual sense, and that of which it is the basis for. As such products in many ways indicate the finer workings which bore them, and at that offer an insight to their source. But so musn't we confuse, or presume, that a certain layer of material is the basis; at least, such material ought to explain the parameters which remark our basic inquiry. "How did such matter come to be, and however substantial, how did it begin to interact, or move at that and procure the aggregates present." In other words, how has a figure, or form rather, of nature and its complexion changed, but of a mere configuration of those baser pieces: what brought them to this point, and are the means to it rational, in that they are understandable, or are they contrived, in that the conduct of such material is ingrained to the core of its principality. In many ways, I believe that this latter notion is pure. Yet, it remains a doubtfull position so long as we are unable to fully make it. Simply, of the events, or evidence, which we deem a product of that mysterious source, that if such subjects are not in fact complete, enduring, or anything but a weaving of some baser assortment, whose conduct is such that it reflects a ontology which can only be describe as 'whithering', then so does the question become one, still, of its means of anisotropy, as to create non-uniform complexity; and, secondly, and foremost, that of the nature which our evidence appears, but is in fact as nature'd as the elements its composed of, how can such fundementals be in such a way, as not to correspond with the apparent conduct of the arrangments which we are privy too? 
   <br>&emsp;For starters, we must remove the nievity of our senses, and the presumption that our observations are anything but higher orders of complexity; and at that, reflective themselves of the objects which they see: but in that, equally unrefined in their principality. Language is a mere remark of signs, and the basis for sounds and perception are not much more than a developing course of nerves and preperation. Beyond our actual anthropic mixture, so are we inquiring, and at that, free to overstep what is otherwise universal and total. Our apprhension reflects a grander mystery, akin to someone struggling to open a coconut; which, as an act, is not much more than a complicate form of chemical reaction. "Like a plant being drawn up towards the sun." 
   <br>&emsp;The point, is that our regard for existence is not so seperate from our state of thinking. And at that, so is such a state, as was once thought, some special form of existence: like a earthly comparions of divine sight. This is folly, and in many ways comes from an inappropriate character within the act of total inquiry. For such an act is best when it is without prejudice to our actual concnern; which is to say, that our ignornace of things less clear then the operation of opening a coconut is overhwlmig, and at that, a source for our heuristic superstitions and nievety. Our fear of not being special, or seperate from the rocks we stand on, is but a momentary relief, as the currents of nature press on. And, as a rock's nature is unclear so much as nature's basis is too, so is our means of inquiring a mere arrangment of that nature, like the rock; and the confusion of us being special is no more than us missatributing our speculation, and such complexiry, for what is really just language; which is, itself, millions of years of progression from the mere chirps of a Capuchin -or the howling of, well. Such acts are not so unique, as are plants not much more, clearly, than the offspring of a different lane of chemisty. But chemical no less. 
   <br>&emsp;And in many ways our troubles come from a lack of inquiry. Which is to say, a proper conduct in our speculative approach, in that we don't fail to ask questions by virtue of their contrariety to observation, nor do we forbid questioning based on prior speculation. The current of nature is all we seek to know, for what will happen, and conseuqnetly our place in it, is contained within that. But nature is indeed constant, at least the complexion of it which we inspect, is of a forward motion: hence the flow, and our wish to know our place on it. But so must our regards respect this fact; as, special or not, we are trying to describe something which appears only to be moving; and at that, our maturity to this state, brings our own inquiry as a kind of relfection, or mirror if you will, of that flow, whereby we are merely a responding strand. If only by language and our according response, we wished to seize the current, and remedy our anxious response. 
   <br>&emsp;Accepting otherwise, that our nature is such as to be part of nature as you have only a the fair right to believe, is such as to remove you from superstition and accompanying conlcisions, and otherwise settle into the simplcity of the mortal issue which spurrs you to be otherwise pernicous. And in such acceptence, we are akin to a prisoner who has foound peace in their place, but still wishes to understand the walls around them. Indeed, this is the trickiest of notions, for our liberty to see and explore is but a propsed state of character upon the banishment of fear. But the merrit of not being afraid is not complete, and at that our ease in being unafraid seems hazy. But I would say, overall, that if we remove the presumptions which come from false conclusions, and at that recede from the motives which were at their core bare, we may actually be in this more lively and vital state, and therefore further our understanding to a profitable degree, or at least be at peace while our mere place in nature is present, until we dissolve into the later ebbs of its current. 
   <br>&emsp;The source of this fact is purely developmental. And, not be exact, but consider if all were told a lie, and disposed themselves to the concliusions according to that; at some point or the ohter, which is the part I cannot say, if someone saw otherwise, as perhpas the truth in things eventuall overhwlems you with its prescence -by virtue of its complexion being actuall lso- then someone being privy to that would only take them to unexplored realms, as nonoe have so far seen it. This is the path to modernity surely, and has been a communal sort of a literary sort, as the true insights of folk was insightfull to those in times far to come. 
   <br>&emsp;My point, is that the questioning of nature is such, that holding things sacred, and namely of ancient gains, is such as not to remark much truth; as, indeed, whatever the truth is, it is drawn from the currents of nature, and her soul complexion. And past knowledge is, fairly, a verification of that; but is surely not anything but. For my impression now, however sifted, is of nature and her soul way; and beyond guidance and direction, so can I see the truth as anyone ever saw it. "While errors and fallacy are nearly unbounded in their complexions." In some sense my points are such as remark the known apprhensions, and the beliefs which have followed. But, besides arguging for that, I merely inquire; relatebly, as our body is fated for an end as all others have passed, and like those who will nearby. But I only say then, that what is relevant to me, is such that it comes from nature's appearence, and how that complexion appears. This then, is the point of specifics, and the adolescent approach of mixing our insight with prior inquiry. But it is a soul one, as remarks the soul nature were attending. And as all projects avail, so are the properties, or techniques of merrit, apparent by their progress: and harmony with the soul of nature seems the right metric.

<div id="domainofman">
   Our permitt of inquiry comes from a strenght whose origins I have but little explored. I can say, fairly, that it is but a process of time amidst the rest of things, and at that, marks how our inquiries have led to definite views. And ultimatley, there appears no reason why our minds are anything but a part of nature, as rocks; and that, peculiarly, their conduct is such, that their motions are responsaive like a tree is to light; or the mere neurology which causes an averse reaction from an animalas hand to a flame. All else is but a process of that arrangment, and the mecha of language which has led to modernity. But so is there not a mind, so to speak, any more than there is a heartbeat, or adrenaline.This, not seeming so special, are but the weavings of finer matter. And the point, is that if that finer matter is such, in a existent way, then so is everything else equally so; and our repute as to the complexion of our minds, and its enduring composition, fails via the mistaken stance on our mind; and at that, without such a stubborn appeal, the true nature of our suspicion of objects being equal to the existent pieces which form them, becomes clear. For our senses, are much higher then the basic pieces which, in their existence, be accordingly, but in ways that objects apprear to our senses. Namely, that they are seperate from one another, filled out [the error of opaqueness] and, foremost, that they are present, and at that continuous. But this indeed is a false remark, and primitive at that, of how things really are. And perhaps, as in most cases, development ins our liberal key; for none truly despire what things are, only their mysteries; and, at that, the conviction of what appears conlcusive: for it not being otherwise means a mystery which is so difficult to hold. "Let me know, give me wisdom, so my thinking and reproach may be done." For, in the continuity of nature,  so lies the incorporation of fallacy, and its eventural break. The reformation, for instance, is a example of this, and so much more similarly to come. And from this I see the complexion of real insight, that of our senses and their conceptions, that such impressions are fairly false, in the way that our behaviour has led to superstistion. But as such falsity is but a temporary state, as the truth in nature holds the finest rays, so does real insight occur, and progress accordingly. 
   <br>&emsp;And it is my view that our idea of entities are such, as not to remark what they are, but a higher order basis, via our senses. For instance, our sight is not so continous, as it is both, in the image, a compositition of granular inputs, and at that creates an equally granular image. And, effectively as this speckled view seems composite, or together, so are the impressions we get of all other things equally unreal. And, indeed, it is a mixture of science and its insights of the finer fabrics of nature -ie. the speckled truth in things- and our inquiry as to identify and describe the proportions and basis for such things, mixes together as to form an understanding of things, which is complete enough as to soothe our ultimate suspense, but not so absolute, as to be but temporily so, but in fact be vain, as our certainty was full of flaws and nievity. 
   <br>&emsp;And, indeed, here lies the harshest of things. For much imagery has been mistaken as truth, and our resolutions accordingly. But of what really matters, namely our own existence, so does the truth in that and the extent of knowledge required to be sure, is more than not simpler and prior to anything along absolute minds. "For indeed the neccessity of such an understanding being so, is in apprhensions which come from false identities and bare inquiries: and such is the reason why modernity is the coming hope: for the past, is not but a tense and stubborn storm: for nature need not be so migthily held, but rather submitted to." And to what, is her given hand: and to which end? one which is good, so long as your dance with her, is steady, pure and complete. And indeed, the marker then for what is true as pertains us, is when such qualities are present; for our steps must surely be best. And at that, so ought we merely dance, and measure ourselves by our disposal to that: and sin is indeed all that which causes a stiff hand, or a weight to toes.
   <br>&emsp;My point, is that the way nature is and how our impressions seem, is not aligned; and that of the latter, their holds no merrit; escpially when the remedying insight of science and precise inquiry show us that such  reality is in fact no as our sense seem. Of these accuracte insights, so ought they be learned to a full degree; for our aim then, is to question the basis for such things, while avoiding contrivance: for such proposals are like cushions to existence. Moreover, our mind is not a privilaged thing, but a limited lens by which nature is seen, and at that affords little sanctity. In fact, dealing with what is sacred can be done by offering the mere statement: of nature, in that she is whole and entire, so to that ought we invesitage reputably, and upon insight amend. Who is not doing this anyway. It only seems that such integrity to the truth brings contrary notions to what others believed otherwise. But remaining devout to such insights is quite stubborn, and admitts of no progress; which, in fact, marks a lack of care for the credibility of the basis for belief; as, those which once were held merrit only as much as their basis was credible: and surely a development from that basis affords an update of beliefs? Besides this stubborness, there is often an appeal to earlier reasoning; which in many ways says that the current proposals are wrong, as that which was suggested prior is more merritbale. Yet, this appeal is usually baked in loose impressions and concepts that run beyond the level of evidence; and at that appeal to the grandeur and brevity of miracles and revelation. What do these offer if not evidence? And if evidence is deemed unneccaaty, as the intervention of signs and offerings require no judgement but honor. Evidence is not treated so differently, for in that, so are we recieving signs, and submitting to them. The question then, as to the register in which certain signs are admitted as being clear for submission, is to the credibility of such signs, and whether they in fact are as they are attributed. Judgement and amends is one thing; by in terms of our assessment of the subjects for judgement, or facts namely, so is the perrenial split between supernatural and natural the real divide of our regards. For all things being of the latter really amount to a more complex and united picture. While the elements of the former seem somewhat true in a personal, if not local sense. For a man in China sees the natural complexion of the stars as a man does in Texas. Yet, a tribe in fiji sees the divine in different ways than those in Mumbai. Nor, in the supernatural case, so much as we are talking about particular signs within it, and at that ignoring the plausibility for intervention to begin, that of such superntural signs, that they must be amidst natural ones. If an auger spots a bird, and sees a pattern to his flight worth admitting, does he still not see the sun, the sky, the clouds; and is he still not privy to the natural scents and sounds around him. That is why they call it supernatural, because it is something amidst other things which are natural. It would not be so super otherwise. and the point, is that in this complex of super and fully natural signs, so is their a host of weakness and contrarity when it comes to those former. And of the latter, there is a eveness and vastness to all things invovled; moreover, do they loose nothing if those supernatural remarks are ignored. And, at that,  the basis for such supernaturl remarks, when verified, seem somewhat illusory and false: at least, their plausibility within existnece, so much as our natural extent implores, is unwelcomed, unable, and at that, unevident based on the abscence of any effects of that sort. "For nature has a mingling way, whereby her hues and flow mix together; and like light, bounce off eachother: and indeed, the likely cause of an intorduced strand or stroke, is such, as to be ceratin way and accordingly exhibit its effect on all the other common stripes: and there is no evidence of that." And, at any rate, it would seem that our reservation in accepting this natural state, and ignoring the falsities prescribed, is in so much as it feels important to us. Which indeed seems insincere when it comes to the nature of things: for your acceptence of that is almost strictly an appeal to preference, rather than truth. But, the real issue, as I see, lies in the roots of what has us averse to being unsure. And all the flawed attempts, at least as much as their findings were sacredly held, are such as to be like a child who has not learned his lesson, and is feeling the effects of his ineffectivness. The world has not changed, nor our place amongst it. But we were merely gunked up from the primitive stretch of our human flow. But modernity is coming, nearly. As Socrates died easily, like the Barbarians spilled threw, how the renaiisance could not be stopped, and enlightenment at that, so is our time leaving its primitive state. But the issue for man moving forward is not so much that he has now won: for indeed the delusion that he had prior, was almost souly in the fact that he felt he had, rather than the quality of his attempt. For the core speck of wisdom which always prevails, is surrender, submitt. For nature will then clearly be seen, and increasingly so, in its complexion, and your respectfull amends. I, saw not but air as a boy, and at that, anwsered only to what I was asked; and indeed, propiety and our limit glowed quite clearly: but so, our path lies, on  route filled with  cheer, to such agreed upon end.

<div id="graspfornorms">
   It seems that our reservations lie in the information age were part of, in that every person is at liberty to view a moutain of products and scenery, and at that, has a more or less personal view of things.
   <br>&emsp;Normally, the worry is that such variety of impressions will yeild to weakness and delusion. But our own idea of how they are so impressed is quite limited, and at that, worth reproaching from. All that seems to matter then, is formats of expression which remark upon this modern fact: and do so to an inflammatory and worrying degree, as they take the variety of impressions at face value, and think others so thinnly subject to them. A strong technique to overcome this apprhension, is in the mystery of other people who see that such people are making concerned expressions; and at that, from our point of view, do such people who see others worried, really impact them. In some sense, the core of our reproach is in the likely eveness by which the mountain of impressions come into folk, but ultiamtely holds no effect beyond that which integrates with the more significant and relevant stpes of their actual lives. And, equally, that of T.V and its edge of futility, so does such impression from others, be it in what they learn, or how they fear others are learning, so is such an intake as impactfull as it is relevant to their actual lives. For even my grandparents, who have contemporay convictions and attitudes regarding politics, more or less hold their tongue, less it comes up in discussion; and even then, it is indeed a discoure of frustration, in that the outcome and affiars of the subject are not either attended to or so whoelsomely concnerned, but how other people view things. But this indeed is a frantic characteristic, as the course of everyones days and lives are such that most of it is not bent by the information they recive: especially that which is potentially, or ultimtaley even, hollow. There is this venere on tevlesion which makes it seem more impressionable; and this is why theres not much of a fear of folk reading twitter, for its minutia is not seemingly overhwleming: and so much as it is, it is moreso of the drain on the user. Which is indeed the point, that of these things, our lives remain, and only that which is usefull is integrated. And those who become grogged down, or get spazic, are somewhat like ordinary folk with a sickness: and who ever made much of a difference with that?
   <br>&emsp;I would say, overall, that the breadht of the world is more or less flattened out by the noramility in things, and that akin to junk food, so is our choice in attnetion and effort the mitigating factor for our life's quality. And by that, all this abundacne of inofrmation is not much more than pollen floating in the air: and, as a compliment to the fruitfull grooves which feed our lives, abundantly. 
   <br>&emsp;From this, I can only say, that our curiosity and its effective complexion, is all that really concerns me; and indeed, a normal life is all anyone really seeks, and but of a colored or passioned kind as the wairs of the present reflect. But I only  mean then, that of such tears, that our life otherwise is quite ordinary, and, most importantly, subject to the baser laws which govern the good in our life. The impetus for knoweldge it seems is not so much in alleviating our personl worries, as an abandoment of tradition and non-inquiry does not leave one with any principal threat. Of our life though, in how it is good, so does the abandonment of others feel promeint, and at that, a heightened sense of their turmoil. I'd say, develomentally, that our attaintment of the good life has come from a seperation from other's common flow of things; and at that, we lack much insight to how others really are, to the effect that our own sympathies can rest, in a humble way. For everyone's life is the same, and be it a circumstantial moment of crimenad villany, or the mere degradation of living in less quality home or state, so are these, as much as we are a person amidst our own known brehteren, issues and cares beyond our heartfelt reach: and the pangs which seathe otherwise are more akin to inflammations of a cluttered mind.

<div id="thebestliving">
   The basis for health, in aim, is to procure the good life, its base at  least; while the actual mean of it, or conduct, is in all things, with respect to proportion, for consistency sake. Since we have an aim, the faciliation of it, so much as health is concerned, is a fairly explicity measure of how well, in terms of health in this case, it is doing to faciliate that. And in other words, the propiety of our efforts which, with respect to health, bring out the according basis for good living, is so, as much as the proportions which bring out such end, do so with regularity, simplicity and ease: and our own self regard, or personal assessment, is so, as much as our strict and or complimentary efforts (to health) are effective, or fruitfull at least, to the propoprtions which our aim (so much as helahtp procures it) requires. And, at that, of the constancy which our aim needs the complexion of our health to be, then so will our efforts which procure such mean, be judged equally of their merrits, so much as they produce the constancy of health and, accordingly, the good life which such development brings.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the good life is composed of many things. But, generally, the heart of it lies in action. For, indeed, whether we are aspiring to something, maintaing something, or enjoying something, so are we involved with action. And at any rate, it seems less relevant that our remarks as to what we have, bear any significance beyond the actual living which is done; and, generally, regarding things outside such possive remarks, seems much closer to the heart of the matter, being activity. As such, this life which we deem good is so, because it has good elements. But, the good that we have, is of our life, and at that the commplexion of such life; which, for consistency sake, is always moving, is subject to injury and oblige, and holds a neccessary limit at that. This is why indulgence and glory and futile goods, as their worth holds little weight in the actual course of our life, but in made up ones instead;  at least, if our composure is of an uneven sort, then we may be prone to passion, gratuity and over expression; but these indeed, with their according goods, remark an expereince whose strucutre is inflammed and weary, or overly tuned in awkward ways. Such is not our life and how, within our natural complexion, it is. By this token, the good we seek is from that genuine place of living. "while the good of someone who is encaged or enraged, is so as to remark an expereince born of an uneven life: while our goods are such as to reflect the fullest conmplexion of life."
   <br>&emsp;For whichever reason, this fairer view of living, is such as to be composed entirely of action, and at that, our goods come from procurring action of the greatest sort; in the sense that irritable action is with less favor than peacefull ones; and the funnest expereince is worth less as a moment, than a semester of wholesome study. 
   <br>&emsp;My feeling then, is that if such good life is found in actual living, or action so to speak, then the means by which we bring such living will be approrpiately such, that their output is of actions which truly are good, and not of a lesser sort. For we are always acting, in labor, peace, freedom and lust. But procurring the richest complex of these expereinces is such, that of their composition, so are they the richest when their arrangment is fit to the strucutre of life (in its fairest way); and accordingly, so our means are judged against. For, I need no motivation to look up and see the stars, to enjoy writing or the taste of sugar. Each of these though, come to us by different means; and although our expereince may be encumbant, and at that is limited merely by the scenario provided, so does our wisdom lay in what we actual provide. For our wish for food is innate, and a driving facotr for our search of food. But whereas the satiety of that is met when food is obtained, it is not too clear how the felicity of writing is acquired; and, at that, how it balances its requirment with proportions of other actions. For sugar is good indeed, as its taste brings us comfort and ease. But upon doing so, our mind is a little lazy, as is our heart and bones a little soft and unengaged. Writing surely doesn't come along from this; at least, as much as it does, so is the proportion of it less so, and of a fainter sort. This indeed is the inquiry of good living; for an abundance of one expereince restrticcts another, or it may be a compliment. And it is one thing to say what effects certain things have, and another to say what outcome is most desired. For the former comes through pure reflection, and deliberation at that upon the findings. While a mixture of simple reasoning, perrenial wisdom and basic truths (through inquiry), lay out the ground in which our nature stands, and by that, seeing who we are, and whereabouts, what composition would remark the greatest expereince: or compliments of actions which brought us the qualities reminsicent of such an expereince. And although one may be ingrained with relfection, like Montainge, or inbided with baser insights, like Plutarch and Epitetus. But there is none who can tell you, so frankly and adept, what marks the color and hue of the best expereince, the complexion and haze of truly good living. For these are indeed maxims, and given at that. But as for what they afford, so is it an operation to the mightiest degree. And the mark of a man, surely, is in being so indebted to the excellence born upon this, that their assumptions are held up by the virtue of inquiry, and its undemanding posture. Who could ever fault a man who thought that kindness and prudence were the mark of his entirety? What assumptions that this complexion bore from, was worth any scrutiny? The frontiers of this are perhaps unknown, and at warzone for those stuck in the sanctity of the paast, and the pedantry oeven of those so contempiraily learned, but unexpereinced with any kind of real living. "INquiry then is not a claim, but our deepest reflex away from the fires of our expereinced non-good living." And who can tell me the basis for all, in God or quanta: and at that, the truth in our actual reflex away from a flame: "for is that action not contained within all, and at that a mystery utlaimtely, so much as the basis for it is unknown? Yet our hand still moveth, and bears credible reference at that. To which I equally inquire regarding the heat and posterity of our everyday living."

<div id="hueandtambre">
   As in all things, defining the goal is ultimate, for all things are but a mean. And by that, our life is such, that of its best, so is it so as per the quality of our time, or experience. In that, we have both the strucutre of our life and its core truths, and the color so to speak, which we use, are are reminiscent of, in how such a figure is saturated. 
   <br>&emsp;This latter is the crucial strand, as the former is but a general construct of an undeniable sort, varying only in the degree to which you angle such a form -ie. our core nature and that of life. But so much as our complexion remarks, so is this best, in a flavorfull sense, when the tambre, so to speak, is not too firm, nor to soft, has a width which is encompassing, ample and broad, but not overly extended, nor too condensed and rigged. In a word, there ought be a richness which inebriates our heart and bones, and of that well placed and spaced sort. And at that, we would want this felicity as often as possible, and to the point where the bulk of the expereince was of the plumpest sort. Indeed rest will come, as will duty take our attnetions elsehwere: but so for this goal, in terms of a quality which best describes any good in our expereince, and one which becomes familiar to us in an innate and deeper way.
   <br>&emsp;As the core of our knot, so may be wind, and at that specify certain dynamics. For one, thinking of sex or literal sweetness, we have concentrated goods, in that their richness is in their density, not duration. This compares to the evening glow that one's mature sight can take hold of, and lastingly munch on; or, as a personal favorite, the very prominence of the moon, and our pleasure in seeing it accompany us through the day (as it goes through its own set and rise). 
   <br>&emsp;In a word, total, marks the strictess hue of our expereince, in that sex, for instance, is of the deepest reds, but holds relatively little volume; indeed it is more volumous than something like a donut, whose pleasure extends 5 minutes, but so is such an orgasm less extensive than a day at the beach for instance. The scale is there obvious. But so must we remark lingering effects, in both drowning and pleasing ways. For sex, albeit of a moment or so, or something akin to a t.v show, is quite composing through the rest of the time following; be it the feeling of accomplishment, or the pure physical ease, so is there a lingering radiance of satiety. Which is something tthat food expereinces reguarly, in that being full is a lingering compactness; and, at that, of a varying slate of solidity, in that a donut, for example, may leave a lingering dullness and indolence, while a salad seeps you comfortably into your composure, and holds you their with tender hold. 
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, anticipation is a sort of precusor, and a lingering approach at at that: as the hues of the forseen experience are but beginning to drip, but have not yet swashes over you. And indeed sex has this seeping potential, nor is the delight of a coming meal something uncommon. But, I ask you, how much value do we assign these lingering effects? For, comparably, is there more worth in a explicit moment of joy, which is both approached and followed by an eveness of  comfort, or a long duration of ebbing fortuity, whereby you rest with both brimmness and cheer, and, with frequency and grace, periodiclaly peak into moments of prominence and acuity, and expreince a sort of regular swiftness and fecundity? How do these genuinely reflect one another, and is the concentrated peak of one more desirable than volume of the other? It is hard to say admittedly, for the comparioson is very much in a vaccum. And, at least for me, the latter is indeed my preference, as the former instance is literally a momenatry slice of purity, no matter the lingering, while the latter layout is one of extended richness of a wholesome kind. 
   <br>&emsp;I would say that these qualities are but factors which we deem prinicipal, and at that the basis for our calibrarory regard. And, in being so, the complexity and v  ariation which most things are reminsicent of, holds some standard, if not basic strands which to act pecilalry from. As indeed, in the case of food, a great dinner may only be so for the tastiness it affords, but exhibit not but a luggard density to the pleasure and peace through the rest of the day. And when we compare this to a fresher meal, who is perhaps more timely and deliberate, that despite the more evened out remains of the day, that so is there the ineveitbale need for sleep and breach into the morning to come; and at that, beyond the actual impact to the period your in, so is the degrading of a subseuqent one genuinely dim. As beyond the perils of friction and its nagging effects on momentum, so are you literally achieving a flatter stretch of time beyond the one which followed the meal at hand. For we all sleep, and the hours before hold no irrelevance in how its impacted. And so, beyond the quality of your night, so is the root of the coming day connected, and at that a primary concern. For if we actually extend our thinking into the basic effects of momentum, so will the time leading up to the next days meal be impacted by the quality of your morning and afternoon. Just considering exerrvise and your other eating choices, how are those encouraged or pulled against by the grudgeries of the previous night: and at that, what angling effect do they have on next days dinner, where it is more open for you to further engage in begruderry, nor as smooth and effective in your prudent choice. 
   <br>&emsp;Indeed the complexion of things demands secondary principles, for the basisc of consistency and richness are not enough in their principal sense; especially when we bring in multiple factors whose judgment requires more than isolated assessment. All is brought together in our regard, as all things generally weave in with eachother. And the remarks we need are so as to ordain the greatest tapestry, and the fabric and stitching techniques which are essential in procurring so: and at that, hold the pivot point by which contraiety is judged by: for the means to our good, however limiting, are such as, insomuch as they are true, to neccessitate the exlusion of things which run in contrast to them: at least, in as much as the good which they procure is sought. For our efforts then are such as to only be according to our care to actually succeed: while our course to doing so is something entirely seperate, in that its formation comes from discriminate inquiry: and our interest in selecting this way, and amending to it in whichever outputing manner, is up to me.

   So empiricists acquaint themselves with the world, and derive inductions, or likelihoods, based on the expereince they have; while rationalists, work from first principles in order to derive what is neccessary, and by that deduce. Of the former, folks are fair to presume, or suppose rather, as much as their induction grants; but they are indeed stepping beyond certainty, and taking for gratned what may or may not happen by the likely nature which their reasoning is based on: but we can say, fairly, that as strong the induction is, so are they fair in their presumption. While rationalists, and those in realm of possibility, indeed have more certainty to their claims; but the actual soundness, or suitability to their claims, holds no guarentee prior to the judgement of their premise' grounds. For one may say that things are to be a certain way, and by that hold a certain conclusion; but who is to say what things are, and at that, how they are, as our expereince would rightfully show. And the point isn't so much that observation is the soul insight to the subjects which we base our principles on, only, that of such identities, so does their place as the effective basis for such principle reasoning, require some sort of clearence as to the soundness in which such subjects are used. For instance, one may say, that all things need a beginning; yet, of all things which are, so much as we call them events, so is the notion of beginning quite irrelevant, and in some cases innappropriate. 
   <br>&emsp;This is indeed a struggle of proportion, for the lack of one side brings much trouble to the other, in that, as much as each side supposes, so do they each rely on such bases. For, an absolute truth of things is needed for our observations to make sense, for things seem confusingly distinct yet together; yet, as we better identify them in such an investigaive way, we end up moudling them with proprties which the rationalists are concerned with, that being their origin, constiuency and such. And at that, the claims of the rationalists are so, as to be only strong as the elements which they use have any real basis; for their buisness truly is in whats possible, but as remarks what is, as if, of such possibility, is actual, so ought the reasoning for that align. And at that, so is our understanding of what is actual a limit to what we think the conduct of possibility is: for withtou the former, we cannot truly speak to the latter, in that, of what were saying, is what it is with respect to what and how it affords. And the evidence which correlates to that, as if proof to the reasoning, is somewhat representative of the strenght of such reasoning, in that it rightfully accounts for what it is proporting. 
   <br>&emsp;As in all things, the issue comes to identity; for in this lies the issue of origins, as a thing which has one will be, as a thing, invovled with such; and at that, include such aspect in our usage of them as a subject, and in some sense render the question mute. The Gurlbeshit as the German's say, 'why is this, this?'. And at any rate, the details of our inquiry may be, however complex, situated around this identity. And unfortunately, a procees appropriate to our place as inquiries, is required: for the place of such a technique is ultaitmely, and evidently seemingly, squeezed out over the time following our sure conclusions:  whereby the basic weakesses of our claims make leave for furthering questions as to enligthen a farther truth. This process is my approach, and at that stems from our view of inquiry. Which indeed, balances the favors and reality of principles and observation; but so to, of the complexions of each, do we, as the inquirer grow, and at that learn more about what we are trying to ask: to which we can give more promsing thoughts. And an anwser truly exists: at least I grant the proper belief in this. But our proces holds no place in being anything but militantly endless: for who, in their right mind, when the basis of things is sought after, rightly sees that, from our current spot, when, where, or if even, to any probale degree, the end of such inquiry?

<div id="mindandwit">
   So perception is a sort of stream of inputs, whereby the expression of things impart themselves upon you, yeilding percepts. Conception, is the identification of these things, in an intellectual sense: the yeild being a concept.
   <br>&emsp;Now, looking at the redness of a red apple, one may perceive this, in a flowing sense, but then define it more deliberately: at least the property of red. Similarly, we can draw a shape, such as a circle, and at that derive concepts from it. The shape itself, being more abstract than the apple, is indeed a multitue of points whose relations are, in most ways, presupposed, or upon learning them at least; and at that, the general 'circularness' of the shape is perceived -as it is shown- but so may we, akin to the various proofs surrounding the Pythagoream theorem, concieve further relations regarding the shape, and at understand more.
   <br>&emsp;When we come to the notion of God though, or a perfect being, or that of infinity, nothingness and other truly abstract notions, you can see how, albeit abstract, that the concepts of the circle are born through the perception of a more existent thing. Our belief in those former notions is one thing, but the actual perception of them is quite bare. And at that, our concenptions born from them seem built on the defintion we have of the object in question: and indeed such  an object, or thing of precept, is not so existence, or real in any fair sense.
   <br>&emsp;This, to me, is the problem of philosophy. For some, in their wiless wit, see the conception of those completely abstract objects as supreme; as if our intellect is forming ideas and (concepts) of the purest things. 
   <br>&emsp;I think this is false in many ways, or without much grounds in reality. But still, one may still personally conceive and expereince the purity at that. But I am not entirely sure this is whats going on. The diffiuclty of describing this process along the lines of basic laws, language and behaviour is tricky. But, I can say, that so much as we are clear on what, in reality, there is, then I believe that these 'pure conceptions' are nothing more than the physical processes of language and behaviour conceiving: and the latter notion is a mere detail of this process, but a surface level element at that. This presumes, or works from the basis that cognition is physical, indeed. But I can say, that beyond this murky notion, that the actual expereince by which we concieve, holds a continuity of increasing preference, or sweentess that is. The prior notion is that concieving the deepest of objects remarks the richest expereince; yet, concepts are mere marks of what we see, and our attempt to fully conceive them through identity. Pragmatic this may be, but I see the pondering of absolute objects as a sort of overly bent inquiry, whereupon the muddled knowledge that we have colors the potential clarity as something both afar, and perfect -as compared to the imperfection were privy to now. But this is not so virtuous by my account, at least as inquiry is invovled. For one, the grounds by which these absolute ponderings conduct themselves, is not truly special, in that they are, either A) different as inquiriers do to the material their inquiring to, and B) seperate from any other sort of inquiriers, with a mere difference in the variety of things one inquires to. But, regarding the nature of inquiry as part of our behaviour, and at that a misappropraite of it as something privy to, or an indicator for the pure objects they see.
   <br>&emsp;What I see otherwise, is that concepts are like marks, in that they hold more defined and deliberate detail; and from here, what you further see will contain those definitions. As if the sun browned the sky, and through inquiry you termed the gradient by which its further points differed than the flat horizon; and upon annother sunset, so may you see the gradient within it, and at that, your view of the sunset has changed. 
   <br>&emsp;The question then, is of such concept, that if it is of an addition to what you otherwise percieved, then what are we really initally privg to with respect to pure objects, and our then subsequent conceptulaization. Perhaps additions are not what their trying to make, and they do, in some way, merely wish to percieve. Yet, the obvious refuation of, 'well so are we conceiving then as to be aware of these objects; by virtue of their unexistence, so must we conceive them, as an origin to their mark upon us, or an addition at least as to give the purity more body and deifintion: as to be more amply seen -which some reflect as the greatest privilage, to see such purity.' 
   <br>&emsp;In these regards I am troubled to make the distinction of merriting any findings of such pure coneption, whereby we honor the actual plasure and joy of doing so, but recognize no genuine findings; that, compared to the real conceptions of things, and how we to our benefit and pleasure, further those. And indeed, much is to be said about the former, while the latter is a mark of privilage and character: the balance at least. "As wise men in poor times fair more than the richest of fools."

   Concepts feel strange. For on one side, you have notions such as, 'my income is such, and clearly, considering our literal income, we have this much leftover when we balance our outgoing spending'. This acts as a sort of breadth to our otherwise financial sensibiliity; which might, via past experience, act on the sense of our ability to spend, freely, or with restraint; but so in more natural and sensible ways. For instance, none really rely on concepts to know that they can't purchase a sports car: they almost intuitively know, and can see such a thing without defining it clearly, and measuring it agaisnt other knowledge. While a new shirt is equal, but flipped, in that we hardly go through the books to do so, and more merrily act as our sense permitts. "And in some ways, be it a mark of health of bit by bit spending, so do we buy a cup of coffee everyday, simply because it is what we do -and such habit comes from the meagerness of each incident, and how our admission to so without much thought creates a frequent prescence." 
   <br>&emsp;I do not do much mathematics, but I do play a fair bit of games; and although the meaning of concepts is not seemingly bent on such local matters, but I can only drill it down to our actions otherwise being of more immedaite and unsifted responses, while a more deliberate approach includes the detailing and use of concepts, as if to better see the eleemnts in question, address them not only via their clarity, but also in ways that are fuller themselves. This indeed is what I would ascribe the term 'mark', in that, of what we expereince, so do we learn and or describe things, as to see them better. And, generally, much of what we expereince is overlooked if not for its relevance to us, be it for pleasure or duty. And because such things seem important, we concieve further details as to further our subsequrent relation with such things. A stranger for instance who catches your interest, may remain so, and at that hold much awkwardness as you unfamilialry speak with them; but learning their name, and upon the next conversation, you address them as such, and thus engage with them according to this new view you have. Personally, this process translates into a positive expereince, whereby the eleemnts of the world which enter my liberated mind (via modernity and character) urge me to identify them more deeply, so that I may further see them later on, and remark upon them at that. "For man has grown up with most of his regards set on negative things, and the aversion to that. Food in contrast, is something that civil folk have been privialged over the recent millenias, and at that, conjured more ways to refer to and act upon such interests: as such details allow us to further invovle ourselves with such common and frequent elements."
   <br>&emsp;Something which comes to mind then are symbols, and the concretness which they reflect. For the basis of language is tough, and our according behaviour, but we can generally say that such things remark, in the ways they are active, things which are relevant and or existent to our lives. This is why we all know words for hot, sweet, danger, while few have any understanding of a circle's true proportions. And at that, I see that we can learn what such a shape is, and other things of a mathemtaical sort. But there is this threshold of reality, more or less, where the superficial notion of maximum and minium, extent and barrenness, perfection and the detail of being lie; and, in there, lies to an extent these mathematical principles. And alebit an exception I'd say to the more or less strict abstractness of those prior elements, so is this so, or permitted rather, in that, of real things, so do they exhibit the relations which, be it sourced from or presupposed, such abstracts have. Only, were talking numbers here, not figurative concepts. Those, at least, hold no evidence beyond their abstract conception. At that, numbers, configured in a certain way, will show relations to one another which can be described. 4 steps up, 3 steps left perpinduclar to that and at the base of the former, and the distance between the ends of each will be, if you took that many steps for each and added that many, that many times (squared), added the value together, then rooted the value; which is to say that, by whichever equation, you found the amount of steps, if taken and added to by that amount steps, that many times, to reach that prior value. Which indeed is 5. This relation, so much as the numbers which procure it noramally are in place, will reveal this form regularly. But is this real? I do not know in the abstract sense; for I give some permitt to see it so based on a humility to all things, but specifically to the resemblence which even its most abstract circusmtance finds in reality. But I think ultiamtley, that as such relations, or resemblences to the abstract, as found in reality, are the only real thing; and that it is more of a mistake of language and cognition to see our concepts of these of an intellectual sort as something beyond reality, and mental. This is indeed is the hazy division between abstract and real thinking, and the actions of the latter. And I would say, regarding mathematics, that their place as real things is more in line, to the extent that they are real, as they reflect but our recognition of something in the real world; and as one may say that, in terms of light, that something is bright, shaded, red, spotted, jagged etc., that so may one say that something is circular, in that it holds a uniform distance from some center point to its edge. These are indeed concepts, as an tree which has fallen slightly compared to one which has fallen greatly, does show a smaller angle in the latter, and at that our regards may develop identive notions of these; as are numbers and syllables a more conjurable way to speak about everything. But so are symbols such, in that they represent things; and that, as microbes are but earlier parts of the continuity which the heat of mammals is a point of, and the dexterity of a capuchin opening a nut, and the basics of man making suttle sounds and indications of things, increasingly, to our more complex language and the register of concepts which we have (as we can, and have developed tools, to represent more thing), so are we in truth more privy to things of that register, but so little modern as much as we 'make things' from those represnetations.
   <br>&emsp;And that is in some sense the difference. From the base of it,  concepts are details which we use to identify things, or at least broaden our ability to do so. "as their may be little which our lack of a concept would have ever slightly shown; but, as if we had learned elsewhere, we may see some descriptive term, that upon embracing, would let us see things with respect to that." And, besides this representationl model, where true langauge and behaviour lie, so are their concepts which concieve of things not so existent, or representationl beyond the illusions of our experience. Which, indeed, is a fair source of such high conceptiosn, as dreams, imagery, the looseness of imagery, and all the mistaken testimonies and experince that foolishly impress us with something to be subject of our conception, may in fact be the source for us detailing such subjects with further concepts; but, from a soucre which is not wholly founded. "Its as if someone told you they say bigfoot, and based on your real notion of gorillas, you applied your regards of those to this knowledge of bigfoot (as the person shared). But then, seeing as you don't know enough besides the basis form and the details you've added, you come up with new notions which can be added to that, as was likely done with the early impressions of gorillas. As for instance, the fact that they were fury was something not so unobvious, but the distnction between gorrilas with respect to their furyness, gave merrit to defining a term for the kind of furyiness. And so to this baser form, and the details we already had, do wo concieve of new ones, as if to give it a name, a history and reason for its being." The strange thing, is that this process is hardly singular in its soucre, as one person tells a story there and we concieve it as we can, and another person does the same, and so forth we conceive. These two subjects though become a source for eachothers conception, as the insight of one, derives sentiments which are applied to the latter; and over time, as the body of these subjects grows into the thousands, and the fruitfullness from each extends to those around, so does a innerwoven fabric of whats real and the according conceptions come to be. But, these are all based on those earlier stories, whose missapprhensions magnify over time. Moreover, the diffiuclty of representing things around this developed body of knowledge, beomces somewhat judged on the way it fits within such body. "Ding Ding Gallileo."
   <br>&emsp;<br>&emsp;Out of the Past
   <br>&emsp;I say, quite comfortably, that modernity is coming, and that, merrily, it assumes only a fair and common grasp on the details of things. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the mystery which we pre-modernly presumed, is not there; and at that, our overly bent and brooding conduct to learn the truth in all, is not so warranted or of need. And, in fact, though this is only for beliefs, is whether such truth, so forcefully, and at that erroneously, conceived, is actually a matter which can be so, and at that is, in being true, so; and at that, our we every so privy this in ability, and neccessity at that. 
   <br>&emsp;The theory of truth is one thing. But I care little for a forced conception of what it is, or ought to be, on empty basis'. Motivation isnt a reason for disregard, but, in our inquiry otherwise to how things are, so do I respect the motivations which others are encouraged by as to see such truth; as they do it so forecfully, and at that contrive much of its structure, and at that neglect the reality which we are privy to in the simplest of ways. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, our conceptual framework is more of a response, and at that a binding of such responses, as to more abily speak in generality. But the buisness of man is not in erecting these bindings to some plausible peak, or dreamt one. Again, belief is one thing, and aspiration holds no quarrel. But pretending like this is relatable to the world at hand is a mistake, and in increasing ways, holds less resemblence to it -as we understood the real world. 
   <br>&emsp;What I can say, fully, is that the need for this belief, or hunch, to be met, is in the depths of inquiry, and its awkward shortcomings; in that, of reality, or pure conception, we struggle to fully, or, respectively, fairly say, what basis for our concepts are: and at that, what the truth should be, and thus our course to it. For the bounds of this depiction are such, that the world has become somewhat substantial, while the conceptual world has been pushed out, or squeezed rather to its most abstract edge. Case in point, gravity, thermodynamics, wave theory and quark dynamics have filled out the conceptual holes which even our early modern theories speculated upon -or thought their abstract ideas as being fit for that, as a limit perhaps of what we could know otherwise. And of this portrayal, I can say, as a man, that the outline of this all appears in contridictroy ways to the foliage of ideas and expereince which have grown from ancient times to this nearly modern day. And at that, the mystery which such roots were levelled upon, is no longer an issue; at least, the genuine concern being our death, holds not but a natural pleasure, in the rest it in reality brings. I am not afraid or in any ways averse to lettting reality squeeze out the contemporay schematics of old, and let our modern expereince settle in as a true model of natural respect, and at that our place as a member subject to its ways. For in that, the truth I see is defintiively preferable, and at that worth respecting more than those who work to scheme away from this seemingly natural truth, but are to nieve to see its benefits: and in some sense, beyond their repsectble attempt, insincere in their wish for some other end than the readily apparent truth. The annals of progress are such, that the map of progress is blended, in that those who, by todays accounts seem foolish, were in fact pioneers; but their relative progress does not warrant the fruits of their labors being seen as true an eternity later. As the person who invented the wheel was indeed the einstein of locomotion; but ought combuistion, and the cars using it, respect anything more than the current state of progress which that ingenuity springed? Or should we honor its findings based on the time, as if there was some deeper truth that the relative granduer of the success revealed. 
   <br>&emsp;I don't know, and in fact I am simply rambling, and have no actual point to say.

<div id="chainofpropriety">
   My life is not lacking in liberty. And not souly due to our modern privalage, but character too. None of the folk who my sensibilities are in thanks to, lived in any time which was not comparaatively unprivaleged, yet still flourished due to their virtue and self regard. And, however well off they were in their respective times, so are we, in our worst, still on par -so much as we are poor within modernity that is. And, as regards the ebbs of life which strike at us all, so is class and fortune a mere garnish to that, and besides the point then.
   <br>&emsp;What I can say despite all this, is that our occupation is awry, if only due to our frugality in treating the point of it -and then living as though we were free.
   <br>&emsp;Morals on the other hand are a sort of confusion, and at that, bear their pressing head so much as our idea of occupation is out of line with those around me, and the culture at large. 
   <br>&emsp;For it is hard to tell someone that your needs and wishes are simple, and that our liberal steps are warranted by virtue of our sufficient success. There is a complex development, generally through the whole of society, and specifically, through your particular lineage, which brings you to see the world a certain way; and, at that, how those around you and most impactfull have views similarly. I don't lack this reason, as the worth of things has always been clear; and, so much as we were't involed with the common goods around, that our intensity in being so avert was partially do to the fake elements which were evident reasons for such norms. And the reason that such fakeness seemed clear is in part due to our dad, who is not a fake person. And so, besides the history of our choices, and our predilections which drove us, I can say that such outputs, as our current moment, is in fact a detail of that continuity. We can trust at least that there is a reason for our choices by that sentiment, and the specifics are but a detailing of such account.
   <br>&emsp;For I am in a place where all which makes me happy, is not so unclear or hard to attempt. Only, the ability to do so is not yet integrated within the norms which would make us otherwise happy; and at that, our reserved approach to living rightly, comes at the expense of those thing which make us happy, or call out to us at least. In many ways, this has caused a distortion of things, as our wish to be amidst the norms of people, but in a truer way, has me seeing our truth as a sort of leverage point (by virtue of its novelty) which is best aimed at acquiring a place in those norms. The ways of our true self are all we have, and thus the soul pick for anything we'd do, and, our time in such place, however procurred, is more clearly kept for you to be in such a true way, if the procurement and maintence of such place is through such truth.
   <br>&emsp;But all this is a remark of us being unhappy, or outside the common goods. Which is fine normally, as most men of the past have known. Only, when we are not so good in our truer way, so do those common goods seem more appealling and absent, which itself ties back into our motivation to reach said goods through the truth we have, and at that, begs us to return to a state of goodness, as if the motivation to do so (by virtue of its procurment of those common goods) was more desired.

<div id="giftofkin">
   So, it is standard, as much as the scenario is expected, that for my children we wish well. But what this means is quite different depending on your concerns for them. And at any rate, rather than divulge what you'd want, we may simply speak to the two distinct approaches which one may take to preparing for and managing their childs life.
   <br>&emsp;One, is to do with fortune, such as a home, a nest egg etc., while the other is of proficiency, or the promience of one's ability to be sufficeint in their life. This latter is such, as to call on all people to meet their needs through effort and duty, with proficiency being an extension of that. For one may be a minimum wage worker, and feed themselves doing that; or they may be a plumber, or harness some other form of craft, to earn more -and through a more elegant and flavorfull occupation at that. This compares with fortune, in that its goal is to provide freedom from effort; as one's interest in investing into a home, or a fund, is so that it becomes an asset which pays you later on. 
   <br>&emsp;But in regards to our cares for a child, it equates to what I, in my highest dreams would seek. And that this would simply be the best of living: which our time is the soul factor, and limited by our employment of it: and this holds little cares for all but sufficient funds. And at that, if we simply say that our aim is to spend our time well, then we see, that despite the freeom fortunes afford, that their accumulation and preservation is done so through much ardor and committment. Consequently, two drawbacks occur, namely the allocation of our time during the investing period, in both the dedication to contributing (to your investment) and, in the case of a home, the riggidness that such an asset brings; and secondly, upon the actual taste of the invesment all that time later on, that of the actual benefit it offered, in the open lane for good living, that such goodness within living, in terms of one's aptitude and their interest, had not yet been cultivated. And indeed, being ignorant of this is an error along all paths; but, in the case of nurturing our fortune, so do its committments keep our culvitaion within the actual needs and love of living at a compramised level.
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, our care for our children is present so much as we have a sight on such a situation; and I would say, with an even head and tempered heart, that our interest in reaching such a scenario is complimentary, if not, at its core, entirely derired from our more evident pleasures of friends and family, people in general. And at that we can say, as a preface, that the wish for chidlren, or sight of them forthcoming, is likely due to its natural extension of our already human interest. There is no genuine need for it, but our hearts tend to want otherwise; and, with some relfection, it is fair to consider the composure of our selves and mind, and how any uneveness there may bend our interests to something besides children; or, as it is sometimes known (or depicted), that such idea of children, coming into us by the lens of our true selves, may be overly glarring and undesirable. But that is for such person to decide: while we note their reasons otherwise.

<div id="seaofexpression">
   I'd say that what we mean by intelligence, is the ability to point to things, mark them, bear regard, and advance this by detailing beyond the mere subjects in question, but their properties, relations etc.
   <br>&emsp;At that, akin to agriculture permitting new occupation, that so is langugae facilaited by freer circustances, where more is seen and attended to. This indeed is something which takes ages, while the former takes but a segment (ie. antiquity).
   <br>&emsp;Relevant to this is broader means of communciation, such as books, letters and, as of recent, radio. This seem to offer two kinds of interaction, namely converse, be it social or administravitelvy, or that of engagement, such as a novel, a song, a play. 
   <br>&emsp;When the breadth of communciation expanded, namely in letters, accounts, and the propogation of information via books, so did the world expand for the better. But there was no such thing as a film, or the radio, or a webpage. The content was there, but in analog form, as you would have to perform the music, or be there to here it perfomed; and euqally for a play or a speech. Whereas now, these are all packaged effectively into letters, whereby you can recieve the expereince on your own terf. 
   <br>&emsp;Similar to special goods in the past that became mass produced and accordingly accessibly, that now we are inundated with a mix of elected and or expressed products. And to be quite frank, I find none of it that compelling. Or, at least, compared to the true goods one has, and those of a consumer sort, so do I see the roots of converse and culture as something seperate, in value at least, or nourishment, when it comes to that which is so pieced out and conveyed. And our choices seem somewhat consurmable when we look for these things, and otherwise subject to when billboards are there while passing by.
   <br>&emsp;A reassuring thought is that most of this is not to do with authority, as that is till settled by letters and true reference. These other matters seem like a leisurely sort, or an enthusiast sort. 
   <br>&emsp;The trouble though, is that people do learn from this outputs. And the concern of someone like me is in whether or not their impressionss lead them to jump to conclusions. Parts of the world seem so dissolute, as the culture which comes from these modern communcations amount to a fair, where the content is swirled around in areas that are created with respect to such content; while the normal lanes and swaths of the world remain mroe or less common with respect to how they are derived from what is accordingly communicable. 
   <br>&emsp;I'd remind you that the creation of a country is quite a moment, and in the case of the US, done through a seperation from the motherland. This is not relevant to us now; and a new constitution seems wtihtou means or motive. Then, concerning the amanicpation act, that the pains to get this through, in a legalsative sense, is such that even of an issue so deep and prevalanent, that a war had to be fought over it. In our current case, it seems more like Hollywood and message platforms are responding to apprehensions of folk, centered around bullying and representation. But these outlets are not a country, as we hold no onlige to them, nor they any authority over us. And it is indeed looking at things from their side of things out, to say that those invovled are influential in the public realm, and thus worth our concern as much as such an enviroment is conducted. Only, such an environment is like an arena, or hunting grounds within the broader empire. And the empire is not subject to it, but the other way around. Google does not marshal its policies with any force of law; but, as a public institutuoin, its conduct is obliged under the laws of the country it is housed by; in the same way that the judicial system is the carrier for an inccurence within a resteraunt: the latter is but a veseel for the judicious heart it is housed upon. And even then, if Google could penalize folk, it would be within the platform, of which we are with no oblige to take part in; or it would go through the due process of the public courts, and at that deal with the perpetrator as they are with respect to such realm, of which google is equally a member. 
   <br>&emsp;A very narrow minded view still needs depth, or lenght at least. For the effect of online discourse is such, as one can only say, the outcome of a presidency; which is itself a primary node in the nation's fabric. But the stitching of it stays, and at that remains aloft and cloth like. The proporations of modern communcations effects are in need of stating, but the actual concern which they may cause is not much more than a change of captain. The boat remains, as does the proper conduct of navigation. And at that, most who man such a position are some sort of captain. Our discourse though is stuck on the far side of things though. For I mean only to describe the situation, or times. And indeed, the hardest thing to do, is to say that people's invovlemtn with a dissolute source, and their concerns accordingly, are without cause. We are best otherwise to explain the world, from principle and evidence, and more rightly see the subject of consumer media. Effective communcations marshal the processes of the world; and, indeed, are not to be blamed as accomplaices with respect to their use in poor scenarios. That is a culutral issue, not the furnishings. But the consumption of indirec sources, be a preacher, a play, a film, or the radio, are simply dropped upon us, be it elected by taste, or through the complexion of the source. 
   <br>&emsp;It is so important to note that this carnival of consumer media is entered and exited to and from the world. Its lands and granduer are in the smallest ways described by miles and decades; and in its largest, countries and centuries. Your impressions from film, radio, tv, magazines and prompters is like converse at a dinner table. It is brought upon you like a resterautn serves: and they have no say or impact on the nature of or standard of food. There is merely a propietor, and of the property which you engage on. And the consumerates of media are akin to woodstock or a wild band of hippies living in Arizone, in that they create their own grounds. But I live on the grounds of the West, and that of the world and time. And the goods I see are the ones native to those.

   So, comparing Star Trek and New trek, the common distinction is one of virtue. Each presents something, and indeed the entertainment is determined by how they present it. But as an old tale of a sort is not comaprable to a modern drama, so is the message in the former still accessible, and meaningdull at that. 
   <br>&emsp;In this wsy, Star Trek is about a future where intelligence, dignity, and humanity are revered and employed. While New Trek, is like modern TV: very grim in its views, full of criticism and contempt. And in this, all the people depicted are vicious and selfish, irepputable. And acroos the board it seems, rather than a particular individual. 
   <br>&emsp;To me, this is a very young adult theme, where the dystopian view of the future comes from a negative outlook on things; not a pessimistic, as the one to some extent is by their bases regard for our suns collapse; but a negatvie one, where peoplre are shown to be irreputable and of vice. A sort of misanhtropy if you will.
   <br>&emsp;Star Trek seems more for adults, as, per you state of being one, so are you subject to the world and its domain. And perhaps the most basic rule, as you'd share with chidlren, is that it is not the worlds fault that you error, but your own. By that, we color this notion with responsability, as no one else is going to do it for you. And what it seems, is that, per the YA novels of the recent decade, or the stark contrast to raunchy comedies in the grimmness to drama, is this unacquainted point of view from the real world, but that of youth, or adolescence. In one, there is a peak confidence, as the sheltered location is overcome, and one becomes a sort of ace teenager. There is not much negativity here. But as one becomes dutied withi nthe world, so is there ability spent tasks, as their needs motivate. And at that, so much as this dynamic is not overcome, as most adults eventually do, so is one adoslcscent; in that they are actionable in the right ways, but burdened by it somewhat, or enclosed. While a confident teenager is merely thriving in a small safe world, so is a young one who is not, merely without confidence, by their age we'll say; while someone who is odler, and at least has become acquaited with the needs of the world, so is their employment there on which is outside of that safe world, but equally unthriving -(or overcome). And the confident teen is one who merely goes from there small completness into a large incompletion; while the shy and nervous teen is merely brought into the world, and incoplete in equal ways.
   <br>&emsp;And I believe there is this negativity and unadmirable perecption of the world from these sort of people. Subject matter is one thing, but an older, grown up view, would not hold such contemptable views: as if the world were wrong. No one, as I have read, and expereinced, who has virtue, finds much vice in the world, except that of negligence of cultivation. For our steadyness sees nothing wrong with the world; in fact there are many blessings, but a failure to meet them; with a consquent proness to falling, and missing out on the goods available. Theres just not this attitude from those who are not endowed with virtue, or flourishing. "As rich folk complain less, but hold no less complaints regarding their likely losses (by their possession) as much as their character is absent as those who are poor."
   <br>&emsp;In many ways, our view of the world is one thing, and others their own. But it is this awry feeling that each is different. And by my accounts, the tension comes from a lack of description in how others feel. For if we did, we'd see that their apprehnesion was more of a personl struggle, rather than a social consequence. And, that as much as it was, so was it pitched opposiute of the core civil matters. "For in this world, the world burns, or judges are appealled to."

<div id="openedup">
   A discriminate life, on the whole, is a natural one, as per our species, we learn and inquire, and at that fail to ever reach a threshold where our enlightnemnet is finished. 
   <br>&emsp;Across broad periods of time, there may be a general sentiment of fullness; but so does something new which catches one's eye, lead to further discovery and definition.
   <br>&emsp;I would say, currently, that there is a fairly concentrated transition in our culture, both in a recent sense regarding the current and past century; but also that of a macro sense, where we are on route to nearly being modern; which in many ways, is akin to being civilized, but of a completed kind.
   <br>&emsp;Because of this, there is a lack of certainty; if only because our pleasure and content through communication is befuddled, and thus there is a good amount of apprhension. Clarity though is reflected upon, at least a lack of one draws the other. And by doing this, we describe things, patch things up; which is indeed the vector of any sort of progress.
   <br>&emsp;On one hand, you have the broader elements of our time, which one may more feesibly ponder and sharpen; but all through an inquisitive lens, or positive one rather. But then there are those elements of old, or at least ones which are in the same way dragging. This is the antinquity of the time, the glossiness, the dissproportion; and at that, the struggle to communciate this, and not feel seperate otherwise, or in turn accept the norms at hand.
   <br>&emsp;And what I'd say, is that because we are in a curious state, that so do things which, in a more clarified time, would pass us by, call on us to question them. The reason is not for curiosities sake, as if all is promising; but rather, our basis is undirected and set, and as new information comes in, we make sure to not let false concepts in. And, as I confess, the poorness of certain impressions has me alert to their arrival; as if our sensitivty to things by being curious, also has us in a less accepting state of those things seemingly dissproprition: all due to our discretionate state.
   <br>&emsp;By that, I see negativity which comes from a lack of description of the world, for there is not enough for you to settle on, and let falsity wobble along. And indeed, the extent of our need to clarify the world comes from our solitude; which can only be explained by our personal discretion, and the ways it holds accordingly -in interest, reservation, or mere affibility.
</div>
<div id="wildsofbeing">
   The roots of our apprehension are accessible, and by that deemed real. But our current trouble with such an affliction can only be described as 'revealing'. As the wears around you which rub up against said ways, only offer an insight into how that line of development has faultered: as our view of other things appears unchecked, as our more primary concenrs, upon their abscence, draw in shortcomings of other attentions.
   <br>&emsp;But, as I sit here, remisnicing as to why were so astray, I realize that the friction within this is to do with our pursuit of having such cares; and at that, a past which is respectable for its current process, and a future which is promising via what said line will bring, and at that our calrified amends and peacefull foresight as a conseuqnece of being so devout to such line (and its evident offer). 
   <br>&emsp;And what I feel, is that others around, be it our mother or dad, a friend, or colleuges even, the world as a whole, these are but surroundings which our approach to things melds with, or does not. And I see, that what I seek, is the freedom to pursue at our pleasure. And the inability to do so, or friction rather, is from disharmony with those sources.
   <br>&emsp;For me, the wonder of curiosity is always present; and conclusions which are, as it were, final, seem more bullheaded and constrained: for who could not further ask or inquire. And at that, as I breathe, and upon airs abscence grasp, so do I see things around, and accordingly respond. And positively so as my senses are not occupied with neccessary matters, but things which catch our wandering sight. 
   <br>&emsp;And indeed, there is this hue of reservation and apprhension; and an according appeal to proportion. But, this is best set in our suitable clarities, rather than clearing oppression. For the certainty and muddlesness of the world is but a lingering force, which penetrates our less than vital mind. And in that, pierces us, holds us, digs itself in; whereby our ingenuity becomes therefore placed, as if to defeat this confining enemy.
   <br>&emsp;And thereby, I accordingly seek; which is not to defeat that which drags at my mind, but to ultimately remain skeptical, forward, limbre.
</div>
<div id="boltedclaim">
   I see our development as a polishing key. For all apprehensions and mistaken views come from a detour from the natural alignment which such proccess' amounted to.
   <br>&emsp;By that, I can say, that all which is amuck, is so, because it seems different then what were used to; meaning that during our successfull points of development, we expereinced the proper form of life; and at that situated ourselves in a dispositional sense, whereby things which were contrary seemed ill founded, if only because there basis was born from a conduct than that which we already found true.
   <br>&emsp;But these maligned expereinces leave holes, or knots at least; and, as much as we are acting well, so is the levity of such experience, and initation at that, weighed down, or rather tugged against. Indeed this is but a friction, but so are there loose threads which become so, as the rising side from our success, has stiffer points which fail to equally extend. In a way, passion results, as what you see ahead, or imagine at least, as the place where that restrcited point would reach, is so as to be as it were, foreseen, while you were dragged behind. 
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, this uneven levity leaves scarrs in our otherwise fine expereince; and at that creates splotches and reserve. This does not remove the worth of the lines which are properly drawn; but indeed, it is as if one part of you is expereincing pleasure, while another less so. As I have found, the sum of this brings with it a sort of acceptence of any shortcoming, as the less there are, the easier it is for any impurites to be looked past. Yet, being somewhere in the middle, whereby your shine is but a mere average, and albeit up and glowing, is still too dull to counterbalance the dragging weight below. Or in other words, because you are somewhat forward, the drag from below becomes all to apparent. If you were otherwise flat, then you may not notice, and then divulge into a sort of empty depression, or gluttony.
   <br>&emsp;But the expereince of drag is an interesting one. For, in the case of defense, so are our senses alerted for preservation; and at that, our responses to things are to diminish, by vifrtue of the nnegative suggestion. While postivie ones (of suggestion that is), curry your further interest, and at that invite you to offer a generous amount -with no wished for, or clear even, cease. But in that, lies the contratiety of being both drawn and generous. For, disposition in some sense, colors our interests, as one does when their affection for someone becomes more than present, but ingrained; yet, in a future moment, they may be unable to treat them as their heart desires. 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, I lack no dispostion when it comes to provisions, the fair means of such developments, our interests, nor their fullest embrace. Yet, this latter troubles itself with our core errors, wherein we muddy the deepest threads. And, more or less, our sight of things becomes equally stained; and despite remaining in convictin, so does our direction feel flat, as if our cares are idle. 
   <br>&emsp;But so ought a man learn what it means to be so. For not only does his wish to proceed unintruded demand the dearest claim, in that it was not desirous or reserved, but that the nature of things which his success grants such freedoms is properly accounted for; which we might say invovles a fair assessment of nature, and the suitable conduct. For in many ways, an unveness to this basic regard, will make choices which are relevant to our excess prone to impurity. 
   <br>&emsp;Yet, in these remarks I see a struggle. For sobriety seems the requisite for liberty, as not doing so blackens her sight. But prioiritizing such, while clarity fondly sees, is not so easy when the wears of the world are amuck: at least the dynamics of that, of which we, as people, are privy to in social ways, becomes as such relevant. As, primairly, the association of people becomes troublesome when sobriety is sought for anything but divine [absolute] reasons; nor, is our own infamy and civil struggle a practical or admittable state of content, whereby our focus on sobriety can be amply treated.
</div>
<div id="tobetterbe">
   I indeed wish to see the real dynamics of the world, its ebbs at least. But, the friction around actually seeing problems, comes from the dissproprtionate views of others. I would like to see that taxes were changed to an extnet, or some regulation removed; but when the environment is so angsty about this, and poses as if these changes are some indubitable threat, then I lean on ignornance. 
   <br>&emsp;Which indeed is a source of seperation from the rest of the world; as our impact from any of lifes changes are ours to deal with essentially. Yet, the notion that others lives change to, is a little discomforting, when the squabbling of elders and pundants makes me cower away from the broader world. Perhaps I know to little not to be overcome by their regards, and find no interest in critiquing their basis. Nor do I find much warrant in it, for the fair effects of the things actually changed, don't leave much stress on how others deal with it. The real issue is people's distress at there being a change at all; like it represents something, and forboding at that; yet, the actuall adjustment is but a minnor degree, and more or less genial to all, no matter if its preferable.
   <br>&emsp;And I am generally convinced, on my own end, that these squabblings bring apprhension because of our aim in life, which is to live it well and truly. The greatest source of this care, is the discretion of life being varied in its ways; and at that, how all things produce slight if not whole effects to such ends. And from this, comes what Plato dealt with, namely a discouragment of leisure, purrid comforts and gratuity. And at that, comes a sort of educated apprehension, and the sight of so many people living in apparently vicious ways. To which the world seems consquently doomed.
   <br>&emsp;But I am not so convinced people do in fact live in such ways, at least with a complex whose proprotions are negativie to themselves, and to others -as you'd exepct at least. And of our view, it really comes down to us as a viewer. For as passion clenches are interests for the time ahead, so does our reservation to others become stiffened by our equal impurity. And, in this sense, our cares for true living, is such as to congregate (in our actions) with respect to meeting what is positive, and avoiding what is negative. And from my expereince, the states which are unfaciliative to whats positive, bring with it an exposure to negative attitudes and states; whereby the words and actions of others appear hostile, forboding, ill discretionate and farced. In many ways, our aversion to this is two sided coin, in that our positivity feels encouraged to remain so, while being stuck with such scrutinous regards, strickens me away, from myself to some extent; which does not in itself faciliate positivity, but a rigid escape from negativity. But this is akin to a childs response to their parent's abrasive behaviour, whereby they, in there ability to be active, deny such teachings, scold it, and hate the sender. 
   <br>&emsp;In many ways life is such, that our growth and development comes from mere honesty; and although the aim of things, in their clearest state, seems wortwhile and simple to make, that so are we amidst natural and or social misfortunes. For indeed, our place in life is but a part in the stream of things, and as if a product of the times, so has modernity, or liberty and curisoity rather, brought much felicity to such flow. "As if our strides are more accurate to natures current, and at that more able to keep up, fully, boldly, and richly." But so does this point of development in our lives require some form of recognition, of which the baser tenants of nature must be addressed, and that of our common lives. For the tendering of our heart and soul, albeit softenig of nature's basic fairs, and fruitfull to her brightess sides, does not remove any aspects of nature. Meaning that, of others bone headedness and or complaints, to your felicitious deeds, or means rather, and the primary end, of which the path equates, so do these remain.
   <br>&emsp;And the object of modern man is to merely describe this, so he may better be. "Know thyself, for the world will be equal in its ways, by which a centered spot of concern will be met, and true success fashioned. And through the breadth which our industry provides, so will our dormant faculties breath life into the offered extent: to which you fully meet the lane of nature, and earn her entirely." And, to otherwise say, that such is the gift for taking her hand; of which, your place as the wanderer, and the heed which your apprehension is towards, in total, marks the form which requires conception, for you then truly know the whole, and are pushed to the limits of its edge, whereby you blossom as a member of such whole, a man. As a flower is not the world, but fills out as it falls in line. And so will our inquiry and interest compare, to which liberty is our seat: and the base of proportion regarding our success, and confidence to where (and what is and is not contrary) lies forth.
</div>
<div id="nowfree">
   So, are we waiting to live? In some sense yes, as our cares of provision are but dangling there till a more suitable scenario arises. 
   <br>&emsp;This seems fine, but moreose seems an issue. For what are you doing now, if not literally living? Well, the truth lies in what we actually seek, which is not so much of our occupation, but our life. Indeed there are things which I see ahead but am not working towards now. But the flow of our life is such, that those objects are not the entirety of me; but mere regards for selection, like a task or addition to your life. I am simply not making the task of doing it now.
   <br>&emsp;Our life holds apprehension though. Nor is our timely understanding an anwser, as if alignment is what we seek, and souly care for. No. This amounts to congruency, but not living. For you see, living, is done with an open mind, a steady eye. And as drunkenss removes this, and sobriety is its contrast, so is your ovearll fitting to life a remark of your state; and by that, woven so based on your understanding, or clarity rather, of the world (including you). And from that, it is more like a continous point on a wave, with a peak which is flat, and a base which is gloopy. Our arrangment is best when were solid, taught, clear and tender. And from this, as if a mark of your vision and its sharpness, you see, mightily, on the path your own. Which indeed marks the care for constancy, as your ability to fully see yeilds results according to your progression; which is a conceptual notion, or matter of marks, as upon one bit of sight, so is the subject then further seen, if only because what your seeing is better knonw, and familiar; and from there, more about it, 'it' being now expanded, can grow: which is a continuing process. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps our movements are such as to be ill defined, in terms of our constant state within clear vision, or a rich pace through the lane of living. I can't say, for there seems a need of purpose, or understanding with mentioned paramaters. I think, maybe, that as much as these regards are to do with our humanity, and not so much knowledge, in a whole sense, that our basis for action and concern would source itself from our humanity; and at that, discern and in effect shape the observer, by our human expereince, and what it means for me, and who I am thus, through that integral constance.
   <br>&emsp;In some way, knowledge is entire, as it is bound to what we can no further contend:  namely that which is entire. But I would say, that the scheme for inauguration to a firm and tender pace of living, is so as to perhaps be but bolder, in amplitude maybe, for the purposes of that knowledge; while, holding the form, but scaled appropraitely, so does our humanity lay. And perhaps the greatest philospohy of all, is in holding such timeless insight in order to be so small, but thereby reach further. "Man ought to be bold enough to be himself, and not get sucked into reaching ahead; whereby the ends become cemented, despite life moving on: a strain for one still in fact living."
</div>
<div id="rungsofprogeny">
   Right and wrong seem an awkward thing; for the basis of things can never be sure enough, as to offer a platform for such truths to sprout from.
   <br>&emsp;Yet, as a man, of humanity, and a member in associtation, I see how we are in the ways relevant to our portion of that basis; at least the part of it which has sprouted into our neck of the woods. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, I can speak only to what is sufficient, and what proficeincy would treat. But, as remarks the truth in the matter, so is it our concern to harmonize our mind with that of reality, as to be fully part of it, and flow. This is truly the concern of our lives. And by the tenants of language and behaviour, and the mere attempt to solve a riddle or problem, so are these elements of sufficeincy but more complex issues; and at that, pitched on the basis of thngs, or truths which our sufficinecy can apply from. As the former remarks a principle, of man at least; while the latter, garners a structure which such prniciples can enliven. And per our discourse, so does the layout of this all require a sensibility to one, and an understanding of the latter.
   <br>&emsp;The strict basics are not in this case important, for their belief in continuity is but a fair and accepted status of things, by which our detailed regards can particularly apply. 
   <br>&emsp;But as remarks sufficeincy, our understanding is sweltered by our own experience and its ambigious care for real living; to which proficeincy, or further provisional effort, is not so clearly staked upon. In other words, one side sees more which can be earned, to which provision becomes a higher concner; while the measure of living, and its more or less disregard for provision, makes sufficeincy truly so, and frugal at that.
   <br>&emsp;This is fair, and easy for me to say. Yet, if I were to subject this to someone other, I could not entirely explain. For one, the aim of living is unclear, as referring it as living is not so definite. Provisions are not either, but the purpose of such is at least more precise in the particulares. Good living does not lack this, but it not so happily stated, as the point of it is not as clear as in the case of desire or possession, but experience and activity. Which indeed has particularity, but not to any strict degree. It moreso relfects a life which is satisfied, secure, and accordingly open to things which the consquent state sees. This we call liberty, in that we life as if we are free; and pursue, engage and contriubte, with no concern of a return, but our invovlement. Hence the notion of living, as you are, within such steps, alive. While concerning yourself with what you get, means your waiting. "When, and if so what, would be good in and of itself, for you not to be concerned about what you'd lose or fail to receive. What thing tastes good enough to be fufilling by simply being tasted." 
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, the candid point is whether or not a point of liberty is suitable, in that one may be unbecoming in their point of security. This is indeed hard to say. But I can say, from the ground up, that not much is really of need beyond nourishment and shelter. Everything else is more or less uncommon, or accessible through the environemt as it stands. At least in terms of safety, the bulk of it is not so insurable by money, but your civil fortune. And when it comes to specifics, they fairly build ontop of this principled model, and not the other way around. For in this sense, we assume the notion of liberty, and the complexion of our response being but of a more postivie and generous kind (coompared to the baser ones of retreat and or removal). 
   <br>&emsp;And the point, is that if someone is at peace, then they will be more open; naturally by their calmness, and to things which are by this state seen. Such sights are considered liberal goods, as they come from secure living. In contrast to this is passion, which is a sort of drag, or that of relief, whereby work is softened through impurity. There is also a sort of discipline which one embraces if their view of sufficeincy is farther off; or, if for whatever reason, proficeincy is more needily sought, for luxury and novel occasion.
   <br>&emsp;Beyond this dynamic though, lies the possible contrition as to whether someone is being nieve or ignorant in their peacefull state. Are they forgetting something? Is their steadyiness likely to be vain, or evidently futile? This is odd, for if it was not, then the principal needs were met. 
   <br>&emsp;I can say, that principle is based on primacy, in that, deeper truths hold core relations to shallower ones. These can be added surely; but in doing, become somewhat ingrained to the principal. For instance, our needs as a man is for food and shelter, and equally for a partner. By all accounts, the need of another person would simply add 50% from our total needs into this three person account. In terms of sufficency, if one person is to be fully provided for, then the extent of our suffieincy must incorporate that amount. Duly, if my portion satisifes me, and my partner their own, then the extra whole which we must account for can be fairly met by increasing each of our sufficeincys by 50%: from 1+1 to 1.5+1.5. By this statement, the specifics may vary for either of the members and that of our obligate. I may need less, .9 per say, while my partner may inherently require 1.4, and our child 1.7. As partners, we would need a total of 2.3, totalling 4 with the child. By that, our average contribution to the whole would be 2; and the increase from your own accordingly varies. 
   <br>&emsp;What must be recalled though, is that however these accounts are determined, they are, ideally, done so primarily with sufficeincy in mind. At least with the aim to establish such point. From there, proficeincy can be garnered, and determined. For we may be fine at 2.3, but require an extra .2 for a car. Or if our aim is to invest in home, then our portions each go up, and so forth. Again, right and wrong determine the neccessity of the specifics; while the accounting for such terms curries us a sufficeint threshold, and that of proficiency. 
   <br>&emsp;Values seem a unclear addition to this, as with all clarity, they would more than likely be a sort of need. Namely, education is a primary facet of children's lives. But what if the proces, common at least, is overly formal, slow, drawn out, flat in industry, uninspired, dissociated from decency and self regard, what then? Better yet, to add to that last point, what if the matters of character, grieving, strenght and purity, are beyond past traditions, and such matters are but abscent; as the past routes are no longer prevalent, and reasonably so, while this account of education does not include these things. Together, a lack of what religious gathering and service once gave, paired with the excess of wooden futility in schools, makes for a unappealing scenario. As it is by my accounts a diservice to withold a childs association with others; just as it would be not to give them a direction, command, insight and station for fitness, speaking, reading and arithmatic. In our time there is something called 'montessori', which gives more control to the student in what they wish to learn; though the details remain a blurr, as I am not sure what teaching is done. 
   <br>&emsp;And beyond that, as we've said, right and wrong may bear qualities and a suitable direction as regards the course and placement of the child; and at that, options of education, in that they are the prevalent occupation of the childs early times, become judged against such regards.

<div id="bookended">
   So, be it designed and or willed, or merely brought to be, or some other way, so is life, or the world rather, continuous. And however our senses are, so are they subject to that world in its own matter; but our ways and conduct, including language and behaviour, are but details of that. So if the basis for things is contrived, goverened, ordered, or somewhat ill-set, so is our place within that situated with respect to all the things around us, in how they are situated; and, as it were, beyond the basis, that our responsive nature is fair and fine to deem the world as it is, momentarily, and naturally, as our observations become prolonged.
   <br>&emsp;Because of this, there seems to be a continuity, which gives no purpose to prayer. And at that, beyond the mystery of origins, that of our portion of things, so is the majority of it without must ambiguity as being a detail of that; and accordingly, an arrangment within the broader assembly; to which the process of things, in our mortal ways, carries on in newly configured ways; as our sight, smell, hearing, memory, predilections, 'and all things meat and bone' are but part of the weaves of lifes flowing time; and so as it moves on, do we unwind, passing what we have while our sediment dissolves into the forward current. "As is the circle of things; and without much remorse; as all living beings go this way, from breathing upright, then settling into the ground for more to spring anew."
   <br>&emsp;By this, beyond the apprehension of superstition and falsity, so lies the common strides of the world. And our remarks upon it, sit, fairly to the extent that we are in fact natural, with such regards as to be so clear and fair as to the appearence of such nature. For language is an odd thing, as it indeed allows us to delay our response, ponder, and at that solve problems beyond immediate threats. And increasingly, as this goes on, that our baser concerns do not simply become stabile, but new issues arise, such as our place in time, the basis for such assembly (knowledge), and at that the conduct of the broader world. "Its as if the cease of worry regarding tigers gave rise to concerns regarding the weather, if only because we could see more of it, and that in it, more was going on." And indeed, the process of any moment in time, invovles remakrs about strides past; but so for sensibility, as the truth in things is quite constant, and at that, but appreciative for things once discovered, in that their merrits lie now evident, or run contary. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, modernity is a sort of complexion to this process, whereby the strenght of it is beyond the advents of our primitive outgrowth. The absolutes which came from that have merely been regressed from, all the while though we keep our heads turned towards it, and not what is coming in front. For here lies the world; and indeed our attention elsewhere really amounts to situating the validity of such a worlds appearence, and whether or not its evident experession is as it truly seems. As things are natural though, so are they consisent, and born from reasons that, albeit unknown, lie but deeper into the birth of the stream. And at that, place in the assmebly gives merrit to our own ways and their place amongs the evident world. For neither seem but a binding of what is timely and of matter: each of which is formed and carried with consistence. 
   <br>&emsp;The principle of life then, as respects us, is quite relevant through most of our time, and at that usefull to learn of beyond our current period. But of such period lies the roster of querries, or points of neccessary, promisig or possible application. I might say, at the base of it, lies neccessity, which can be best summized as security and affliction. One who is fed and housed, or shield from the weather at least, holds the bulk of the former, while one who is privaleged, by the times, or fortuned enough, as to extract what little there is, remarks the latter, in that ailments are suitably addressed. Beyond this, lies oppertunity, guided by ends which warrant the means to it. And indeed this dynamic is not conclusive, but if the flow of those neccessities are met, then so will oppertunity remark what truly interests you, rather than what relieves your instabilities. And although one may in fact have hold such neccesities, so may their grip be uneven, and coarse. Which brings the notion of excess, as to how we suround our sufficiency; with objects of passion, relief, or interest. Of those three, the first two remark instabilities of sufficiency, in that your worn down by them and desire relief, or are unfulfulled by the, bringing on passions, or dreams rather or riper times. But then, to that third, in interest, lies what can only be described as steady excess; whereby your eveness and strenght within sufficiency lightens your mind and senses, who then accomadte inputs which would not elsehwere be seen. Indeed this is the overall character of man, in that he sees more upon securing his prior insights. And in a word, those prior two elements remark negative responses, as their source is an unweildly irksomenessness or fatigue; while the matter of interest is a positive response, as your purpose is purely forward, in that you are not spurred by an inner wish, but an outer draw; one being a sort of parchedness, which has you reaching for things, unsteadily; while interests are about approach, in that the gleam of another merely compells you, and you are naturally drawn to it, with no hurry or haste. Passions see you still, wishing to be somewhere, and rushing to get there; but the moment is merely about one spot, with the tension being the seperation from the present and the dream. While interests are about harmony, in that you are already steady enough to give, and contribute from a point already fine. This is liberty.
   <br>&emsp;In terms of specifics, you have things like dentistry, which in a basic sense seem complimentary, as it is literaly your teeth which were talking about. Vitamin A deficeincy would be an actually issue, compared to the hygene of your teeth. Which, indeed, has modern troubles, as our food perhaps warrants more flossing. But still, the importance of cleaning is such as to permitt your care in doing it as best you can on your own. And at that, we can fairly say that a diet and fitness regime which is good in itself, supports good teeth as it is. And beyond that, are the impraactical details, of smell, and grunge. But one does clean, even if they lived rurarally, as some folk do with Bamboo. And at any rate, the facts which determine the sufficiency in this case, hold a significant solution in our own personal care. And, the promise of real dental work may be there, but so is the enormous expense of it worth being frugal about; be it in how important your teeth cleaning is, what you can do on your own, and what dental actually offers beyond that. Indeed, the subject of work benefits comes to question, in that such modern amenities are given, or made accessible. But in terms of optical, physio and dental, I cannot entirely say that their neccessity holds any respect in determining the nature of our work. For eye health, like teeth, is something that, before modernity, was but natural; and, sensibly, the shortcomings of that were mainly due to nutrition. Better yet, our modern lifestyles, in our bodily composure and use of screens, wears upon our eyes and teeth. And because our living conduct is essential regardless of such concerns, then so will the strenghts of that blossom into the minor worries of teeth. And eye health is really a matter of glasses or not. And by my accounts, your health carries most of the determination for that. Nor are glasses the harshest purchase, amounting to a couple hundred bucks. While dental varies from orthodontics to cleanings; and to whichever extent our choice of work may lessen the cost, so is the indulgene of such expense worth only the amount to which it is neccessary. As, again, the heart of the concern really is covered by our otherwise neccessary fitness. We can be resourcefull though.
   <br>&emsp;Clothing is not expensive, as the actual kinds of pieces you need are not what give any common rise in price, but brands rather. I won't even admitt a concern of purchasing such things. As, like toasters, blenders and other fixed objects, so are they high value, one time purcahses. Expenses are generally measured by anuity, in terms of rent and food namely -or perhaps medical. And my sense, is that predicting the price of yours and your childs life, is best done so through principal, reasonable application, and a more or less averaging of what may happen or change. As you do not know your fortune, or privalage at that; for dental may become inconsequential in pricing, besides its actual purpose. And from that, basic things like a toaster or a t-shirt are but the givens of life which, unlike a car or a home, are minor enough -in our simple nature at least- to be taken for granted. "One does not need concern the pricing of plates when opening a resteraunt, but the ovens, the staff, and their ability to cook."
   <br>&emsp;At the end of the day, my place in life is bookended by the sprout of a child; and so to, in our regards for that rearing, would be include all matters which we would provide them with, in their own bookend. That is the whole of it, you see. My fortune is not a concern of mine, nor of my childs. And even if I have it, so is it simply so, a fortune, as opposed to neccessity. At that, our basis is covered by all that which meets our sufficiency; and by pure principles, and their roots from us being a man, so will our child being human, and raised sensible, grant them such means for sufficeincy. And in terms of proficiency, so is this a natural occurence, in coming, by our richer developments -compared to our own at the end of youth, compared to our childs from the beginning. And so at that, the niceities and sweets of the world may come along, in access. But so is their place one of novelty, or pleasure. And in terms of resolve, one may acquire the cheeriest of living through liberal interests, or they may apply themselves beyond neccessity in order to meet their dreams and desires. But ill founded or not, so is such a route, or regards rather in our principle, but to do with proficeincy, meaning all that which affords you beyond sufficiency. And as your sufficeincy is by some means met, so will your profieiency hold an extent of things (of the novel kind) which you can afford. "A man will always provide, and none an really fail at being one. But so is a plumber proficient, relatively speaking; and any can become one, as can any parent support their child in being one. The actuall pracrice, of the long lasting position of 'a craft', is at its heart developed in motion; and at that requires no credit, but invovlement (which is itself lucrative)." And so beyond what we simply provide, so is there an ample means to earning more. And riches beyond that seem but passingly eventfull.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the riches of life come from the goods of reason, and at that liberty. Little is required but the peace and solidity of being a man. And so, my child will be raised: in order to acquire such goods. But our remarks here are such as to fairly place such a reward under pure inspection; as we would not want our child raised to live well, but be insufficient in their ability to be well off. Which, in short, is why I am happy to be so pleased with the active means for sufficeincy and proficeincy. As our family will be fairly set, and theirs later on. In that, we are not forgetting. And, at that, I need not make a promise of our childs superior means, being oppertune for an otherwise required fortune. "They may live their life by their own pace, for its own sake; and earn more as time comes along: but surley for more living to come. [as remarks the princples of value and contribution -who does not, in being there the greatest, mostly receive]."
</div>
<div id="baseforneeds">
   So, as regards sufficeincy, the means to it is proportionate to its size. And by that, principal, in a frugal sense, lowers said limit. And at that, our resourcefullness can acommdate the route to proper means, of whichever extent. And, with good sensibility, the effort required will feel just; as, by such accounts, natures demand on you will seem fair; and, at that, lovely upon success. 
   <br>&emsp;It is an interesting note as regards the prominence of our working means. As, the aim for neccessity is such, that in all honesty, the extent is moderate at best. But so may we accomodate ends beyond such neccessity. This is not to be confused, so much, with determining such ends, as if to extend the edge of what you seek, but rather to modify your means, as to be more prominent. This may come circumsntaiialy, as the times may simply offer more per unit of effort; or you may receive family fortune, or some oppertune luck. And, at any rate, the positions we apply ourselves be more fruitfull in and of themselves. The important remark is not to let our wishes wander to far, as to require we find such richer pursuits. But rather, we would be steady enough as to apply ourselves towards more lucrative means; which, in addition, may be more interesting to do. In this sense, our profiecincies may come as benefits from being so sufficient; as our steadyness may allow for riper forms of committment; and at that offer us more beyond our needs, and through means which we naturally acquired. 
   <br>&emsp;So long as we keep sufficiency in mind, and level out its natural need, then so may sweeter things beyond such neccessities blossom. In many ways this is the entire sentiment of liberty. Only, when it comes to interests purely, the purpose there is of an activity and our contribution to it; which is not something related to profiency. That is more to do with goods beyond neccessity, but still in the same realm. Or in other words, our situation in life, in the fashion of it all, may be sufficient quite easily, but may also blossom itself. The creamy outskirts of this hold the whims of passion and remedy, while the lands between hold things of a more common sort, regarding pleasure and desire. And, at the very least, the pitch of time favors all, in that you learn and output more; to which your natural pace will bring you, if not to those comfier and novel desires, but to one's more frugal, as if a layer above neccessity. 
   <br>&emsp;I would describe this in terms of ccupation, in that you are in need of one in order to reach sufficeincy. But, by the times and your ready resolve, you may, in all purity, extent your ends beyond neccessity; and, all the likely as matches the natural development of your occupation, as perhaps comes with age, aptitude and its calm application. For indeed, our life is not simply bettered and realized as we extend this furnished edge, but that of our living. Which indeed, as grounds for liberty in the simplest sense, also furnsihes it by further arrangments. We ought only to remember that the worth of our circumstance loosses itself the further we go beyond sufficiency. And considering the resolutions required for the real goods of liberty, and practical effort at that, so may a mere sufficiency be welcomed, as all time beyond is purely spent on liberty. I only mean that, naturally, and by fair resolve even, we may occupy ourselves differently, and acquire a more common reward of the desiours sort. But, perhaps, this is best said as an addition to sufficeincy, as opposed to a compramise of between further desires and not. So much as living is our claim, and our furnishings are but the sturcutre this is placed on, then so much as this is our care will be increasinagly disregard the extent of such strucutre; as, per these accounts, the worth of it becomes less so the more their is. "For the color of the sky, trees and ground are there who are even ill-sufficient; stability merely steadies one, who fairly in such shortcoming ways, seeks and means to remedy such; but, in consquence, for the peace which the goods of such freedom feed on. For that is the vector for living; while the wishes of passion and credulity merely hold a better platform: but man must not believe that what is to be held there, will come from any less effort. Hence the addage of 'enough', where worth can then be fully embellished.

<div id="acertainway">
   So the Aztec were known to conduct live sacrifices, and for superstitous reasons. The former reflects the quality of the procedure, the latter the motivation. By that, a indian tribe who executes their prisoner exhaustively, can be described as savage and ritualistic. As the motivation is not real malice, envy or greed, but the consquence of their beliefs. The spirit of it at least is drawn by a sanctitious attitude, and enacted in a savage way -meaning crudeness, wildness, barbarity.
   <br>&emsp;I only mean to say, that this sort of thing happens in certain way, in a certain time and in a certain place. And from that, the nature or progress, from earth to bone, is but a distributive process which has brought things of all sort into their according place. And at some point, the different in time, place, and proportionate details of conduct, remove my worry or fear, as such things are beyond me. I rest easily though, knowing, that of the misgivings of some supposed action, that it was done so as consquence of the behaviour at hand. And by that, savagery seems less cruel, as it is simply those privy to such, being such. Which only relieves me by not extending my view of the situation, and assuming more than what I literally know. As, being cruel in someones execution, is but a remark of the literal crudeness of the process; and not much of the time, place, or culturat attitudes can be otherwise said. "For man is always rational, in spiritidenss or civility. He conducts himself with a sort of proceducre, no matter of kind; and those invovled, delivering, viewing, or subject, partake in it as such process."

   If I met myself, at 40, what would I wish to hear? Better yet, what would I expect to hear? Concerning advice, I am sure some sensibility regarding work, the course for women and friends, and place to contribute and so forth would bring some proper insight. Which, upon thinking of it, brings those interests into a fuller light, as their worth seems the more evident; and despite their definition, yet current lack of substance, so does their future hold a certain promise; at least so much as we see them, and try.
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, what I would ask is proper sentiments and portions regarding violence and terror, the effects of peoples thinking and attitude, the more specific insights regarding climate warming, and that of MAD; along with some sensible findings regarding AI, new devices, use of interent etc. And, in generall, I would ask for a lesson in media use, as to avoid the permisucity which our leisure stains on our ignorance. 
   <br>&emsp;This is from the moment. And to be honest, I, in our current place, seem like a good figure to offer encouragment for our youger selves, who perhaps had less to look for -as we had seen less. Whereas now, I have all the cares in the world, and could die happy presently. But, in that, I only see more of our shortcomings, like bad weather which dampen our means to play. And, at that, our current barrier to peace, lies the conceptions of those shortcomings, and the wear they place on our freer time. As, in moments of impurity, we are not only kept from otherwise goods, nor do we simply amend such mistakes and return to a point of frutifull action. Rather, upon the mistep, our new disposition sees the world from such a lens, and at that develops knowledge. "Hence somebody who, in their unsteadyness, gets impressed by the same situation than someone who is composed." And the point, is that impression, or besides that, passion, become part of our inclinations and reproach: as if, in this impure state, our expereince acts like all expereince, in that we learn something, adjust, prepare and defend. Practically speaking, the density of these insights may be low, and get washed away by their starvation (considering our irreularity of being in how they are made, and at that tenured); that, or contrasting insights push them. Which, oddly, is like filling out a volume with one substance, but pushing out a solid object, as opposed to simply whitherhing the object down. As that being said, the common response is one of repute, where we say why an insenesibilitties are ill founded and wrong. Which is fair upon relfection, as we notice that part of our wishes or fear is off. Yet, what I find, is that this then calls for a truth, or at least a compliment to the refutation, 'as if we said that so and so is wrong, and because, or at least to mention, it is not like that.' And an understanding of 'that' is difficult produce. As at the back of our impressive whims, lies dissproprionate views on violence, government, people; at least, namely, things of a broader and (prone to be) dramatic sort. As such topics are the most unknown, in a truly obvious way, but hold the most believed sway; and fairly so. But their massiveness, timeliness and detail, get lost in our furried minds. And considering their nature as powerful forces, the error in believing them to be as they in fact are not, holds an according stress and misery.
   <br>&emsp;As for why we wish to tend to such misgivings, or poor assumptions, we must ocnsider how we got them in the first place: namely, our prudent mistakes. For, in being prudent, we are, in means as to bear prudence, and, for the effect of clearness and solidity, open yet evened out in our expression and impressions of the world. Nothing gets jumbled around, nor overly portioned. At that, odd things may come in, mingle around and find their place amidst what we already know. And we may then think, form, and at that assemble with more substance and exubrency. Moreocver, if awry or cheap impressions come in, from rumors or advertisment, the poorness of it does not cause a course defense, as if some poison is getting in. By our common stires, we simpyl pass by; or, like all things, it simply settles, finds its place as it is deemed fit, and otherwise gets blown out. But with steadyness and grace, rather then denial, fear or nievety.
   <br>&emsp;Maybe, overall, the reason I care so much about how I see, feel and think, as that our actions and values are traditionally off. And by our expected interests of association, and fear of being critizcies, or at least feeling embarrased or unsure how to say how I am, so do I solidify how I really see. For a man may live norammly and peacefully; but upon association, tighten up that common view; if only because it situates itself outside the futility and ignorance of common norns; notably, superstition and equity. And at that, I hold no common fears, which are themselves born of cheap impressions and dry judgement.  As it were though, the times are such that tradition still holds its sway. For even though the complexion of things is changing, so is it all along the same line. Different ways to make money, alternative ways that equally overlook the point of our healht. And so, as a boy, in these times, I over-corrected, forming my views and understanding as not only to simply be, but defend it; and, admittedly, by our own ignorance and satiety, acquire. "Which itself borough much confrontation and dissent, by trying to make our ways seem beyond acceptable, but worthy, as to earn and recieve." At any rate, our over-correction saw a blossoming of our values and understanding, and at that produced something beyond content, but a flourishing. And, indeed, this appraoch did not come from soul purity, but a mismatch of juvenile wishes, paired with an dissmisal of common fears and practice. As a man though, I can say, perhaps with a final comment, that my struggle is in really being one. For I am in fact left with a tapestry of peace and well being, shouldered mind you by acceptence and mere grace. But is that what I want, is such suffiecinecy really where I want to be? I suspect that I am afraid not to reach what my less than mature self once wished for, and at that grew to expect. The thing is, that the neccessity of doing so, as if to show your worth is gone. It is merely a matter of you, and the fact which remakrs your interest.

<div id="jedi">
   So the Jedi have a council, and at that act as the oracles of the republic. Their fear though, is that the senate holds to much auhority over the conduct of things; and this, against their wisdom, troubles them. 
   <br>&emsp;Anakin is having premonitions about his wife, as he did his mother. And indeed, this proclivity of his for attachment and fear of loss, was noticed by Yoda when he was first brought to Coruscant; and, by the common remarks of his age being to old to train, this reason thus begins to exhibit. 
   <br>&emsp;The thing is, that upon letting Yoda know of these premonitions, the advice he is given is to learn to let go, and not fear to lose. Yet the Jedi are doing the exact same thing. In fact, the moment right after Anakin and Yoda converse, he meets with Obi-Won, who says that the Chancellors hold over the senate is to be feared. Then, in part due to Palpatines toying, the Jedi ask Anakin to spy on the Chancellor. Which Anakin finds troubling indeed. As his scenario is such, that he must hide his love for his wife, along with being afraid of how that will go through; and he is in conflict due to this allegiance to the Jedi and their ways; which he indded has shown by prior heroic acts. 
   <br>&emsp;But what happens when an alternate path is offered to him, and the dedication he had elsewhere seems both unlaudible or of interest. For the trouble Anakin has comes from his attachments and the friction this brings agasint being a Jedi. But if the Jedi are not to be respected, then a path elsewhere which reflects your wishes, seesm preferable. For the trouble will remain so long as your commitments conflict with your desire. But if those commitments wain, then so can you go where you desires are treated. 
   <br>&emsp;Unfortunately, the tragedy, is that the path offered to treat such desires was not one truly producitve for them. As it were, without said desires, the Jedi's contradictions may invoke a change of direction. But the Jedi's flaws were never so much that their directoin was off, but their overly reserved ways. Which indeed houses the contradiction, when in fact, as regards their fear of control, they were not reserved. The moral is that they should have been more understanding, and aware at least of their contraiety as to not do so in one way but do so in the other. As, such weakness of credulity, brought someone to an alterantive path with the pure motive to succeed in ways which their prior path forbid. But this new path was not a preferable one ultimately; for the love he had at least. The Jedi ought to have fostered that love, and nourished some sensibility and temperence as to keep it moderate and in check. But the strenuous reproach led Anakin to take another hand, if only because there was nowhere else to go. "Hence the susceptibility of those afraid in turning to the dark side."
   <br>&emsp;<br>&emsp;So, the committment to the Jedi is a strong one, as the purpose of it seems preferable. As Anakin says, 'the Sith draw on passion to treat their selfish desires, while the Jedi are compassionate in their selflessness'. And indeed, the latter is preferable. Only, what if the Jedi are questionable as to thir selflissness? Maybe their lack of being so isnt a warrant to become selifish. Only, what if the thing preventing you from doing so is a dedication to being selfless, as if its a responsability -in this case pulling against your desire. 
   <br>&emsp;The sith corrupt those who are keen to join them, promising great bounty, when in fact there is only pain. At least their rewards have a cost. The mistake of the Jedi is in their flaws, and how the greedy nature of the sith merely exposes that, saying, in effect, that one ought not worry about being selfish, when all in fact are.
   <br>&emsp;That is the trouble you see, when your principles are inherited and strict. Any contraiety to that breaks the credulity, and theres no natural temperence to remain. That is what Anakin should have been offered, some sensibility. But the strictness of the Jedi forbode it; and indeed, his emotions were primed from the start, and thus he was in conflict between his obligations and desire. He could not manage one, and as the fear of the other grew, so do his concerns of the the former whither; and at that, comes the great tragedy, that he was drawn into an alternative. The Jedi should have protected him from this. But they could not even admitt the knowledge of the sith, as per their words, 'we would see it'. They didn't even know Anakin was being influenced. And indeed, Anakins doubt in the council could simply lead him to leave and go his merry way; but his fears, hidden mind you amidst his post as a Jedi, bubbled up to a point where temptation took him. Perhaps if the Jedi were more natural in their temper, as opposed to being severely orthodox, Anakin could address his feelings and learn to better deal with them. But trouble was all that lay, in his hiding; and being so confused and alone, a fatal offer was taken.
   <br>&emsp;The moral of Star Wars is that light always wins, for the dark is always seeking, and at that ultiamtely subject to things greater then themselves. Light is natural, as it simply mirors the common flow of things; which even over the might and strenght of the darkest user, still gets blown away. But when the light wishes for control, out of fear even, then so does the practice of the light loose to the meaner spirit of the dark. The source of the apprhension of the light, and their consquent position to be so aganist a dark user, comes from being too orthodox; as one never grows outside the instilled norms, and at that, most become idle and stiff to changing ways. Their too protectice as not to be bad, but in being overly reproached, they hold no prescence, and at that allow more forward users to step in. And then, when their natural fear of anothers complete power steps in, so do they become more forward. Yet, they are blind to the fact that they are even going against themselves. As, the story goes that the strenght of their practices instills a sort of credulity and respect; but lingers over time on pure credulity and homage, as opposed to the fruits of growth and change. And so when time moves on and new challenges come in, all they have are their long lasting customs. And as they are then asked to change, their credulity is shaken, nor are they so fit to be so offensive. 
   <br>&emsp;To which, the moral of life, is be there with things as they flow. For, in doing so, you never are infront, nor behind. 
   <br>&emsp;<br>&emsp;Anakin's turn to the dark side is more of an agreement, whereby his allegiance to the Jedi as no more, and he becomes a sith. He does this because of the promise recieved by palpatine, and the removal of care for the Jedis reservations of that. As Palpatine says, 'turn me in yes, but you are not so sure of the Jedi's intent, what they will do'. And Anakin says he will learn the truth. And when Mace Windu forbids him to come, he pleas, but agrees; as, suspectedely, he doubts their treatment of palpatine, likeky considering the chances that they will kill him. And, by my accounts, Revenge of Sith as a film sets up this conflict well, souly on the basis of the premonitions scene, whereby the decides to heed Palpatines offer. The question, is why 'the no matter the cost' attitude comes into play; as upon his kneel, he abides Palpatines wish to kill the rest of the Jedi. Well, for starters, his arrival at the senate house was not to kill  Mace Windu, but to insure that Palpatine lived. He demands that he should stand trial, and to do otherwise is not the Jedi way. And as Mace Windu acts against which Anakin believed once so neccessary -and as he regrets upon killing Count Dooku- he cries 'I need him', and at that prevents Mace from unfairly taking what he wants. 
   <br>&emsp;Some of the dialogue which follows is important, as Anakin's convergence with Palpatines plans is moreso abuot an acceptence that the Jedi are A) wrong (however exaggerated this is), and that B) they are now enemies, if only because they will be against the sith. The remark as to their intent to take over the senate is unclear, as the suspicion that they will is not so consquent of Mace's actions of killing Palpatine. That was out of character, but not so suggestive of their authoritive plan. 
   <br>&emsp;I guess, in attitude and passion, Anakin burrows into the Sith's side, and at that comes to terms with the opposition which he is now part of: Sith, and their evident place as part of the republic, by virtue of Palpatines current place in office, and that of the Jedi, who are against the Sith, and thus their wishes, and at that, however pilliared, against the Republic -by some concieved notion that they seek power.

<div id="presumedregard">
   So woke up, opened the outdoor cuboard, and saw a rat in a cage. I don't know how long it had been in there, nor am I clear on his experience. It would seem fair to suppose it was not swell, but I can not exactly say. For I do not know if it was bored, anxious, worried about some meeting the next morning; or if it was merely hungry, thirsty or cold. At any rate, I would not suppose it is claustrophobic, at least by any sense I would be.
   <br>&emsp;But interestingly, as I take myself out of its shoes, and hold no presumed regard, I see how the unclear world of others around closes in on it; as if I must be present in order to shield any notion of avarice or vice. For its eyes are not truly puppydog, nor is its squeels that distinct from others. Oh cute we say, or awwwh, but I don't know why. And as I seperate myself from that, but also don't pretend to know the motions, time or assembly of its expereince, I see that our surrounding views close in. Which, at any rate, brings the value of properly seeing the world; for I have seen that man does not genuinely wish to harm another, and, as of late, nor for animals. And at that, the simplicity of animals is something I don't fully respect, and at that I am reproached into thinking that they are stumbling fools like people; that, or that their expereince is somewhat destined for failure, if only by our ambiguity.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, I made a mistake, in that I did not check the trap till the morning after it was set. It is only likely that the rat was in their for many hours. So, we have reset them as we expect other rats, and my attention will go into checking more often. Shortly after this, during the day, after dinner and before I go to bed. "It is not for the rat's sake, as I have no conception as to whether or not it is fine: but neglecting that it is there is wrong on all counts: and drags me away from our righteous indifference."
   <br>&emsp;<br>&emsp;II
   <br>&emsp;<br>&emsp;So I was negligent the other day, to an effect whereby a simple soul was harmed. A rat was on the loose, and we set some harmless traps. But instead of checking them I forgot, and I woke up the following morning to see one in the cage. The cage was in this cupboard; sizable admitteldy, but more or less fully dark. It was in there for a day. And this upset me, not because of its expereince, by our negligence. For I do  not know if it got bored, was in any understandble way scared; and of the dark at that. But I do know, that if I left it there, that its expereince would be unneccesarily discomforting, no matter the manner.
   <br>&emsp;And I see our views on things as such, that, of a bad theory, it is not excusable for one less sure. We ought solve problems, learn and explore. But fitting holes with assumptions is a false claim. And by that, with the entirety of time, motion and assembly as our backdrop, I say little within our claim. But, so do we fear all but all, as we know so little: nor are others equally ill-found views worth any more. 
   <br>&emsp;At that, wisdom points and tempers us, to which I see what is really of genuine worth. And by that, I see that life holds proportions, of which our observations and understanding cannot elicit. Time can bear us one, but so will our sense always be but that; and all whims beyond hold nothing but an excessive certainty.
</div>
<div id="theneedtoassume">
   So there sits a line, which we'll say marks the flow of life, and at that the proper signal of response. Only, behaviour gets warped, or disposed in ways that bring it into a state of reservation or excess. Why each point beyond the natural one manifests is its own detail, but that there is one is clear. 
   <br>&emsp;As I see it, there is a reason to be virtuous, in that you are actually one with the world. There is a sort of credulity and sanctity which comes from such merrits, to the point where vice is not merely disposed against, but fought against; as if it so bad that we must make sure to never reach it. This seems impart to religion, or superstition, as such beliefs hold one to be proper in certain ways, but wrong if they are not. And the weakness is that the treatment of virtue is not so much for us and our peace, but that of a higher power: as if our actions are serving it. Which indeed bellows under the actual form of nature, along with the honoring of it, as if nature was not, in whichever form, some assmebly, motion and timely thing; while the ancient norm was to pretend like it cared, in a anthropic sense.
   <br>&emsp;What we should do otherwise is hard to say. But I will note this lingering feeling that, be it from this or that source, that a great deal of formal superstition that remains, of theism namely, lies in categories of things; which is to say, that beyond the things that are, so do we classify them. Which indeed is not a theistic exlucisve, but finds its lasting remarks there. In general, meta-physics is theistic if their is intent in the assmebly of nature; otherwise, it is but a base ontology. 
   <br>&emsp;I guess I find much distrust in both the output and sentiment of categories; for I don't believe they are much more than concepts born from expereince; and, at that, the root of our current set, is purely from Aristotle and Kant. Physics, Chemistry, Biolgy and all other things, have gone beyond such times, and at that, there seems not much sense or conception which isn't simply an extension of older ways, but developed to fit the current physical model. I admitt that there is some, but my view is generally of those endowed to such model and passive to any abstractions; or there are those who value such abstractions, but derive them, at heart, from such older ways, and merely polish them to meet the newer models. I see little, at least I have not discovered or been shown a truly remarkable set of writings or inquiries regarding a truly modern set of abstractions, as born and produced from our physical sense of the world. "Leibniz to me, merely used his genius to arrange Aristotles and Plato's parts." 
   <br>&emsp;I'd say the crux of modern philosophy lies with those who truly append, but form their own expereince. Our mountains are high as we have seen, rather than that which has been known. As no one cares for classical mechanics, truly, as science has moved beyond that. And at least for me, I don't think all the properties which we deemed essential within our abstractions hold an obvious place in our modern time. At least, I feel like most of them are stemming from simpler things. And it is of those which I mean to understand, and at that, upon ou physical knowledge, inquire. "Is that but the course of a Man doing what he ought to do? Who will truly be done?" For instance, I suspend my beliefs on the basis of things. But so much as our grip on physics is fair, so do we know that much of what we see as complex is really a weaving of baser elements. Literal elements are simply made of electrons, protons and neutrons, and assembled via the strong and eelctromagentic forces. These even or but ripples in their inherent fields, as are the particles likewise (in their own inherent fields). And fields at that are but decouplings of something, supposedly, fundemental. My point then, is that besides the question of nominalism or realism, why not simply remark detail? For, the basis for protons, for instance, is unknown, or its fields and the soul field at that. But we do know that there is not much beyond that; and as blue and yellow mixed remain as such yet producre the phenomena of green, so does the assmebly of pieces remain. This seems less nominal, in that each piece is really not unique. But I don't think it an interesting question. At least, if you qualify the arrangements that we see as mere assemblies of the same pieces, than of those pieces there merely are. And the knowledge we seek then is to how the arrangments find their according form. Which, in an odd way, is something we are quite acquainted with; as the sun is found through clumping hydrogen, planets from the excess debirs of this, life from violent springs in the developing planets and so forth. The farther question is of what we suppose are the pieces and the creation of that. But so are we limited there, and at that fair to only inquire. But, as I believe that if you knew the function of the basic field, how it decoupled into particle and force fields, how these perturbed into galaxies and the constituetn stars, that you could almost literally trace the arrangments we see from that basic function. 
   <br>&emsp;This does indeed bring other questions; but so does wisdom bring our questioning together, as to say, however unknown, that so would so and so mean this. I don't know if that is so, but, the conseuqence of it feel fair to accept if it was. Namely, that if energy was distributed, clumped via the uneveness of this distribution -with our admittence of gravity- then so would the dots of this cluming, macro wise in galaxies and micro wise in stars, than the planets which came about through the later, served as the fair hotsprings for organice chemsitry to ensue, and at that the microbe fossils evdient from 3.5 BYA. The proccess of this is unclear, and that which followed; but by virute of carbon dating and investigative techniques, so is such evidence reliable. "Which we might say, of such evident, that it points to a spot within a process."And of this process, it seems hollow to supect, that as evident as the physical processes are to create the stars and planets, that someting other than a continuation of that to create microbes occured. For one, we either accept or deny the evidence of microbes; and, fairly, attribute our own development as part of that process. And, removing then the importance of us, and getting to the core point, is whether life, or the microbes which are the objects of that, came to be through chemistry, or intervention? And, to be clear, the basis for fields may be so divine; but of such divine, what it produced was a contrinous stream of things, so far as stars and planets are concenred. And thinking that, from the brith of things, that such a divine continuity became suddenly undivine, is suspect. My suspcions tell me that our lack of understanding how the physical process from planets to microbes occured, leaves room for ill set reasoning, as to the potential intervened causes.
</div>
<div id="onparts">
   As a matter of inquiry, or discourse rather, we must define pieces. Simply, if we have lego bricks, parts, components, strands etc., so do these wind together to form higher order arrangments. And of their origin as pieces, or so much as the fabric is involved, so is that our speculative nature of things.
   <br>&emsp;Simply, if the fabric and or pieces, has a sort of mindfull intent at the root of it, then so is this the domain of theism: theos literally meaning that which intentfully governs. There is mind you, some distinction between deism and theism, but the continuity of the former does not so much seperate itself from the heart of the latter, which is to say that theism does not in principle, denote a governance which is otherwise willy-nilly. It would be better to remark the nature of such theism, of which deism is but a short-hand which remarks a certain property.
   <br>&emsp;Indeed, the whole of things may be so, as not to warrant erroneous expectations, nor, despite our efforts, a compartmentalized arrangmenet: as if their truly are pieces and an assembly. It is, in fact, more likely that all is comparable, and that as the basis for a piece, be it theistic or natural, so is a less piece-meal domain one of equal basis -at least we may regard it as so. Indeed, the trouble of a basis comes to form, when we see little explanation for all the distinction in the world if in fact all is the same: for there is an evident contradiction to that. But we may rejoice in the details of which our homogenous form ought produce, and that science, or a theory regarding the conduct of existence, is souly on the product of that. "Why, with such universality, is there A) perterbations, as in the waves of a universal ocean, and B) how, specifcially, such waves arise -to which we may presume, or deem them inherent- and that, in total, which interactions occur to create the expontential detail. At that, ontology is a sensibility of origins and form, as to the prescence of material, and our understanding of how it operates as to exhibit complexity: such an understanding marks our law, or definition rather, of something evident of a process which the law suggests."
   <br>&emsp;The dialectic is the coarsest result of man's effort. For, if he is still questioning then is truly not within one. Yet, so long as he cannot remain limbre and spry (in his reasoning) than the contradictions of parts and wholes will arise. Indeed there is some speculative sensibility, as to know the complexion of things which run against universality. But while this sense is offers merrit in being reserved, so is there a forward pitch to our inquiry, whereby we qualify things with more definitive truth, whereby the perpetual determination and concession of the dialectic wains. For the soul cause of such waivering is in the presumptive use of terms; indeed laying the basis for our reproach. All the while, qualities, or intelligible neccessities, form a positive denotion for the basis and structure of things. Perhaps, the ability for their to be both comes from a evoltion beyond the assumptions of the former and the properties it is deemed to contain. "As by my accounts, the prescence of structure is no evidence of their being anything at all: at least, it holds nothing but an insight to how nature behaves. Nature may not be absolute though, and as stucture is but a weaving of such fabric, then so, quintessentially, are such products equally so: and in some sense irrelevant to the discussion. As, per our insight, laws are but schemes, in the way that words are but sharpenings of baser grunts. And, as in the case of speech and cognition, so is truth in things rooted in the ability to speak: which itself is endowed within reactions, and their consquent draw of the subjects sound: to which, upon much subsquency, such sound is sharpened, and at that levelled off to further recieve. As the mystery of all that comes from the latter (subsequence) is but a process understood by law, but born of basic stuff, so is such stuff the principle of discovery: as knowing it marks the truth, while understanding it, merely shows how it behaves: and mistaking that for what it is, tells the problem in philosophy."
</div>
<div id="merethought">
   I lack the words, though my prior thought held truth.
   <br>&emsp;The issue with living, is that it seems so defined, yet unclear only because we don't have our finger on the pulse of it. But, at the core of it, despite bearing the most technical load, we don't know. 
   <br>&emsp;And my thinking is that, of our efforts, they are to grow, to really learn and inquire. And the only way to do this is to think; no conlcude or know, but to consider, proceed, refine.
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, all the evidence in the world merely points to what real knowledge must describe:  as such a process is but demonstrated through the evdience of it. And, much of what we think is knowledge is really a description, of how, some far below process creates what we see today. Yet, qualifiying this, what we see to day is not much more than the arranmgnets of basic things; and at that, the question is not how these higher order things came to be, but how the basic pieces relate. "As it just becomes, in general, a matter of statsitics, in terms of distribution, and a more applied process of which our common inishgts reflect. We undersatnd accretion disks, buit not how the matter got there in the first place; nor where matter came from in and of itself."
   <br>&emsp;On that note, just as we are merely working back to knowledge, but simply through understanding, so does that knowledge, which amounts to thought, earn its merrit by being ammicable to the products of its being. We must remember that laws and proofs are generally higher order, or more localized and shallower than the baser processes below. But, of that deepest process, and whether or not it is layered upon something non-processive, or that such process is the base, none can say. But we can think, and at that, mould a proper inquiry as to what such a base should hold, and how the appearence of nature is as to engrave the trajectory of that process.
   <br>&emsp;At the end of the day, as my clear thinking has become a haze, I see that our inquiry is based on this approach, of offering mere thought and nothing more. I can say that the point of this is to say what things are, and at that qualify their being with respect to things which we are trying to prove; in the sense, that theism is a mindfull governance, but in effect holds no neccessity of a non-continuous life. Nor is it a fair assumption that life is born through intent. In other words, we can say what life is, or the appearnce of things which we mean to prove; but then, through a sort of principle, ontology and descriptive physics, say, that of such explanations, that they may be done thruogh so (ie. theism or naturalism), but that of such explanations, this is all they mean, and furthermore to what they can proport. 
   <br>&emsp;I can see this, really. But I cannot say why else we should not otherwise explore. Like theres this negative of conlcusion and not suggesting; as if we are wrong to theorize and presume the basis for existence, and at that what existence is. I can say, by virtue of our limits via inquiry, that words and ideas are all we have, and that the complexion of this needs a mere mention on the page. Yet theres this tradition and identity, of who we are; and I care little for this. But all the while I know what to do, I cannot cleary say, why theres shortcomings to the contrary. What is it we are doing in that sense, or not doing in our current one.

<div id="fairnotion">
   So one of the issues in dealing with parts, is that considering atoms as such is too derived a notion. Atoms, are assemblies of protons, neutrrons and electrons; these hwoever, are assemblies of quarks for the former, and at that, quarks, and the electron, are exhibitions of a field; and, each particle is an exhibition of its own field (in kind at least); and at that, there lies an exhibition of a field which acts as forces between the partciles, namely the electromagnetic force, which carries a force between electrons (allowing them to bind), and the strong force, which holds the quarks and thus protons together. There is this modern notion of decoupling, whereby energy states in a field create energy more or less, and at that introduce the currents which will exhibit the forces and particles. Whether or not this decoupling comes from a soul field, and at that is a mere motion of such field, is hard to say. In common regards this field is called the Inflaton; though much research is required on the whole. 
   <br>&emsp;All I mean to say, simply, is that as we discern very little distinction from a planet and sun, that so may we hold an equally small distinction between particles and forces. Even if we took the exhibitions for each quark, electron, strong and electromagnetic force, so would an atom be but an ostensible derivation of such things. 
   <br>&emsp;The question really, beyond origins, is why an quark is bound to act as it does, and so forth for electorns. And, perhaps, why each force is bound to carry its host to whichever end. This indeed holds much ambiguity between the actions of each part, and their supposed basis (the inflaton etc.). But, we can say, despite knowing that such pieces are not truly the basic fragments, that of such pieces, so are they more basic then protons and neutrons, atoms, molecules, and consequently bodies of these. 
   <br>&emsp;Man's geatest mystery is in his suspense, as the understanding of how the earths crust formed, for instance, is discovered through higher order observations, rather than understanding how each basic piece operated as it did. This is so, for despite knowing much of the progress of matter, so is the basis for it still unclear; and at that, why there is 'perterbations' or differences rather in the early progression, and consquently dissproportionate gathering, cannot be said. But in that sense, we can lay with our more or less relevant understandings of the higher kind, while we simply articulate a possible strucutre underlying it; all the while we orient such assembly upon a potential basis; which itself can be qualified, as in the case for theism.
   <br>&emsp;On that basis, my intent in this inquiry is to appropriatley remark things, all the while considering the common conceptions which may otherwise pull against us. It least that which is more popularly supposed. In that sense, as we consider the assemblies of higher things as mere arranged motions of baser pieces, that so are such arrangments things of an ostensible sort, 'or in other words a surface appearence, or detail of the baser nature'. The development though, is that as the sun and moon are within the same realm of things, that so are the working pieces which they are a mere detail for, perhaps too general to be such basis. To be clear, we do not mean so much that atoms are the basis of nature, but rather that they are the effective components of the higher strucutre which we see as evidence; in the way that rock structures form out of whithering, yet are still in fact composed of rock. The question, is that in that case, if we are trying to understand rock, and leave the formation of it as a mere detail, that so is rock in that case not the primary component. As rocks are made of something and so forth. And, as a sort of footnote, that our cognitition, speech and sense that things are real in their higher order, so would I refer to a shadow as being something alarming, but then realized to not be there; which is what rock strucuttres are, in that their form, so is it but our peculiar nature which sees more than what is really there. And to remove that point, we can actually look at what something is; whereupon our deeper understanding can explain how rocks and their structure came to be, and, admittedly ourselves. The truth though, is that we need not pretend like rock arch is distinct from rocks, and rocks distinct from atomic metal. All forms of things are merely chemcial arrangments, and linked as so through the electrogmatnetic force pairing the electrons within each atom; which are themselves bound in orbit to protons and neutrons (or the nucleus). At this point we cannot precisley say where the difference lies between such particles and their fields. But we can say, with a submission to detail, that the combination of atoms and molecules is but a complex of those finer portions: namley the strong and electro force, with the quarks and electrons.  Which, in its own right, is a fairer model compared to the prior basic one, whereby electrons, protons and neutrons were such; while now, the forces are included, the nucleus particles are but clumpings of up and down quarks. Protons are made of 2 up and 1 down quark, neutrons are made of 1 up and 2 down quarks. Up quarks have a charge of +2/3, while down quarks have one of -1/3.  Giving protons a plus 1 charge, and neutrons a 0 net charge. 
   <br>&emsp;All there is in life is these pairings of up and down quarks, held together by gluons (the strong force), and orbited by electrons, which bind to other electrons (from other atoms, or electrons orbiting other clumps of quarks) via the electromagentic force.

<div id="heatofinquiry">
   It is true, that the earth orbits the sun, and because it also rotates on its own axis, so does the sun appear to rise. All that is happening, is that from a point on Earth's surface, so is the axis spin moving you away from the direction of the sun. 
   <br>&emsp;Now, Man has created calendars, and sensible times at that as to correspond with this progression. Only, these are but arbitray markers; as the actual effect going on is one of axis-spin. And because of that, so could the markers which segment this process be of any sort. I am in fact no sure why 24 hours was choosen, as 36 or a 100 even could have. And in that sense, hours and clocks are but descriptions of a baser process; and our knowledge of that is deeper than relying on contrived descriptions. In fact, one can understand the Sun's motions simly by seeing its increase in the height of its zenith, and the earlier point in which it rises. It is approaching the summer solstice. And the moon similarly, goes through its own motions. And perhaps, are remark of such motions are such, as to be deeper, and thus knowledgable, the more we speak of the actual motions, and not some conceptual scheme. Hours are arbitrary, orbits and spin are actual.
   <br>&emsp;This is just an example of how our view on things may be conceptual or actual. And from this, we need not shuffle over the prescence of baser questions which our local knowledge sits. As I cannot say why the sun sits where it does and draws our planets motion; but of it doing so, so is this true, while clocks are a mere concpetion to understand this. The point being, that of the reason for what we know of day, seasons and night, I do not know. But, in terms of the subject, namely those motions, so can we know those, if only incompletely due to their own basis. 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, my aim is to say what something is, and remain intelligble amidst our purest uncertainty. Habits and skills remark this in terms of driving, in that, one may say concentrate here or act in this way, when in fact, all that is happening is that the process of the enginge engages so much as your foot hits the pedal, and proportionaly releases fuel to engage the engine. In that, our skills are such as to be as such, skilled, in our operation of the thing. But most people look outside the actual process, of which we are conducting, and focus on the environment, as to say (in this case), when you should speed up or slow down. And my sense, is that rules are such, as if common conduct, but so is a brick wall ahead a clear prompt to stop: and knowing that doing so is more than pushing the breaks is important, as that is not the extent of knowledge as remarks doing that: as their is a process which your engaged with, and in a way as your actions desire. But, if we start to far up, then our aim will be to focused on, and the means to heeding it will be via surface level grasp on the process which actually orients your response. "Our knowledge is so as deep as our action comes from. And I find, in our life, that in terms of who we are and what the world is, that so do norms, common beliefs and presumed concerns, loose their shallow standing: as the depths of our orientation, as to respond with fullness as to how the world is, beckons the view of such world. As police see crime everywhere, or thiefs oppetunity, so does one knowledge of nature hold an according direction to act upon."
   <br>&emsp;Nature is a sort of fabric, with timely and constituent properties of a mysterious sort. This fabric weaves though, and the finest of datum suggest this basic universality. In that sense, fields exhibit the body and relations of particles, and at that the unison of broader structure. The placement of these structures can be traced to the slight fluctuations within the baser fabric; of which the granted effect of gravity creates dissproprtionate assemblies. "The Perado principle as its known." This clumping amounts to simple elements coming together, and upon the densest points, causing further regions to orbit. These are the realms of nebula, the birthing places of stars. Which, begin as galaxies do, in their clumping of matter (hydrogen in this case), of which the central point (where theres the highest density) creates a star. This star, unlike a galaxy, creates heat via fussion, whereby the matter gets so bound together that it excretes energy; and, in this process, creates denser elements such as helium, carbon and iron. Alongside of this,  as there are orbiting regions of stellar material in galaxies, so is there orbting materials around star. This debris clumps together, and upon doing so continiously, creates planets. Of the planets infancy, much is unable to be said. What is supposed is fairly done so, but so are the specifics unclear. At the very least, the principles by which the sun formed are more clear than those which remark the developments of the Earth's crust, the prescence of water (and the atmosphere at that), and, namely, the prescence of life. It is known through carbon dating, that microbial organisms were present some billion years after the Earth's origins: 3.5 billion years ago relatively speaking. And from there comes evidence of a stirctly local sort, in terms of more recent kinds of organisms, and clearer status' of the planet regarding its crust and atmosphere. These remarks are segemented first into eons, beginning with the hellish Hadeon, followed by the water world of Archeon, and then into the multicellular/eukaryotic eon of Protzera, all climaxing into the birth of fish, insects, plants and mammals: the Phenozoic. At this point, the admittence of bones, neural tissue, blood, permiits one to look past the particular motions which gave birth to things such as memory, vision and dexterity, but to focus on these things themselves. And beyond this lies technology, governance and culture: which, comparably, builds upon such prior basis', in that those deal with what it is to be Man, while the civil range remarks our own operations and creative assembly. 
   <br>&emsp;"The basis of nature created atoms which respond to others, and all under gravity; and that from this, structures such as rock were subject to the assemblies of lava and wind. This housed, and at least proported the means, for organic structures to act, and by that, replicate, of which squirells and man are a further development. And as that has created animals, and ones with vision, hearing, smell, touch, and taste, so has such response clarified into words and concepts: all as sort of grunting apprhensions, and the distinctions in that to create the suyllablkes of identity. And so by that, in our identitive path, lies the current approach to the modern world, whereby our guidance by such concepts (as identitifed and spoken) hold a unparrallel communion with other beings of an equal sort: by those who have identified things differnetyl, by their own weaving of grunted disctinn.
   <br>&emsp;Here lies the current quest for true knowledge, as to better refine what we have identified: for that man, the animal, who saw the stars, pointed, and made a different remark, still lives, and in this nearness to modernity remains: he must only, amidst brothers, soceity, enemies and friends, work to act as he sees fitting: and with the operative sensibility to remove ambiguity and contrivance, so as to demonstrate merrit amongst those who see otherwise: and, at that, within the process by which we inquires, so may he listen, as such approach is merely such, and accordinlgy not a process of conclusion, but technique. 
   <br>&emsp;At least, in his certainty he lies alone, for only as such can he make such a outright claim; while all others believe what their own technique has shown them; and perhaps, they have made their own rightfull claim; only, they are all the likely convinced by their own thinking, and to an argumentative end, as opposed to one of demonstration: as such a mark, however incomplete, or unedning in its sought for reach, is something beyond the concepts of men, but a truth regarding nature herself: while those former, who may in fact ardently know, merely do so relatively by others: by which we say that most in their certainty, embellish so through pedantic scrutiny, or bravdo: and at that, hold no real claim than having not which is known: but so then do they lie, in the wake of all others who are equally mistaken. And when we consider why the truth is important at all, in that basic primitivity of identity, so do we see why the confuision of others along with ourselves, merely adds to the stress of being unknown: for so many are equally lost: of which man knows drives violent actions born of fear. But so doth modernity lay, for one, or some, who have the bravery to know that in that chaotic misery, lies an end and comparsion to that which is free and peacefull: whereby we can see, in calmer moments, what reality is like, and make a suggestion which does not come between that rock and hard place. 
   <br>&emsp;All the great men have exhibited themselves this way, going against the frantic conversations of those drug by theirs and others lost commissery. Socrates, Aristolte in his system, Plutarch in his geniality, Auerlius in his post; Aquinas in his scholastic attempt, Montainge in his own modern attire; Descartes in his notable declarations, of others having not much which is worth being known; and Nietzche, who in his own way, knew the world was false, but could not then otherwise say, as his own strenght came in seeing such faults, rather than the peace which would be brought in seeing how the world is. And now, by me at least, who in the most forward grace, settles in on the world as it is in its truly moderate ways: I am like Nitzche though, in that I must work to overcome the blockades of tradition and normality. But I know though, however, that all I am tasked to do is explain why, in our human ignorance, that the actual world which houses us does not exhibit much more than our truest claim. Of which, my toil, is in describing the realities of which our cynical view on the world may suppose; in that, if people are wrong and stupid, then so will violence, torture, destitude and crime be like this: all  the while I know, and can plainly speak, to these being the fact, as the real world produces, rather than our own wobbled view of other peoples being. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, and where I am different than Nitzche, is that this false view which I am bent to retort, comes from our own belidgerance to nature and her truth: and, particualry, to the specifics of our human life as pertains to the principles by which nature works by. And, of that, so is our increasingly prevalent place within that true view of entirety, one which knnows that the suggestion of our otherwise filly is wrong. And only do I struggle and cry, when I see the eveness of mans harsh gratuity; with the purpose of removing its vileness and putridity, and seeing otherwise as the act of men: whom I don't see with our smeared eye. And of that, I can only say, that within life, nature draws, asks, and offers plenty as we respond. But so much as we do not, and to a critically severe and superstitious degree, must we remove the cankerous view of those subjects who are invincible in their putridity, so much as our sluggish mind sees them as true. Our grace in nature holds no such view, while our insobriety to it holds a wanderous glare, of which our dispotiont to being outside nature holds its mysterioues with such gratuties. And even though the rancour of this all has washed away, so am I left with such stamps and hollows, as if wounds by our rotten sensibility. To now, where such forms are not so gratuitous and wretched, but, to my point, of their common form: whereby man, in our dearest dream, dies, kills, murders and flogs, with decent procedure and credulity. And indeed, our own fears are the root of mistaking how others act when known to be afraid."

   It seems to be that laws are only truly in place at the depths of things, and all other movements are but outputs of those. In that, we say the basis of nature is such.
   <br>&emsp;But as regards its structure, there is this primitive notion that common substances are the currators of our movments; ie. in fire and wind, sulphur and ash. And, as it stands, there is a lack of understanding for what things are, and how they are arranged. For, a enzyme, which is a complex of protein, or a pathogen, which is some sort of chemcial which your body wishes to defend against, arenot primordial substances, and at that marks of baser interaction. There is not 'pathogen' in life, but rather an arrangment of baser things which, in the form of the body, responds to the arrangment of a pathogen. In that sense, atomic occurences are but naturally mechanical, but as we'd describe through their complex ways. In the same way that phospholipids in the cell wall permitt cell malleability, and to be in placed in water (and not drowned), so is this so  by the polarity of the lipid and water, rather than some 'figurative or principal' relation between things. In the same way that the heartbeat is not an enditment on the heartbeat of nature, but rather a motion of muscle, nerves and blood. And by that, understanding such complexes (and their processes) comes down to broader developments of natures structure. For, in life's case, there were not always bones and blood; but so though the process by which physical strucutre changess [genes and evolution] so did such arrangments arise. But so are these, in principal and laudible facts, born of plantetary development, and by that the creation of the sun and its heriatge also. Life, you could say, is most notable in each arrangments due to it being like a system, whereby many parts interact; while the sun is but a densifying clump of hydrogen and heat. But so, in this, as bones are but made of bone cells, and full of genetic material, is the suns assembly made of chemcial structures with their own mechanical process. And, at that, the sun is but a cell in the nebula, or tissue rather of the galaxy. And so systems are everywhere: though life seems the furthest order.

<div id="simplylooking">
   Consider a base field, and its uneven ebbs which proport disproprtionate motion, and consqeunt interactions. This, as understood, may remark a fine theory, or understanding, as to how nature behaves. And at that, we may also, in an ontological sense, see how it cam to be, and produced the movements it did. And, to be clear, in the way that we see natures process in terms of distirbution and arranmgnet, that so would our remarks of the base field be its own description; while the theory, would remark the mechansim, or actual proportions, of how each portion moved. In that sense, the earth orbits the sun via gravity, of which we conceive as a sort of bending of space, and the earth rolls around it (via centrifugal force). But the theory of this, remarks the actual figure and metrics, of which each local motion may be a scaled version. "Gravity is so, as we understood, to be alike on Mars and Earth: while the amount merely changes." 
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, besides the notion of law and understanding, there is the foreing matter of knowledge, whereby we actually see each point, or aspect to the subejct in question, and know how they move. Descriptions remark a sort of symphany, in terms of how they all move and collasque together; while law remarks the details of each particulars motion. But knowledge, as would seemingly be divine, is a sort of sense that a conductor would have; whereby he would have an eye on the strings, horns and brass, so would a God truly, see each strand: to which, there would be no genuine law, understanding or concepts: but each moving strand. And as men, it seems, since we are not Gods, but part of the procession, that what we are best to achieve, is a grip on the laws and assembly which corresponds to that entire being. "As one simply is, in all parts of its being, doing merely so: while we are observers, from without, looking."

<div id="oddlysought">
   Our understanding of things is oddly sought. I cannot say why. I feel strongly though that it is tied to our concenr of others seeking the same; and by that, the real source are why any of us are curious at all.
   <br>&emsp;On one hand, the polytheisms of the path seem laudible in that those invovled with them, fully embrace the concpets which they subscribe to. One cannot shun their resolve. 
   <br>&emsp;But as it stands, there is a clarity in the ways that they are wrong. And as I'd put it, most things fall in this bucket; or at least hold too much ambiguity to warrant any credible sense. But there lies the issue, when others mistakenly, or with thin bravodo (as in the case of cognition) plea and proceed with a vehement certainty. By the ebbs of location and our common ways, so have all groups of people been subject to superstition, but each varying in complexion. And due to the nature of that complexion, where there is a mistaken attribtuion to something beyond us, and at absolute, so is there a strictness (and according resolve) in folks amends. And here, lies the heart of conflict, as the misplacement of those in the group with respect to that definite truth, seems only mroeso by other groups, who entirely fail to meet the domestic truth. 
   <br>&emsp;From the ground up this makes sense. Yet, for me, an individual who is not asked to do things with such condensed vehemence, what is our actual reservation in not holding the truth, or seeing others mistaken? For starters, it seems that we know little, despite our principal stake. You see, in our current state, we are alone, likely due to it once feeling like there was vehmence to do what we thought ill-founded. And truly so, of our aversion to that, was the wish for and sensibility towards, a peaceful and richer claim. "One of which held no benefit, and somtimes contrariety, to the customs proported." And so by this, our seperation leaves us somewhat concpetual in our view of things, 'as if it is the world amist I'. And from here lies the rot of sympathy, and the pedantic concerns by bare expression. This is not a clear issue though.
   <br>&emsp;What I think it is, is that unless we know the truth, then our place in the world will seem awkward, as so much in our angled content will be seen; yet for the most part indiscretely, and withotu much detail. Our solitude spurrs us to see, as does our enviroment muddy the lens with its plastic expression. But the reality is, is there is some merrit in this point; as we are indeed outside the basic norms. There is much growth to  be had in not pitting yourself against that, or being so outside that even grammar has to be remade. But, so much as we are simply uninvolved with those poor elements, so are we good to know things, as to interest our unhindered intrigue, and bolster against cheap expression. 
   <br>&emsp;Yet, at the end of it, I lie here, sitting in a sensible inquiry, wondering why we are invovled with anything at all? I can say, as one who is full questions not the nature of hunger, that our lack of occupation makes us seek, or at least wish to define, what we will be doing. "As if to ease our hopefull approach." But besides the reasons for our state, I cannot actually say I know of any real concern. And, more importantly, why there is any dispute over your current standing. Seemingly, it comes from a sort of illness from solitude, whereby your world is broader then your working self -by virute of our un-occupation. And, despite holding the principal as to why this causes stress, and its remedy, I still dont understand why we are in this position at all. Why, in our solidute, do we have such a wandering and foregin glare. Is it me? Who in fact seeks but struggles to otherwise settle? Or is it actually us who are meant to offer things, and bring forth some sort of insight for those who otherwise seemed doomed or afraid. Or is it a matter of circumstance, whereby our developments have left us with riches, but no market; and we are then not sure what to do. We humbly see the course ahead, and make some sort of intent as much as time seems to call for change. But so are we then withotu much approach, as time merely goes on, and we see only what is going to happen, but not what is. Are we outside of this ever flowing current, of which a fairer state would be a set of values and aims integrated to the motion of it; or better said, ones which come about and enact themselves with respect to our place on it? Are we trying to describe something which seems natural, outside of the basis for which such nature will work from? I cannot say why now, in our current stead, we are entirely off. Perhaps the future seems so bright, but due to the fact that more of the present is happening. And here then lies some threat of uneveness, as if our inability to be present means that a further moment will pass us by, and perhaps seems alread to have. And by that, its as if were left behind, and tugged at in our desires (for which that future holds); that, or we feel like the lives of those around are ahead, and fortunate in the clearest ways; meaning that while we are all in line, the parts of the assembly can move as they be, while we move ours; but when we are seperated, its as if we have some hollow figure of all the moving parts, as if some implicity to each and everyones ends. In short, the future getting ahead of us tears at our desire and fears, for we feel immoral, seperate, without progress. Only, that seems to be the source for their being a future at all, and not merely a extension to the current moment. At least, there seems no words for the hole which we otherwise filled, with the sense that things were wrong and we were meant to change it; upon which the future seemed to echo the voices in that hollow, and thus compell us to reach it further, if only to brace it while development could move on. Where is this hole now? I can say confidently that its source is from solitude, and the increasing sensibility that our complacent and or impressed views are wrong. Yet, beyond the mere notion of others view impacting the concern we see, why is there a concern at all? Why are we so subject to this world? Likely due to us feeling so seperate, and with a means to return, we see it as something, which by our self assured passion, or somewhat martyress profession, we see a problem ripe to fixed. Of which we angle ourselves as destined and or obliged to do so, and at that valued as much to be consquently righteous.

<div id="findinggood">
   What is the meaning of life, is more or less a question regarding purpose and technique. How can one really live, or how is one to live in manner which is full.
   <br>&emsp;Saying that something is meaningfull is a sort of postive attribution, where you are alive, or at least familiar with the according feelings, of which some thing brings. Writing is meaningfull to me because its results are postive, desirable, or simply of want. 
   <br>&emsp;The real question, is why work is not always meaningfull, even if it has a definite purpose. In such a scenario, it may be the case that the demands of the work and the reward, do not fully mathc, in that you feel like you put more effort in than its worth. That, or you simply feel like the amount of work is unneccessary: at least, you may not see that it earns you much. Which, in other words, means that work may simply cost to much for its worth, or simply lack any reason. The distinction being, that earning 1000$ dollars is fine, but may not permitt any significant purchase. At least, the work required may not feel worthwhile for what a 1000$ brings. "One may feel the same about getting 100,000$ for their arm. Or a million dollars for their mother's life." While reason, amounts to the job itself being without cause. Surely these two factors mesh, and often, but the point here is that the works neccesity is trivial. And while a modest chore may feel like formula or obligation, so is ones work a longer committment, and perhaps less meaningfull by virtue of what brought you there. It would be as if you had all the money in the world, then worked an 8 hour shift; where one side of things would see you exepmtp from an otheriwse notion where the amount that it got you was important, as your need to be there was ceratin, if only because you had nothing as is; while in this case, besides the superfluous need, so would being on the job just feel like a waste of time. "As you werent seeking benefit or enjoyment."
   At any rate, one may find that there are no real problems, and at that can act on things they find meaningfull. Chores and jobs may not be so meaningfull, in their excess or enjoyment, but so is one in need without the luxury to obstain.
   <br>&emsp;In my case, I don't feel like I need a career or profession, nor to tax myself with the according time and committment. Nor is any expected scale of my life in need of such a position, as our own local endevours have room to scale themselves to mee those expected needs. And as regards how meaningfull the work is, well, by a mix of sensibility, in seeing, or at least valuing, the more humble amount given, so am I free to participate in what I please; which itself creates a sort of updraft of ease and strenght, of which our baser means feed off. In that, work becomes more manageblae because I am happier, in both its meaning (by what it affords) and our enjoyment of it, as our thriving excess evens out our active ability and care within the actual job.
   <br>&emsp;What I find meaningfull then, on that forward front, are studies of the world and literature, industry and its particulars within writing, songs and video; games of many kinds intrigue me, casually at least, while Diablo, Battleifled, Ark and Civ hold me by their playfull hand; shows to and movies hold some attention, though the real care is one of industry; I still derive passing delights in movies like There Will Be Blood and properties like Star Trek and Lord of the Rings. Beyond this, I can say that our meaning is lacking when it comes to romance, profession, friendship and contribution. This realm though marks time outside your leisure and craft, and centers on the lands of your experience. Mine is not spent going to dinners, parties, bars, classrooms, carnivals or concerts: these are not meaningfull to me. Instead, despite our lack of company, my broader time is spent walking in the morning, evening and night, sitting on hills, fields, river sides and parks -scootering to these too- and seeing the hues, texture and expanse of the sky, clouds, sun, mountain and moon; nor do the birds singing and the trees flowing, pass by my eye. My source of worldy venture is found through books by the ancients, such as Plutarch, and memoirs, such as those by Rousseu and Robert Rogers, of which my care for the world, in those colors and views, only gets cemented as meaningfull by its kind, rather than destination. The cliffs of Gibraltor, the sunset near Bengal, or the sunrise near the Yanghtze, are but points of scenic exhibition: it is their elements which I care for though. 
   <br>&emsp;Because I recognize that this peacefull and dear existence is not so easily afforded, or endeared to by others -to the effect of opposition or isolation- I can say, by commensurability and or defense, that the timeliness, movement and assembly of the world, as it is truly, holds much wonder and meaning for me. As, our need for it to be so comes from fortuitous doubts brought upon the nievety of crowds and censors; that, or our own lingering expidtion to other things, brings with it a sort of familiartiy with the subejcts which, viewed in the crumbily common ways, leaks our ability for passion, empathy and being moral. That is, we see much of the world through our study, but have the less definite parts of it get smeared by implications or vitrol of (crowds and censors); and so, by virtue of our curious path, so does our environemtn press on us, by the aversion to its suggestion, not to ignore the truth in the matter, or remain stubborn, refutable and rancourous. 
   <br>&emsp;Why we wander is a hard thing. For do we not already know? Is it really a matter of occupation, which our development can only explain the lack thereof? 
</div>
<div id="faultofabsence">
   As a kid, you get what you want; and despite complaining, it is usually because you have to do some chores, and your pleasure is held till then. While, in your teenage years, the demands on you are akin to far development, and at that a seperation from your parents can occur. And, at that, in this seperation, certain desires and interests develop: as either a rebellious response, or ones of relief in your obligations. In that, arugments arise, as 'leave me alone, I am triyng to be me' occurs.
   <br>&emsp;My point, is that in those cases, your (more or less) ill desires are easily intruded upon, especially by those more situated. Yet, when I think of our own ordinary days, I see little which causes intrusion.
   <br>&emsp;What I am trying to inquire about, is one's wish for an absence of duty, as to then feel free and unhindered. Happiness too, is a mark of things being fine, in that we are undisturbed. 
   <br>&emsp;Where I get some confusion, is to the movtives which feel prominent when our happiness is present. Is it mere peace we seek, or the freedom to expereince what we desire? I think depression is a mark of happiness paired with no desire: for the small amount we seek is so easily undisturbed, that us being free as such makes our apparent lack of desire all the more present.
   <br>&emsp;All Im getting at is that there are so many small obstructions to our life. The idea is a little unclear, and at that, lots of money and its use for fun seem hard to compare. What we are trying wonder about is wonderous joy, and how it has so many frictions. For, be it through discpline, luck, fortune or begruderygy, so is that fun life one which affords 'things', and at that a catered experience. "Money earns one the luxury of being so catered." While joy requires one to be present themselves, and moresoe as much joy is to be expereinced. In that, we can say that joy is a choice, due to its flavor; that, or it is of neccessity, because we have no fortune. 
   <br>&emsp;The question I have asked myself, is whether it makes sense to discipline one's self to get money in order to have your experincec catered for you? Or if we should handle it ourself, and disicpline ourselves for that.
   <br>&emsp;For it being the latter means that there are so many obtrusions, mighty and small. While money, hwoever hard to acquire, has some definite means, and equally definite ends. The worth of that is hard to say, as the alternative may simply be a different kind, of which we choose. That, or we may say that fun, and its means through money, sit in life, and at that afford the fun within such domain. And that by that, wisdom, which we may see confidnelty rests on the qualitites which pertain to the whole of our life, pays according attention. And fun isnt to be divested from, nor its means. But what is to be regarded may in fact direct us elsewhere. Yet, in this all, comes that question, of joy, in its source amidst our whole lives, and how its priority, as if a well of fresh fruit compared to savoury festivities, is hard to say. 
   <br>&emsp;Maybe the highest point, and our judgement, is that joy is best pursued amidst the whole of your life, for in your address of the latter so does the means for the former come; while concerning yourself with fun, tends to ignore, and in many ways run contrary, to that whole life.

<div id="thepainofother">
   Life has always had problems, as indeed that is the core of its nature: to survive. And happiness then, or flourishing, comes when such problems are removed, or dealt with at least. But as in all things, conflict occurs in order to solve such problems; and in the case of Man, so are their frequent disputes over what problems there is. 
   <br>&emsp;A sheep acts like all others; and even if a young one held no notion of it, so would they hold no means to question and refrain. And, in many ways, that is what learning is for, in that you do what others appear to do around you.
   <br>&emsp;Man is not entirely different. Though, his particular developments lead to a sort of conduct, which albeit shared, finds a very surface level complexion which differs from those in different localles.
   <br>&emsp;Essentially, man is religious, in that he points to things which his freedom provides. But so is this process of definement, as one would more innately do upon hearing a sound behind, is not at all discretionate, or procedural. Instead, the superstitious coloring of such ways gets substantiated in all varieties of sorts, if only by the varied elements which draw such insight. Those in the tropics will have more relations with hurricanes than those in the northpole, who, uniquely, will have relations with the Aurora. And, accordingly, but the common process of idolatry, so do those elements take on such a form. 
   <br>&emsp;Beyond the vastness which Man inhabits, and at that finds other men relatively foreign, the core conflict of our times is one of soverngihty, whereby larger groups of people come into contact, and the solidified obessesion of those idols rubs against others of an equally solid kind. This is why 'savages' are referred to as so, partially do to the conduct  of their worship, but so to the 'wildness' of the idols themselves. The Romans are all to sophsitcated, and at that submitt to Mars and Apollo; while the Germans are but primitive folk who submitt to fantastical spirits and pixies. By that, lies a judgement of quality in terms of the elements worshipped. 
   <br>&emsp;Oddly though, this variation in how folks conduct themselves, has been more or less brought into union, by the advents of what universally reflects the world. Gravity is the same for those no matter the localle, nor does physics and the principals of physiology work any different. Besides the dsitcintness of a member, the mechanics of the heart generally work the same for those around the world. And by that, demonological concerns may vary from different folk, while the actual anatomy is the same. From this the world has come together; for even our nearly modern case is so as to be reaching a solidity of the unity we share in regards to our human concerns. And indeed we could make a historic point as to how the solidity of unnatural beliefs have rubbed against those natural; and at that, how, the governacne and sturucture of civiilzation being so imbuded with the cares of the former, so did the changes of such bring with much conflict as the  latter beleifs were adopted.
   <br>&emsp;But you see, here lies the question. And, as to keep from describing a narrative, but rather being kept within the scope of life, so may we say, that as an individual, our sense is such that of the world, so its conduct but a continuing process of operation, and under a evolving set of values; and that, as for us, who merely sees this as so, that so are our nearer matters, of our cares in being a member, a man, so are these continuous in their own sort, but all the while self-determined, or addressed, while the worlds conduct operates by a sort of grand assimilieis of everyones personal conduct: the whole of which, can only be described in generality: while our own steps can be addressed specifically.
</div>
<div id="ourplacesofar">
   This will be an ongoing question, of relfection, remedy and direction. But for now, I can only say that whether or not their are problems, is the actual concern in our life. If there is one, or at least something is defintiviely demanding, so is our response clear, and at that acceptbale. Its when we don't think there is a problem, but are asked to act otherwise. This is why people (who do) care not for the church, or find themselves frustrated with it; as is the same for those in acadamia. And for me, our parents act as though college is essential, but I never know why. They never tell me; and at least the fact of it being a means for a house and car is never substantiated against some broader meaning in life. Besides the lack of clarity, being critical about the matter does not hold it up. Which itself brings the question of value; for as a kid, my reservation in doing ceratin things was because it felt stupid; and indeed I did not always understand; but even as I did, in baser things, so did I not actually agree with them, or find much value rather.
   <br>&emsp;And in that case, my whole life has been a sort of  complaceny to norms I did not care for or respect; but upon holding no success there, I developed my own; which itself came against those who valued otherwise. And even now, as I am accepted, so has time brought us away from much success in our current place. At least, the values themselves are in question; for their basic standing is that there are loose threads in your heart and mind, and at that, in need of attention. The results are valuable to me, but so do we live, and evalute things with respect to this, as if we are amidst such problems. And this has not fostered any friendship, equity or praise. Which, again, I am not discontent to, as my dealings are not but pleasing. I am only beginning to think that of such values, that their proportions are somewhat off, and in need of refinenment. For, indeed eating well is crucial, and neccessary or not, I prefer it. At least I enjoy what it offers, and rest happily on it being somewhat unebcoming to ignore. But so does this not require an abscence from those who act otherwise. And indeed, my discontent comes from a sort of judgment on my part, a cynicism if you will, in that, our view that others care not for these important things, erodes itself into thinking that they are opposed, while it really is just a matter of me being unable to be so different. Our values are hard to explain; as their motivations come from truly different principals. But so is the need for certain things not essential, in that, our genuine care for sobriety is in the wonder it brings; rather than it being itself essential. And amdist ohters, no matter their ways, so can I accordingly be. But this disconnect, be it by our lack of clarity and thus confidence, or some mixture of antagonism, uninterest or bravdo (by others), so do I get defensive, self assured and critical:  as if my unstable position demands me to refute: and due to our somewhat reputable principal, I see them as lesser, foolish, futile. When in fact, the truth is that I really don't know myself.

   I have no princiapl aversion to abortion, the same way I have no principal aversion to pest control. I only rely on the fact, that so much as judgement is involved, and our discretion is to be deemed appropraite, that we would have some knowledge and sense as regards the notion of 'its murder', and the strenght and weaknesses of seeing this as or not so: which is to say, that we should understand the situation as a subject itself, to which we then layer upon the concerns of peoples right to act accordingly.
   <br>&emsp;At that, I would not, if given a child, turn to abortion -assuming a lack of interest in the child. At least, in practice, if I had a child now, my preference would not lead me that way, but based on that, rather than a lack of options. But so, in terms of predictions, and the values which are to be fostered to those coming forth, so is it explciit that a child (and thus one's chidlren) are not to be raised outside of other's company; meaning that, home schooling is not sufficient less there are sufficeint social compliments. I simply think that this is wrong, and not something I would administer, nor encourage to friends or a child of my own. At that, comes the common notion of, 'well I wouldn't want to raise my child in a world like this'; which in its own right seems overly pessmistic and non critical. But the point, is that in regards to preference, so may I adjust per sufficicencies need: meaning that one is compramisable while the other is not. In terms of that preference, mine lies deeply within education, and the lack of profit found in public grade school. Post-Secondary seems to hold values and practices which reflect the truer process and fertility of learning, but so is this expereince later in life: and is not some leisurely action, but one of investment; the worht of which, I can only say is beyond sufficiency; at  least, it remarks a supposed need (by the means it fosters) for a state of sufficeincy which can only be decribed as 'not frugal'. And althought the source for joy as a motive is unclear, so can I only say that 'applying yourself professionaly', and for the sake finances, is not so purely on the basis of 'there being nothing else'; or in other words, that life, to me, is not so linear and homogneous, that being poor is defintiively worse than being wealthy; as such properties are not so essential to the various aspects of life which are in significant beyond the results of money. By that, my preference for myself and those who I'd foster, is not to apply themselves souly, or at least with any sense of neccsity or essential worth, to such finances, and thus to through the means which are primarily catered for that. This is where theres conflict between sufficeincy and preference; as school provides the company one needs, but lacks the richness that we'd prefer. In that, I only mean to say, that in terms of our election to have a child, so do I rest on such preference as much as our circumstance provides. For things happen; and, depending on the scenario, that terminaton or adoption may not be as preferable as sending your kid to public school. I can only say, that in having such preference, and amidst the somewhat unordinary outcome of becoming pregnant outside election or being unprotective, that I can remain as such sensible, to remain as austere as I please; while my preferences find a time which seems desirable. Suffiency is a mere quality of the possible outcome, in that our preference is not so easily met, in that our wish for a richer rearing is not appropriate unless social aspects are included. And, as a broader disclaimer, that having a child at all is not something which warrants tradition's respect, but rather has to do with one's qualified and preferred interest. Which, I own up to in terms of being so particular, and integral at that (as not to inapprotialy get what I seek); and at that, admitt our pleasure prior to such circumstances, where a fair and true outcome was possible. "Upon reflection, this is ok, as the preferences to do with me personally are still highly emphasized; to which the lack of child is not so overwhelming, or entirely eligble -as such a situation would require its own dedication. By which, I am so to me, and happily -for ends at least which are different than having a child."

<div id="groovesoferror">
   There are two cares I have in this world: what things are, and what they mean. This is not to be confused with how things are, as per our understanding of what something is, so is its purpose and motion but a property of its identity; at least so much as I describe it.
   <br>&emsp;By that, I both trust and respec the physicists and chemists who have found the true workings of the world. And as an ordinary man, my goal is to firstly see such findings, 'as one may do upon a meteroligists insights, whereby they ascertain what is suggested'; and then, consider such ways (or truth rather). 
   <br>&emsp;This last part is a difficult part, for it may feel like we are intruding upon the insights to the world's ways. But this is more personal, or at least more human, in that of the facts regarding atoms and planets, so do I understand and compose myself according;y; equally as those who adhered to the fact of god and demons. But just as the impression of a disaster may elicit a feeling of divine power, so is it in one's judgmenet, or the earnings from a preacher, to conclude what such occurences mean. The divinity is but a truth to the mystery at hand, in the same way that mass warping space is the cause within the orbits we observe. But what such orbits mean, at least, what such events born about and conducted by said truth, to which we particularly amend, or simply conflate with the event in question, bears our crucial regard. 
   <br>&emsp;What I have is a loose scenery of which I can draw examples which can show that ordinary actions are akin to science; and by that, show that our inquries and conclusions are themselves scientific; or are at  least to due with mysteries whcih hold a definite anwser based on our understanding. For one, being procedural, critical, unbiased or heuristic, and, in short, holding the reliablity of your concluisions via the merritably according means, is something which remarks everyday occurences, from our plans to travel and the assumptions that follows, to our accouting of funds and the fidelity to such figures. And by that, I would say, that as we observe a system, and the entire system at that, that so may we ultimatley concenr ourselve with the system of our lives. For, locally, our sun causes the orbit of the earth via gravity; and so to the planets around Alpha centauri. But these systems are in a way derived, in the way that a puddle may cause droplets to spread about, but are but progressive arrangments of that starting body. And my point, is that as all things are more or less universal, and at that guided by the deepest principal (or real process), that so, when we observe things of an ostensible sort, or piece of that universal arrangment, that so are our lives equally a subject.
   <br>&emsp;Now, when asking this question, 'in terms of the world, what does it, with respect to me, mean', some critical sensibility is required. For you must, or ought to at least, presume that you are but an assembly of the whole, a branch of the universal fabric; and at that are an object arranged under the constituent and operating forces, of which the sun, earth and moon are equal. "Them and us are all ebbs within an entire flow." And from this, we must pivot our thinking on the meager point of continuity; which, in princiapl, cares not how the world came to be, and thorugh which sort of manner; rather, we simply care about, as to what was made, and the procession of it all, from back, so far and in process, and whether this is continous or not. Meaning, that if it is continous, then there has never been, nor can there be, in fact or plausibility, and suspenion of reality, 'or the flow' so to speak; and, at that, through our own case, any mircales or similar feats. 
   <br>&emsp;The grundge of this all comes from a comparable problem to science and physics, in that they only define, but meagerly evaluate. And just as that base question of natures continuity is not so ardently proported or claimed, so, in our own matter, is the nature of 'mind' ambiguous, in the sense that of the elements and or aspects which such a term remarks, so are these but factually understood, but through the meagerest descriptive lens. For one, the notion of a thought is not so clear, in that of what we are referring to we only commonly know. That tune in your head, is it there, a real sound, an illusion: what exactly is it. And, from there, comes the fact that, as words are really syllables, and vision is really a compinsation of granular inputs of light, that so are our thoughts equally diffuse in nature, yet, as we see compositionally, so in that way do we think. And this is not a fair measure of thought, or whatever that occurence is. In the same sense, that as a body, we are but tissue, and at that molecular. And besides the words and feelings we actually have, that just as digestion is a process of enzymes and nutrients -rather than food and our tummy- that so is our cognition, however sprung, of a portioned nature: rather than such terms and precision being fully one. As Hume said, your remark of things, be it the properties of an egg, or your inner self, are only done so through the tools at your disposal: which are themselves not understood besides those tools. And if such tools are of a non-composite nauture, besides the concieved form, that so are the means for identifying it (thoughts) or things around us, known accordingly. "In that the granules of our vision can only know the inputs via such granularity." And what seems the most fair to presume, is that as we are granular, or but assmeblies in function and form, that so are others the same: despite our means to knowing this being equally portioned. 
   <br>&emsp;The point, is that as the world, made by God or not but governed nonetheless continouslly, that so are we, in body and sense (a better term for mind) equally composite, or assembled rather, of those weavings of the worlds strands. As there is indeed, via atomic theory (in the real and principal sense -via Democritus) merely atoms, or at least pieces which correspond to that. And as such, cognition, behaviour, recognition, dreams and desire, are but motions of nature's assembly. And, in terms of knowledge, the order of systems are understood with as much complexity as we can acquaint ourselves with. Which is why, we know so little realtively spaeking about ourselves, 'as we are the ones who must personally know': and none follow the effective course of this action, 'know thyself'. No matter, if we understood the constiunecy of nature and her complexion, of which here operations would produce, and at that to an assembly which marked that process about her details and complexion, then so could we see, as we in fact do, that energy came, cooled, formed, distributed, clumped, and like moss on a tree, sprouted life, squirells and us.
   <br>&emsp;Indeed this line of reasoning can go forever, as each slice of the process can be explored. And there are means to assess things on a relevantly local scale -as not to cite the birth of all things in order to speak of something specific.  But then, ultimately, we come to ourselves, and the motivations whhich cause us to concern us with the meaning of all this. And all I would say, is that, whether you fully understand fire and the motor mechanics of your hand, that 'the meaning' of all this, must not be ascertained while your skin is on the flame. Nature, via her continuity, has already sprouted you to be, so do so. And, as I find at least, part of behaviour includes this act of relfection, and at that regards for things outside our immedaite gaze. Regardless of the moments between, we can say, that of such moments they are easily expereinced, or a draw as to 'why must we experince pain, what is it for'. And of that, so is 'that', or it, our lifes of which you are asking the meaning of, that so, in truth, is our birth and death a definition of such thing: and notably then, or commonly rather, the real question of these kinds center on that latter fact, no matter the base of encouramgnet (from pain, causing you to see life and its status, and thus its end). And of that, I would say, that in order to consul that which spurrs you to ask, that understanding the truth at hand will better allow you to address what living means. For the fact of the matter is, on the basis of continuous arrangment, that so are you, in heritage and name, a current in the entire flow: and like a rock, by nature's wind [the basis for death] whithered away. Surely the status of our so called mind comes into question, but so by our admittence is such a thing but a part of the figure. "And indeed the primitve status of our view is one of actually understaning what sense is: how chemistry creates experinece." But no matter, for authority and our reputable sense attenutest ourselves to this, and by that, bears the fair remark that of such mind, that so, in its normal processes, will simply proceed as they do, changing from the course of the form which produced expereince, to a state of the form (in dissamebly namely) that releases experience. 
   <br>&emsp;And where man has failed is in this pointed conclusion, whereby such release is both assessed, and accordingly offered as the matter of counsel, that the mind continues, or expereince rather remains. But, as I can at least say by the proportinate state of real living, that such motions produce in it a comparable (if only) expereince to that which is most equitably defined in our dissamevbly upon death: and that, simply, is rest, and all the peace and tranquility with our needing heart delights: in counsel at least. "But such poetry, wisdom and time, is more or less fair, when picture being colored is one of truth: the fact being, that the figures in question do in fact hold no hue: but that is what art is for, to give such form some vibrance. And by my belief, our need in life is to understand such form, and hold an integrity of conquest which is reputably so, as much as the view of that form is made, and contained. But so, in our heart, and progress and men, can we give such accuracy some color and flair: for who ever created evil from softening the truth? By my accounts, it has been those trying to polish what has, to date, been shown as false: no wonder the limitless counts of equal mistakneess, and conflict produced."
</div>
<div id="coursetoact">
   So the first place to start is the preface, in that, as me, we already are, in that our being is motion amidst this reflective process. By that, our motions are continuous, akin to nature as a whole. And from this, our regards centre on objects relevant to this flow. 
   <br>&emsp;Namely, as our history suggests, is there a problem, and if so, of what kind; meaning one of immediacy, something to fix, or some far off concern, such as a future move, or your late life in general. Obviously, as the farther things go, the less apparent they become: and clearly, a Tiger racing towards you holds all your attention, compared even to some test tomorrow. 
   <br>&emsp;What is important to note is that one may still find lingering threats, or weariness rather, upon those farther (and diffuse) issues. And this is likely so if the present is unoccupied. For the abscence of tigers or any momentary problem (or one that is nearby and definite) will still have one see what lies beyond that, if they are doing nothing right now.
   <br>&emsp;Now, sensibility ought guide us, for actions, to our benefit and need, will accomulate and bear future effects; and through this, so ought we be discriminate to the path and choices we take. But our life is neverthless lived in action. The far off concerns are themselves actions, but of a contrsictive sort. And from that, if there are no tigers, nor any problems to fix, then your general occupation may proceed. Whether that be with respect to something long term, and a step required, or the mere pleasure of being unhindered, and all the according delights which draw your easi'd mind. 
   <br>&emsp;To me, on the whole of it, this is sound as a scale for our life's fashion. And by that, all that seems to be worth remarking is whether there are tigers, problems, lingering debts and fixes, or some abscence of action which our forthought would otherwise suggest.
   <br>&emsp;In that case, we have three sorts of acts. Ones which deliberate the basis for the values and according actions which our future suggests; current actions which are beyond reaction, but of draw, in that your liberty is at your disposal; and, through modernity, a sensible relation of the two, in that our regards for those future cares and aims, ought hold some measure to how we spend our otherwise free time. As liberty may not be so delightfull, but indulgent or rancorous instead. And indeed these go against most actions which are deemed fit for our future regard. Moreover, one will discover that the future truly holds warranted remarks, and as such, so are there qualities to our liberty (or our time within it) which are preferable.  For, indeed, one may, upon a free feeling, indulge themselves and exhuberntly act. But so do such strides go against the currents which will carry you to those future regards. Such regards are not so demanding in terms of what you ought construct, but rather that your ordinary composure and civil progression ought be frugal, in check, rich in liberty rather than passion; and as such, so do the favored qualities of such liberty (or free time) come to be. 
</div>
<div id="lightandhearty">
   I can say then, in general, that what your future ought to hold is hard to say. On one hand, the ends of it are undetermined, though to an increasingly smaller degree. But more practically, comes down to notions of houses, finances and bucketlists. For me, sufficiency will always hold us above water, as will any person compare; to which our offspring will be. At that proficiency is a sort of investment, in terms of oppertunity offering you the means to leverage your skills, as to earn higher kinds of pleasure. It is not so defined, but most pleasurs of this sort are occasional, and desired mostly due to their concentrated effects. But, per our life and its drawn out course, so do moments, or expereinces rather, not fit the bill. For it is the constant point of expereinces which makes our life so, and at that, it is the complexion amongst the whole of them which bears us a true state of living, rather than from one special moment.
   <br>&emsp;Besides this, I can at least say, that what we require is little. And, personally, being outside anothers will is quite calming, and liberating for me to do as I please. In that sense, I am paying soul attnetion to the stretch ahead, for that is all I am keen enough to see. All which lies beyond is not essential, and, by sound accounts, sought after based on current dis-ease. "And regarding oppertunity, know that the present always keeps up; and that the approach is more likely the pleasure, while the moment of joy simply passes away: as more potential moments come about." 
   <br>&emsp;At that, I can see that our time is without much strain, notably because we are not holding onto things held by another. By that, we can live as our needs require, but not much more. Indeed, at home or on our own, and amidst whichever itnierary, there are things for me to do. But yearning for, and acting for such things beyond this tend to keep me in suspense, as if some judgement is to be passed. This isn't to say that college, buinsess, creativity or contribution can't be assessed and aimed at. But, with the values that come from your current steadiness, and such aims are but calm extensions 'of one already pleased, and naturally drawn to proceed more', so do we go. 
   <br>&emsp;In that, our liberty is in need of fashioning, as the sights which spark our interest are not so clearly defined. At least, concerning this are our occupation, in that it is what we effectivley do, that so as bearing wains, do we teater it back. 
   <br>&emsp;For methodicals sake, we can split these remarks into entertainment, leisure and study. Responsability is in itself contained, and at that evened out by our real committments -and not those which we year for and or struggle to address. As a quick mark, our exercise is in a principaled state, and really just needs occasioanl reminders as to its content; as we are always going to do something, and indeed the weakness of our schemes ought be addressed; but so is there strenght not always paired with clarity, of our coming days plan that is. And so some itineric remarks hold that -and I can say that in terms of the principal so are they strong. of which food also applies. 
   <br>&emsp;Entertainment  wise we have just finsihed the first season of the Next Generation. I had prior to that finsihed the prequels, and mean to watch the OT. Giving some time to reset for season 2 will correspond with that viewing. Video wise we are primarily watching 2013, and moving ahead as the chronology suggests. "I need not watch ever sessler or patcher; as these were novel in terms of there place amidst the prior year, where all was absent." And so finsihing the year will lead us into GT, which I am looking forward to. Diablo wise, videos are coming out, though my rampant interest is not so ripe. With respect to the game, I am more or less pleased with the season so far. Some of the mechanics and their pairing with our skill level and insight, makes it so the Ubers can't be attempted. But, by our main, and our general levelling and scaling pricniples, we do have the means to play some harder content, and farm at that. The expansion comes out in like 2 months, and along with Civ, information will be coming out at Gamescome this following week. Besides that, Ark was wonderful, and our settings have made working through the lands both engaging and meaingfull. I feel like I could return to our world and continue playing; namely getting our airforce, some wolves, griffins and wyvers, and just playing ovearll. Justin mentioned he wanted to play, so that might mark our return. And as regards shooters, Battlefield holds the mark. I had played for some time, and tried new weapons and was just generally on top of it. Ark and Diablo have brought me away, and concerning our future return, I see some potential fun with BF4, and possibly battlefront. Besides that there is Gran Turisom, Dragon's Dogma, Harry Potter and Dying light which hold my next gen interest. Astro Bot too is coming next month; though, like those others, full price is a hard ask. 
   <br>&emsp;Regarding studies, my life is keeping such things kept. For the whole year we've been reading, and moreso since we got our tablet. And little notions have come from this, in making sense of terms, the place of drama, our acquaintence with violence and older times. From this, there are many more things I'd like to do, as if there were moulds in our mind ready to fill. But indeed, part of our life is very bare, in that we are not much invovled recreationally, and at that trodding along through varieties of activity. This used to make me worn, while now our evened pace still sees some trepdation at the fact that our course of things (at hand at least) are to do almsot entirely with that. It is true that our liberty to be complacent and or at rest is increased as much as our actual life is obliged to -as opposed to forcing another's hand- but so is the pressure to resort to bungledness unless we keep trodding, and through such suitable means, holds our care for study in suspense. As such care is a mixture of real and genuine curisoity, the emphasis placed on our feeling absent from the world, or at least the waivering feelings which make the enviroment feel contrived, argumentaive and grim, all born from us somewhat loosing ourselves; or at least the balance of our solitude paired with our means to be so vibrantly; which, to be clear, gets weighed down due to our nieve forsight, and the consquent fear of scrutiny and contempt in being unactive or at rest. So sensibility does in fact lighten the core of which we may merrily be. And, in that, principals keep us afloat, even if there is not much matter around it. At any rate, our care for reading and writing is such as to form myself; but as I said, this care to assimilate is not purely from curiosity, but reserve and rancour. It is possible, and such a point is favorable in that we are rightly convinced, that such grievings are from the abscence of knowledge which we find to be the mark of our need. And better moments act then as both a source for such marks, or extend what those concerns drawn upon us. In that, my care is for men; not entirely there motions and words, but rather who they are as people, in both custom and chronology. Aristotle strikes me as a key figure who I have too little acquaintence; and Plato also. Seneca, Socrates, Plutarch and Epictetus are like fathers to me, yet I know not much more about them than their sensibility. And at that, our idea of their homes and times is but an extension of our familarity with their words, but not the actual complexion of such localles. Greece and Rome would rightly broaden from this, and at that offer more ample grounds for Babylon and the Gauls to be known. Modern folk sit here also, in Descartes, Hume, Nieztche and the many scientists and mathemmiticnas through the centuries. Artists too follow this line. Theres just something about knowing who a person is, that you get a sense of the rest of the world. Which in many ways reflects the relief which our cankerous curisoities bank upon. Upon that, lies our general studies. But all the while the histroy of things is rich, so are our actual sights on what things there are, and they be, is shallow. And I would say, that certain things here fit into a sort of basic care for understanding, as a device we'll say; while others, such as cameras or computers, hold my concerns in terms of the actual process, or expereince created upon some mysterious function. How does the image from a video come to be, or the audio from a microphone create what is being globally sent. How are stars observed, and fossils known. And at that, what has been most basically identified. I care little for the elements, but nature's components. I.E. the standard model. Which, alongside this, holds the motion of light, the nature of sound and heat. And bordering all of this, in that such a model is the core of nature, that so are we, as inquiries, our own core subject, fully of which, our deepest draw is to the nature of expereince; which, beyond the questioning of how expereince occurs, so is the operations and assembly of vision, memory and hearing most notable. All of these things can, and ought be, procurred, through a organization of interent archive books, where essay/treatise introductions can be catalogued, or biographies at that regarding modern people (or non writers); and the matters of cameras, hadrons and light, can all be discerned through wikipedia. In a perfect world we could read about these things casually, but our actual interest seem more focused, in that our concerns are particular. We care not about physics, just as we care not for literal history; there are only certain, if not specific elements which we wish to acquiesce. By that, an immediate approach regarding cameras, radio, video, computers, internet, light, sound, standard model, sight, hearing, memory, smell, spectroscopy and carbon dating, can all occur via there mere stake of being summarily defined and spokem about. "For my true care is to only paint a better picutre: and these things are but murky, if not, loosely stationed shapes in our repitoire." And as regards biographies, so is this something which you can in fact read. Sorting those out is a sort of library, or 'network': and surely some relevant, if not additional literay readings (such as rhetoric or poetics, or vaired additions of Plutarc or Montainge) can be joined to that.
</div>
<div id="noteofextent">
   I'm led to believe that people desire news. The roots perhaps, are in the natural mystery of the world, and the value thus of hearing anything about it. That, and the prevalence of this fact means that, being current, means your in the know, and thus able to share, and at that be one to recieve.
   <br>&emsp;But the world does not operate so singly, and the news we remark about is usually regarding matters besides the consquent behaviour of us sharing the news. And of that, so would information remark what is actullay going on in the world. The news may better describe current events, but world's status, or composure rather, is to do with information. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, we have electives, administrators, law makers, policies, those in question, already refuted, metrics for race, sex, income, and those of the economy and other divisions of the country: these remark the susbtance of life, ours at least. 
   <br>&emsp;The news is not an analog for this. Rather, people act, or things do at least. And be it the words and or decisions of a judge, or the accidents between to folk who've crashed their cars, so is the news a digestion of the actions of the world.
   <br>&emsp;I won't jump the gun and say there's a problem. For theres an important note of extent, in terms of what occurs in one's city, region, country and the globe. Each of these sections have their corresponding substance, and occurences at that. For me, the perril, and or saturation which actions bring, is less so the smaller the scale. For if there is a foolish official in my city, so am I aware of other cities around me, and our province at that. Even if our town was rot with distrust and agony, so would the world still lie around us. And because we are effiecitlvy aware of the world, in England and India per say, so is the extent of our lives as such. "One's floor may be leaking, but the stove still works: and our house still feels operational."
   <br>&emsp;The problem though, is that as you become aware of the world composure, you realize, that it is a bunch of towns, grouped into regions, pooled into nations and continents, all packed together into the planet. And as our town has a mayor, service people, doctors, restraunts, traffic laws and such, so do all others. Although hearing about one of these bears remarks as to our own localle, so is a similar remark of a town across the world, but a low res image of some object far away. To be fair, my criticism is not on the reliablity or detail of such a foregin story. I only mean, that as the scope of your knowledge increases, so are you suscpetible to sink in your depth integrity; in that, of some town or province far away, you may pretend like its right next to your, or surrounding you at that; when in fact, it is but a puzzle piece far away surrounded by other pieces. And to me, this remarks a weakness of information, in that of our insights to things, so are we un-circumspect.
   <br>&emsp;From this, I can only confess that the world seems fine; as I don't know enough to know what is going on across the fragments of its board; nor do I attempt to know, as that is like knowing every element, bone, local star cluster and premiere league roster. But, despite this senisiblity for our own cares regarding things, which I can say is fashioned by books and experience, it is alarming to me when such sensibilities wain due to our active composure, with the consquence that the 'news' brought to other folk seems too intruiging or intrusive. This is so, for I know that the incident their remarking holds little in terms of prevalence amongst the scope of the area regarded. That, and the condensed minutia of the scenario is not even a robust expression of the act at hand. And so I am left in this space where, if I am knowledgeble, or at least with respect, to the real scope of the world, and at that eased by our confession to this, 'as to settle into our ignorance', so am I fine with others who are not so privy wishing for a sense of the world. Only, when our integrity of depth wains, all while our memory and dispotion stay, so do others remarking about some far off country (with no integrity of depth) befuddle me. For in some sense I believe their wrong. Truly though, our lack of steadyness makes what their saying appear as if it is being conveyed, and listened to, with both more brevity and assurance than their really is, nor is any real belief regarding the world managed. In fact, my feeling is that the majority of people who concern themselves with how other people behave, are those who watch the news, and only have a sense of how peopel act, from that. I dispostion to the real beholds me to others watching the news, but stationed in the world. One never misses work because of the news, nor do they avoid their daily routine. There vote is all that counts; and indeed, our own impression of this and similar conducts, is from our more familiar (all be it second hand and overhead) impression from online outlets. 
   <br>&emsp;Understadning this is important. As, one seeks the news for they feel postively invovled, but also ceased of negativity in their unsure sense of the world, that so, of this, if the broader world is invovled, but with no integrity of depth, so does such 'learning' feel like awkward obssession, and at that a supsicious sign of misaligned action. Thats the prolblem, souly. Not that Russia is acting like this, or some public offical like that, but that people would believe this in its entirety: as if thats all their really were. I'd point though to twitter, or youtube shorts, videos in general, and how watching some of these can get you in a bungled state, whereby your responding, over confident, and irrate. This is no welcomed or reliable state to offer or recieve judgements about the world. "You become like someone screaming 'the sky is falling', while everyone else is walking past with derision, proceeding through their ordinary lives." The newspaper used to faciliate what people would talk about as they went through the world; but now, the media are more like magazines, in that you heed it while sitting at home, on your computer, while watching dinner. And its not really information regarding the state of taxes in Britain, rather some quote of what someone said, some accient on 23rd street, some grandstanding statement regarding 'the democracy in our country'. These are conjectural, minute, professionally assured, and off putting for someone like me who finds a real concern about the world. Thats why they call it the integrity of depth.
   <br>&emsp;I live with our parents, and they are indeed like old folk who read a book while the news is on in the background. My experiece though is that books and expereeince are the real measure of the world: at least, of what the world is and the care to conceive it, so are televisions and digital screens a poor choice. You just scroll, or hear, but never fully recieve; as your brain naturally thinks, or arranges words and ideas, which is what reading and expereince give. Those other forms give stories, enactments, spotlights. But their not in themselves usually critical: nor fostering of you being so. And I must rely on this sensibility of good, in the same way that having a boggy conversation about poltiics is not in itself a world changing or self-worthy event, that so are real impressions, thinking, and, namely, reproach to the mass of the world, but the real fosterings of anything worthwhile, and representative at that. Just the suggestivness of the news, which is aparrent in some cases and only mildly in others, is but a film, a tabloid, a tweet, a post. Theres no words being conveyed though, but imagary, conlusions, an advocate statement. But one must remember that people don't A) simply watch T.V, and B) the news while they are. People watch dramas, reality TV, various news outlets from other sources, sports, entertainment; nor are they unoccopuied by work, eating, their own recreation. Sleep even. Perhaps its this adolsecent gratuity, whereby you are sensible enough to be composed and able, yet overstepped and ideal: not having yet sunk in, and being humbly privy to the whole world, rather than the 'news' which urks you. 
   <br>&emsp;I don't know what to say. My own feeling, which is something that has troubled me for years, is that, having not been privy to the news, and being somewhat well read, never led me to believe that any problems or narrative which the media epxressed was laudible. But that is perhaps the point, that just as folk wish for news, bit from other people, the paper, radio, or broadcast, that so do we, in our abscence of news, despite the sensibility of the world being innately fine, that so do we linger on the plausibility of this fact: for we are in fact not hearing whats going on. And indeed, events come to us by others merely passing by. And our own actions are not always pure in terms of media intake. This is like our sexuality being somewhat frugal, and despite finely, and a consequence of something which is itslef not a perril, so does porn ratchet up our feelings about this, and either make us feel better about the 'image' being seen, but then unhappy with the reality of the situation; the problem being that the reality of the situation is warped by the direction that the porn has brought you. We are fine as is, but upon watching porn, our interests become such, and our reality is not so. And I don't need a pornstar girlfriend, but one at all? This is like watching nice cars, and being disparaged at not having one: when before seeing the former, you held not attention or care for the latter. 
   <br>&emsp;So there is this point about yoour own intake of the news, be it from your own choice, or via second hand. But so is that but waining on what you have no means to otherwise know. For it is but a homely privialge not to here about, or browse towards, some 'portrayed' view of the world. And by that, our sense that something is going on becomes warped. And, like the natural care for news, we feel like others are hip, benefiting from that, or are at least apart of some problem while I am not. Which indeed gives me some awryiness about the issue, as our abscence makes us feel vulnerable, and helpless to change it. Which makes our commrades feel at risk to. Knowledge removes our disposal to this though, and at that, our predilcations are that the world is fine. Through wars even and all that which only our ignorance paints grim. But this concpetion naturally gets waivered, as your 'news' intake is a struggle to avoid. In our current scenario at least. But just as one who is disposed to the world in a problesome way, feels left out and weary at not knowing, so is the flame of our dispostion overwhlemed by a similar concenr, when such emebrs are not so bright. "It is like Gandalf pressuring back Sauron." 
   <br>&emsp;There lies the question, as to whether expereince and reading can ease our steps through life, as the extent of the world mnutely proceeds. Or, as such peace is thwarted, or poked at, that we deal with the throbbing but A) understanding the poke, as to understand it like one woudl with a joke, or B) strenghten our disposition as to be massive itself, and at that less moveable. Paired with that, are our choices; for if we watch crabby youtube videos, than our emotions are excitred; which only makes the more mundane impressionos from our home more unsettling. And, at that, our composure isnt shifted or irkedly sprung: to which our everyday talk can remain limber and upright: all while our real expereince with the world (outside the yammering) is a confident one: as our repor with reason and living, bears truth to ourselves: which in lack, is the soul cause of us feeling off about the views of others. "For their words, however known, may be believe true."

   I don’t care for the news, despite its good intent, for the criticisms and ideals which it presents seem too bare to match the enormity of the world. Locally, I see some merit; but it is not uncommon for ‘local’ to equate to several million people, and at that many large towns. “Not even a neighbourhood is the metric for constituent pieces, but towns themselves -but are they so small?”
   <br>&emsp;And the question then comes to virtue, in that we, as people within a community, have some sort of obligation to each other. That, and as the scale of such community broadens, so do our duties extend. For if we are truly people of the world, and at that one with all on earth, then so do we have virtues of the sort.
   <br>&emsp;The problem though is one of excess. For the purpose of society, whole and small, is to produce what each individual can offer at an excessive degree. “We all put something in, and more than what we could do alone come’s out.” And indeed this is how society has functioned for a millennia. That, and the notion of collective virtue has been around almost as long: for the virtues which co-operation supports, need virtues which organize such support. Both in terms of ample and opportune employment (of each member), and the distribution of each members contribution. Moreover, the act of determination and execution of such organization becomes a role in itself; which has virtues of its own. 
   <br>&emsp;It is worth noting too, that the virtues of each member is in part within their unified nature within a collective; so that those who are hunters would hunt with the collective in mind, while those who governed would do so with their purpose (as governors) in mind. 
   <br>&emsp;In that, we say that collective virtue is defined within the general realm of communal structure, and  each members subjection to it. “So that they may not fret about the excess which they’d otherwise have, being sent evenly to others around. Each member ought have eachother in mind.”

   When there seomthing stressfull upcoming, you kinda sit and relax in reservation, as your mind cant let go of the thing upcoming. When your free, you can act accordingly. 
   <br>&emsp;But there is this problem when there is something known far ahead, but nothing near at hand. In that former sense, I see we are moving; and life will remain, but from those newer grounds. Likely similar, but still ahead, and prone to promise by virtue of it being in the future.
   <br>&emsp;Now then, I am free, without work or anything of the sort. Nor do we yearn for, or clammer against, the course of our life; and at that, hold no suspense over our preferences coming true, nor any fear of others holding my attnetion, as I seek something from them. Theres just no threat.
   <br>&emsp;Because of that, I kinda settle, pleasingly, but also unsuredly. On one hand, our natural care is really our health, and all other things, however unacuqinated with such state, are there to be finely and openly. There are not other needs and desires, while our health feels important. This morning, we intended to workout, but were active prior, and my energy was drained. Normally I don't appreciate our health so much, as our supposed place in the world is such that acitivties help us cope. But there is nothing to cope, and such acitvites have all the room to comfortably be. And so, this urge of yours, in disicpline and claim, can prioitize itself, withotu any distress about having nothing left for those other interests. For we have no friction in being alright with not, simply being as our duty is done; and normally, our itnerests hold enough sway as not to allow that; but their there to swirm around without impingment, and can be with us as we please. This is great.
   <br>&emsp;Another thing is that our moral line of the world feels astray, if only our peace is intruded upon by loud assertions. I must addmit that reporting is different than judgement, and indeed there are elements of the former which I like. But the latter elements make the world feel small, dissproportionate, and doomed to an end which is not critically determined. In that, I am urged to be more with the world, if only in sense, as not to be so overwhelemed.
   <br>&emsp;And indeed this is our state, in that of the currents of time, so do we, civilly, let them be, as there are millions of others, grouped, ordained, subject or in control, by many peculiarities and hues, around me. I may be ignorant and negligent, but the world is not simply over there, while we are here, complaining about it or ignoring it. Its more complex than that. Nor, is man's resolve limited; and the mystery of the future should be somewhat reassured under the appearence of that resolve, in that it is so entire. That indeed is a sturdy position, in that your place is not in fact so immoral, in being at rest, when the world is so large. Perhaps our peace  is more burdened, than situated. And I think that, albeit fair to a degree in the disturbance, 'as one cannot help but be sprung by the slightest glimpse at porn', that our inability to look past this slight scratch, and not be so deterred by the fact it is present (as opposed to there being an actual stain), as such as to remark me: which indeed, comes from actions which, although fufilling, bear myself with a pace that does not accomdate for more prudent matters. "Perhaps in part due to such interests being there as a balance to our inability for peace, which itself comes from our over-disturbance from things, which however poor in nature, are not in fact so substantial in your impression of them. Like reality tv, opinion pieces, or thrilling television, so  is the news the same, in that it holds no bar above you." Perhaps were empty somewhat, and at that tense in our approach to write off or build up, to counter/repute. But maybe our lesson should be formed through time, as to look past the tiniest disturbance, and hold yourself rightly accountable to the peace which your maturity offers. And the knoweldge which is collected down the line of that. "So one may dance a little, or be uprigt amidst the media/bravose pinches: and through consistency, a mistiness to such hits. Where we may be."

<div id="merelyoff">
   Remarking upon the systems of the world holds the largest trouble when it comes to deciding one's resolve. For we may see trouble in the culture, and our according sensibilities, and at that, hold some angst at getting our remedy known. Now, while this wish may be colored with passion, so is its aim a fair one, or just rather. The struggle though, is that our care for this coming to fruition, holds with it a sort of humility in terms of the need of it, and by that our duty to provide. As the workings of the world, on the base of it, come from discrete mechanics and their arrangments; and indeed, this is what we mean by God, the interlocur of things: and reason is knowing such. But while this principal is in some sense explicitly basic, so is it seperate from observation, which remarks the proclivity of the tides which that principal creates. As we like to say, an ocean of parts, slightly ajar, and in motion, will coallesque, and to a refined degree whereby complexity emerges. And it is by the baser complexities that laws emerge. Nothing, to be clear, is really beyond what our reason supposes, or yearns for, but so in our active remarks, would laws mark the communion of behaviors, or norms rather. And from this there lies a somewhat grounded sense of the world and her ways: the structure at least. It may be so that one sees how such a strucutr, as regards humanity, is in need of that core principal, and what it means. But so is our own sense of whats needed, and the detailed happenings of which our reform attends, fashioned by the complexity of the world. Reason finds principle, and by that learns what it means, and thus what is required, for a thing, and at that where it starts and ends. But specifics come to question quickly, and our reason offers little. 
   <br>&emsp;What I see, is that we are afraid, in that without a rationale principal, whereby our observations ground themselves in terms of evauluation, that the world otherwise seems astray: for even in good fortune, the unprinciapled track of things pulls us eventually away. This is our fear.
   <br>&emsp;To some extent there is truth in this, as a lack of natural congruity holds no stable bar. But so is the actual activity of the world besides this, one which does not faulter without that sense. It may loose its track, and indeed, broader systems may not be so successful, but it is more like a quality of fuel and the sharpness of an engine, rather than being totally off. Moreso, the suggestions of others, which may not be totally of a core principal, don't alter the actual systems in any immedaite way. Indeed, the functions of our life change by our principals: our point indeed. But so does this take time, and to a proportioned effect. To tame your angst, understand the breadth of the world which naturally occurs, and how our principals change that. Indeed there are such principles which hold superstitous and or techincal truths; but so are these like garments which line the active path of our way. A real truth is in fact not much more than a permitt to conduct oneself as the world pleases; by which we can more fairly amend. Indeed we can look historically and see how polytheism and theism held a rooted grip on the culture, and institutions for some time. But beyond their sanctity, and the creepings into the civil parts of the law, so did our lifes more or less stay, as if there were no principal at all. The aspects of military, agriculture, technology and entertainment, merely had the church as a further member of our lives; and an orbiting sensibility regarding the task at hand. Solidiers, by their natural exposure to death, expressed such theisitic views, as did the bounds of theatere and literature hold reverant and bounded regards of a similar kind. This is all true, and holds a similar compelxion to the fears we have now. But we musn't characterize.  
   <br>&emsp;For one, the discrepency of current principles and old ones, despite those latter seeming out of touch, were not so much in their time. The trunk of such ways perhaps held savage and or impractial consqeunces, but so were these shades mixed with a plethora of other hues. In some sense, the extent of such princples in their effect of the civil world, was what removed its place, and at that people's inability to pursue other things. That is the birht of science: not its merrits, but the freedom to observe and research. And this is the mistake, in thinking that the world is trapped unless we offer it truth. Liberty is all we need: as indeed nature already holds us in her bounds: of which our successful response lies, and our living reward. It is ineed a reamrk of the kind of principles which remove liberty, in that there hopes are for things outside of our civil alffairs: and at that a sort of neglect and removal of efforts in that domain occur. While, the contempory view is that our civil lives are but an arrangment of the natural principle; and in some sense, understanding that, as one would wish for sense of any kind of principle, gives us clarity to such a path: and by that, in the broader sort of things, the civil part of our world can appropriate itself. As the prior prominece of principles led the long term direction to ends which were according to such principle: of which we should do the same. 
   <br>&emsp;But as a man, with cursioity and apprhension, you must understand your place as a fibre amidst the worlds strand. And such tapestry does not change in a day, nor in any solid degree outside our general remarks. "Does one death shake anything but its own portion of the whole." In that way, your insigfht into things out admitt the basis for such views, whether it is in awarness of a world there, and at that your cocneptions. For our modern day is full of knoweldge and expression, to which our impressions and stance on the world are high. But this position is one which is easily overlooked as a place which is inundated with a worldy exposure. Yet, there is nothing, of such a domain, which you really understand. As if there were some tale, which by virtue of the times, spoke of all and wide: yet like the legends of ancient times, so are we, despite the strucutre suggested, ignorant of any deatail or truth. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps we need some honesty as to assess and determine the basis for our reservations, how to calm them, and bear them; and then to deliber an actual resolve; one which is based on a delicate view of the world, and not overly drawn out by a thinness to our broad conception.
   <br>&emsp;But I lie here then, repraoched due to our sensibility not to be so ignroantly bold; but by this, more calm in our seperation from a supposed world, and at that, as learned as we've become to roemve such ingornace, not so distraught over the nature of such world, and our place in its existence. Not even the loopiness of the past seems so bad: as all bad which I ever did see, was poor in conception and delibery. Not only are isntances done by and to men, not characters and imagery, but so are such moments vast in number, and seperated by extensive amounts of time. There is no world truly for me to see. And my point overall, is that there is this self righteous, fair minded, sympathetic, and cynically grim wish to learn about what the world is, because there are those who seem to also see it, but ignorantly.

   The real question in life, is how the core workings of nature produce the consistent behaviours we see. Those, at least, can be described by laws: hence their consistencay. But the workings beneath lay somewhat hidden. Epsecially in our contempary days, the awkwardness of partciles holds some contrarety to such consistency, in that these baser pieces appear to act randomly.
   <br>&emsp;What is crucial to understand then, is of this base, how it operates as to promulgate the surface appearence we see.
   <br>&emsp;For it is one thing to see the broader world, and that it acts as those guided by laws; and it is another to say how these laws were produced. As learning so, can remove the weakness of such laws, in that we'd simply rely on them being truly so. For we may think that such behaviors which we dereive from them, can change, as the basis for laws sits unknown.
   <br>&emsp;This is so, for the workings of things, which laws are but a description of the consisatency of it all, still rests ontop of a sort of principle, which guides such consistency: or bends things as to be as if they were in motion through laws. At least, laws, being descriptions, don't serve as a principle, in temrs of why such descriptions hold true: in that we see that things appear orderly, and that some principle must govern that: laws are merely the understanding of the order, but not an explantion for it.
   <br>&emsp;As it stands, as God is presumed in and of himself, so may we assign a similar property to nature. And, as God is pantheistic, or a binder to all things, so can we see nature as such: in that she constitutes all. In that, the quest for man is one of understanding and knowledge, as to grasp the workings of the world in order to weild it, and to digest the sentiments of the latter, as to guide our way: in that the actions which our understanding procurrs, has some broader end which directs it. "One does not need the truth in order to operate a lever, or to see that it offers leverage: but that he should move as such, and for some aim, requires more than the mere ability to do so."
   <br>&emsp;Though, this is a fair insight, as passion seems a natural mark of how we be as part of the assembly: while reason, or discretion, holds more contemplative truths: as if to not simply go as your base self pleades, but to concern yourself with things less apparent.
   <br>&emsp;In that, I see the system of language as a hazzy factor; as understanding otherwise, can illuminate the fact that we are in fact natural and passionate, while also illustrating how reason, or reflection, is but a mode of such being: and at that, describe how such mode comes to being: as compared to a state of fear, and both its cause and effect.
</div>
<div id="betteradvance">
   It may be my privalge, but the fact that homo erectus was once our human state, and eutharians an age prior, gives reason to think that our 'concetpt' of thinking and mind, is but an unprincipled form of that. I cite the fact that savage tribes, whos words are less civil, appear as unclear as the most civil of foreginers, 'whose unknown language sounds like equal jibberish'.
   <br>&emsp;Theres just this strenght in believing that our 'reason' and derived principles, are but overly bent uses of an otherwise natural piece of our assembly: and at that are not so true. "Imagine if I told a lie, and a good one: you'd act accordingly. And if you found out it wasn't true, then your actions would change. And the important note, is how we hold beliefs, in terms of a howeler monkeys call of danager, to which we reply. And so much as a story or rumour compares, we need only concern with how different sounds are understood: the composites of syllables being a mere development of that."
   <br>&emsp;It is important to understand the weakness of absolute claims. As I see it, the mind is like a barrier, which exhibits itself by our expereince in the world: in the way that an incoming stimuli may trigger some sort of thought, or worded impulse (to run or hesitate). And I believe, that reason, as a sort of forced thinking, is but a forward step from that inner station. Only, such thinking is somewhat encased by the world: and so much as that world triggers us, so will our body feel equally outer. Why I think that principles and absolute conclusions lie, is that we reason from behind them: as if, by our inner nature, our specualtive thoghts are infront: to which our mind meets. And this is simply off.
   <br>&emsp;Where I lie, is that if reason is not a means to real principles, then we are  left with a inquisitive advance: one which reaches, rather than one which reaches a given. All that seems unclear then, is the nature of our thinking, its compsitions which we call thoughts, and our senses around this. In other words, if there is no princple, or doctrine at least, then we are left as some part of the world's assembly: our mind being akin to motor mehcanics: natural and physical. And this is fair, however unsifted. But the problem, or thing to clarify, is the nature of experinece, and how such a state of that assembly comes from such arrangmenets. For we know that the earth is but a result of entrop, and that such distribution is goverend by baser motions, and the truth of things at that. If our mind is such, then our actual remark of thinking, or self awareness, the idea of consciousness, needs some further strucutre, as to be polished off into a mere motion of the assembly. For, we know that thinking is akin to language, in that it is a behavior, of which motor mechanics is comparable. And indeed this all seems fair. But were lessening our selves by disregarding the otherwise 'tapping in' claims.

<div id="abalanceofcare">
   I could describe our life as a sort of reflection and apprehension, in that of the basis for things which we would propose from, this is not there; and of this abscence of proposal, the world feels weary to me. THis latter point holds a complexity which can only compare to that of our actual proposal, whereby the world would feel definite and thus small. While now, we are not so forward in this way, and at that, some what ill placed, or unsettled. This is partly due to our imagination, and the reality which we've ironed ourselves with beyond that; but also the sense that others believe in what they imagine, and at that, hold no regards for things impressionable which are at heart born of imagination. "As if they conceive of some thing, however normal, but in a typocal way; to which we judge them not on the reality of it, but there depth of what they imagine: but so are we given a dream: and folks around seem thus like dreamers." 
   <br>&emsp;Were simply stuck between being a propent of truth, and the bitterness of a 'typical world'. We are unsituated at least, and never quite grip the content of the former, nor coallesuqe with the currents of the latter. Which, indeed, comes from our abscence of occupation and friend for the sake of such princple; but unnecessarily, or awkwardly at that; whereby your quest for truth is so heavily banked on, that you have no place or time to be even somewhat outside of it. It is the case though, that our priority of philosophy is not an error, despite its congruence with other things. But such things really are whats lacking; in the sense that discovery is a process, and an ever growing one: to which your abandoment of all things besides this leaves you with nothing but a ceasing progress. "Such obsession is remarkable amongst many people, in that if they could only reach there." But we never do. At least, if we could and our inability to congregrate is the error, so does our principled efforts direct themselves accordingly. But imagine, if you were settled enough to forever make progress, and at that merely offer what you've found: for others to find more. What would you do? So much of me is banked on finding, that we'd see a retirement with company as a relief, in part because it is so stark in contrast. As is typcial, what occurs is a man absent of war, in that they have no pleasure in being at home, idle. To some extent the circumstances hold their obsession in finite, and then send them home to be free. But they have nothing to do there. And I'd say our care for philosophy is simiilar, differing only in that we are not serving someone then going home, but ever asking, thinking, defining. It is our natural curisoity after all.
   <br>&emsp;In other words, less you go into the trenches for a moment then return home, what is an actual path of life which is not so one sided, followed by the opposite. I'd say, upon inpsection, that our deepest care is some of the comforts surrounding our obsession, as we feel there lacking. This is hard to describe though, as we are not truly seeking compliments to our obsession, but less constriction onto such point, as to blossom outward and reach such comforts. By that, our grip on philosophy, prudence, untradition and things of alike, is but a portion of care, lingering more gently as we equally float above, where  friendship, romance, application and contribtuion lie. Leisure, industry and care line these things anyway, and seldom take away from eachother. At least, life can feeel quite condensed, as our youth has shown -when we became so obsessed with those latter interests. At that, our development is such as to iron out our prioirities, and give ourselves more room to breath, and by that more space to care. It is true, that if life were ending tomorrow, that blue skies and reason would hold my soul regard. But this sense that the worlds end is closer than it really is, comes from your obsession. At  least, the sensibility which such obsessions came from did so from grounds which had that compressed sense. So I understand. But our choices really are whats composiing me. For instance, we choose to move home, willingly mind you, but also with a sense of being spared, and gave to little thought about the stability and company we were leaving. Even a potential love interest. Now I know this. Nor am I looking to inevitbaly return with either a self aggrandized sense of those elements coming to be by virtue of who I am, or that they are in fact the soul purpose, and are as such in need of preperation or haste. These are younger notions, of which I hold no position on.

   I have never  lacked insight to what I doubt, or belief: only what I think of these things. It is one thing to notice that the orderliness of the world draws one to beleive that such a status can not be caused through an otherwise chaos, or goverened at random. But my curisoity about this sentiment, where it relates, how I see it, is what is so hard to say. Similar to how one's expereince shapes their life, so has mine be brought forward thorugh such mighty inquiries. They come often admitteldy, but are never so constant. At least, their frequency is a like a season, in that it ripesn up, is plucked, then weathers itself down while the soil replenishes. Thinking is just so rough, especially when it is about the basis for the principles in which you can act on. I have been this way for many years; and indeed prior to that were many more where I held no strong opinion besides that brazzen relation with the world. Because of this, I am not at all convinced that 'theorizing', or stitching as I'd say, is so hard or troublesome. Its just a matter of time till the starting premises blossom into conclusions: and doth our philospphy lays. Determing the beginning is the hard part though, and inquiry, more or less, is the concern of just that. This is why I admire Aristotle, for while Empedocles and Zeno were announcing their disocveries of fire, earth and wind, so was Aristotle issuing a humble statement, that of such principles, they ought hold more than such discrete properties. "Our basis is not so without these in mind." I don't follow his conclusions, as indeed his principles were not so correct: in fact he is in one case blatantly wrong, regarding falling bodies and their disspropitionat speed via their w weight. But I respect, and move myself, with the same concern for those starting princoples and their own efficacy. "For it is just engineering beyond that: while true inquiry gives us a mould to build."

   I know I will die. At least, I understand this to be a fair minded prediction, if not sensible awareness of a natural truth.
   <br>&emsp;But beyond that, lies what can only be described as our living time: where we reach such death. For suicide does not seem the path: but, in part, if not entirely, because there is more to do than simply die. 
   <br>&emsp;For one, I have needs, and at that, am quite mistaken to think that any compulsion 'to get death over with' is not born from such needs not being met. To an extent at least.
   <br>&emsp;By this, our needs are more or less tuned by nature, and in some sense, guilded by her own arrangment; at least, as ceratin parts of her have fledged one way, so have we, in our own exhibit, fledged with the means, and according desires, to amerloriate ourselves to such parts: oxygen for breathing, water for thirst, food for hunger and so forth. 
   <br>&emsp;In this way, nature has fitted us, as it seems at least, to find our route to such success amidst those with similar goals. And I might add those with exact goals, as penguins share most of those general interests. But it is of man I am speaking of, and whom I am most fond to share my failures and triumph. The path to them at  least. 
   <br>&emsp;As time has come, there has sprouted a sort of assembly of men, past the minor tribes and or bands who showed at most teamwork in their local affairs, but rather a grand, unified, constitutively ordained assmebly: modernity of which, is a mark where all those which blue, brown or any colored eyes, and skins of equal hues and variety, may live under such rules and governance. "At least, all those who consider themselves men, may hold counts to all others equal of care and aim." In some sense, our histroy of fighting has been due to a lack of understanding between another; whereby men whose values and principles difffer, so others like they do lions and bears: as other. That, and men are quite obvious in their capactiy, and at that, a evident power who is seemingly not on your side, or at least not someone you wish to be with, seems all the more apparent as an eventual threat. "Hence the gain of those put of by the heriatge of the Jews, who seem so unified and vast in their assembly: but again, other."
   <br>&emsp;Neverthless, our past disputes, and ones to yet occur, can be looked past as points of non-understanding, to the effect of each party seeing the other as forign: the response of which in men, akin to deer and most animals, is fear. "And again, Man, as a unalignd neigjbour, warrants more apprehension then even the greatest of bears: for not even those, even with their lesser might, hold grudges or commsiery: of which those suspicioous can compare." Relating oneself to thy enemy perhaps.
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, it is clear, with our needs and resolute assembly as a base, that our goal in life is one of virtue, so that we may be and flourish as is required and thus profitable, and of princple, so we may understand the whole world, as opposed to the mere fact of hunger. For again, we have that in common with the lions and bears, but are still nonetheless different. At least, Man seems to understand more about the world, and at that finds much relief through inudstry and his range of assemblies. But, through time and perpetuity, this understanding gets muddied with superstition and orthodoxy. Better yet, prior to this less than primitive stage, there is still a sense of other men being 'other': of which, outside the perverse postive stance, of which all those against are deemed accordingly, but even without any of this, there is still know binding factor for two assemblies otherwise foregin to one another. The positive reinforcement of cutlure and belief is but a sturdier posture as which to contrast oneself with others; whereby it is not merely about the mystery of another which causes hesitation, but a righteous stance of which all those unprivy are co-operatively denied. 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, I'd say that even if we had no proclivity for 'personal/local' principles, whereby all assemblies would surely differ, that we would still, by virtue of their being other assemblies, require some binding factor. Why man cares for his closest neighbour is hard to say, as monkeys live in troops, and grow and live amidst them as such; but are otherwise fearfull of, or hostile towards other troops. Why they are even friendly to anyone at all is hard to say. At least how such a unit ever came together is unclear. Of interest then, is whether there is any similar factor which binds such units and that which, if established, forms assemblies. It may be otherwise though, in that, of a family or friend, you feel secure with them based on your familiarity. While a foregin person simply appears as somewhat a threat, as you don't know them. Which, as I suspect, merrits a bindingp principle as serving as a means for bringing strangers together: as understanding eachother on that basis removes both some of the mystery, and at that the threat. "One could in all promise, travel across the world, relate to someone on even the simples basis, and find some congruency, if not harmony: more than if they had not." And in that sense, we'll say that what man needs to bring his local endeveours into global ones is a way to understand one another, so that, despite their unfamiliarity or peculiar differences, there cares, natures and interests and principlally the same. And indeed science has brought this, in that the truth it provides is one that all manner of folk can agree on.

<div id="theworldinme">
   As a thing, our needs are akin to other animals, in that we need warmth, fuel and security. Per the kind of animal we are, we socialze; compared to a bear. We are like other monkeys in this way. As men though, we assemble beyond the mere bounds of common groups, but form rather into nations, or governments. As a man though, I am not simply served by this arranmgnet -and all the proficiency it offers- but am indebted to, and, besides my actual service to it, am a contributing member by virtue of our conduct as a member; in that, by the core tenant of 'together and all, the whole is claimed', so do we avoid the vice of power, nor the leeching of the public good -whereby we take, but offer not. Again, our service is one thing, but so may we partciapte (the fair sentiment) by appreciating what is offered by those who do serve. It is not neccessarily my obligation to run for mayor; nor is it but my nature to converse about important matters, of which the subject of 'who will be mayor' and our means to vote will come up. We simply must not take what those who serve give, without the sense that we are not the only ones recieving; nor should we be frustrated by such servicemen, as if their role was to serve us in particular. That is the basis for morality, as it reflects the heart of proper conduct as a man. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, if we lived in a whole without air, or a limited amount, then the basic need of this would overide anything we thought otherwise impoprtant. And, at that, if we truly were congenial to one another, so would our time following the treatment of air, correspond with the fact that others need also be served. At the very least, we ought not act in a way that will require more air, as the spot of others is not to be given up for you. The point, is that whatever our needs are, that such a matter concerns the core of our concerns, and thus the appropraite measure of action. In that, circumstance may arrange what we are to do in order to serve the needs we have. The needs, generally, do not change; but consider a food shortage and how that would require we orient ourselves accordingly. 
   <br>&emsp;Neverthless, the principle which directs us, to which we comply, is the basis for our concerns, and at that in need of declaration. For starters, the whole of things, nature, the world or universe, entirety if you will, is more or less essential, in that it is not but what it is made of, and nothing more. That means, that mind, body, soul, heart and spirit, are not things seperate from this domain. Not even God is. "For what is the world if not God? If it is something other, then what is it?" This concern, along with other near matters, is a target for propositional delegation, in that aside from statements made from baser truths, of such beginning we must decide. That is, inquiry and principle investiagtion, is a remark of our aim of nature's basis, so that we may say, for one, there is one, and, there being so, of which kind, cander and complexion. 
   <br>&emsp;For starters, we ought remove any sentiments which afford apprehension at an otherwise laudible truth; as per our developments, we may believe in conclisions which are favored based on our preference for them; that, or we may understand them in ways that conjoin with other believes, and at that resists any crucial change -on the basis of whats familiar. Notable in this, is a change in our conceptions based on expereince and testing, as to remark knowledge which has to do with the world, and is corraberated by the world in how such statements are propsoed: in that they promise one thing, and are verified by their accurate success. This, in some sense, warrants us, and in some way requests of us, to be progressive in our understanding, seeing as our expereince and testing are continuous. That, or we simply ignore, or be mindfull, of the imperative beliefs and 'evidence' which are rooted in antiquity (and according behaviours). For current obseravtions, relativley old one's even, say that nature operates in irreversible ways; at least, in terms of her physicality, her currents are not so whilly nilly changed. And matters of mind and spirit are one thing, by their ambiguity at least, but as regards the body, or things clearly physical, so are they subject to such aspects of nature, in her physical irreversibility. On this account, Jesus or any other mark of a miracle, can, more or  less, produce the reason and thoughts which correspond with the substance of their miracle; but that Jesus' body stood upright, walked, or that he blinked his eyes -and at that used his muscles- and respirated, is simply a contradiction to the material of nature. If the mind is seperate from such material, then like a echo there may have been a voice looming around Jesus' corpse. But neither could his body have stood up, nor, if the mind is material, or not seperate at least and thus bound to material (as if the body were a host, and through its form), then so would there not be such elements of the miracle. And, perhaps the crassest element to our discussion, is the denial of such an event, which, upon proof and a scale of contraiety, that one's expereince of this (or regards for it) is more akin to imagery: as one would find in their literal hearing of a myth or tale. If modernity has anything to say, then the mind is in fact, as the subject otherwise unboundless supposed, a composition of nature's assembly, and is thus not in fact seperate or beyond, but is a portion of our own assembly -as our mind is of us, not something other, but so are we but a variation of a physical, or real rather, arrangment, as the rock, to which our mind is but a strand of our personal assembly. Regarding that, the 'description', or identity rather, of the phenomena known as 'experincece', or sensation, needs, and likey struggles in being so, defined. But neverthless, like gravitry and particle mechancis, so doth the domain and quality of nature lay. And consequently, there is no qualified reason to suppose that the mind is seperate, no matter if we can not describe how it is real. Our faith is in reason and the according humility and resolve to remain both optimistice of our resolve and inquiry, and our uncertainty. "Our composure in this, like a muscle, will form itself into a dispostion which sees such mysteries without trepadation." Because despite our haziness of how things really are, we can at least, by virtue of observation and experiemnts refined scope of eligibiulity, remain stout and pleased upon our approach to a increasing truth: but, in effect, one which holds no warrant or (beyond sentiment) respect for tradition or 'believed' expereince. By one's liberty, they may spread lies, sell rumours and or hark ill wisdom; just as I may tell the truth, or my suspicion of it anyway. But if one's beliefs and experince are so laudible, as to cause others to agree to such findings and at that a mark of resolve, so ought such occurences be verifable, or at least merritable to the promise which their declarations sprout. Why should there be fear of reform or questioning, if our care is merely for the truth: what would be wrong if someone found a better anwser? Perhaps it is due to the wobbliness in which your beleifs are based on. That, and the fact that, considering the revelations in question, that such incidents seldom serve as grounds to conclude, but confirmations for which you already beleive. And I struggle in deciding whether or not to be polite, but then affirmiative to the conclusions worth any merrit; or if I should just remain suggestive, and merrily illustrate the flaw in your conduct. It is indeed your place to make such claims, despite the fact that my equal liberty is held in content. But I'd only then define the status of man in that he is so nilly in his peace and happiness because of such conflict; and whether or not you are right I do not know; but is it likely that anyone, or at least all but one assortment of anwsers, is correct? Is nature not but her own way, the truth of which is in describing that soul principle? Even on the basis of core physics, there are rudimentary sentiments which say that reality can only be a certain way in order to exist. "In other words, how could there be multiple neccessities, in our domain of nature that is -which is all one in such a place should care about." 
   <br>&emsp;Because what I would say, is that seeing as nature is soul, in that, for our purposes, she is one, and at that, is more or less entire in her ways, and but a weaver in her compositions of which we are some, that so ought we, in our regards, measure ourselves as such, as portionsos of this, and, as a mere atom is attracted to another by gravity, that so are we, wiuthout hestiancy, normally drawn, by which our needs are stated; and from that, as part of our composure, ought we work from such urges, as inspiration at least for the sake of motion, and like monkeys who use rocks to open nuts, or our own bretheren who used ingenutiy to open coconuts, that for us, who's use of a coconut is comprable to the similar task of one's 'sealed husk' of there mortal state, that so ought we equally quest for such solition. As one via their dexterity discerns the contstruct of the coconut, and proceeds to a tool which yeilds success, that so ought we, in our broader regard for civility, happiness and death, bear similar inspection to the construct of nature, as to see her ways, and at that a hole in which we can fashion our screw. For we need neighter a further motitavtion to open such husk, nor the reason to accomplish the task which we found a solution for; nor the desire to drink the succulence. We must simply know who we are, why were here asking about nature and not, as it had been, opening an actual coconut; and by that, understand how such orders of occupation come to be, and the freedom which we'd be otherwise actionable on, if not for other minds around, 'tightening their own conceptual screws, or having their own literal coconuts'.

<div id="thosearound">
   The world's complexity often reveals itself, simply in the way that our more private thoughts are in fact not so strictly contrasted to an otherwise general norm, but a frontier of various opinions. That, and the medium of conduct alters the speech so much, that despite the homogentity of attide and style, that so is everyone more or the less the same in how they crudely differ. 
   <br>&emsp;No one gets what your saying; and that is mostly due to you trying to say to much. Hearing the words is quite important for someone offering many, and in a forum which does not flourish on such stlye.
   <br>&emsp;What I see, is that people are nervous about the ignorance they see of others, and others listening to them. In terms of politics this seems the case, while in entertainment the concern is more about one's personal view dampening your own: considering the leisruely content in regards.
   <br>&emsp;I've noticed though, that although each person responds rather poorly, or apprhewsnsivly to what you say (since you say so much), that each does so on their own. It seems to be the nature of the medium, and your ill-fit for it. The response though is not unified. Even if someone comments, and another on them, so is this but a stimluated event between the two, and likely to a quick end. 
   <br>&emsp;This may just be the internet, though television and other commentary sources are perhaps similar. 
   <br>&emsp;I've mentioned, or thought rather, that having a principle understanding of the world elicits not only a station for you, but a sensibility about the stance of others. Media, and onnline ones at that, via forums, sparks this abbrasive reaction, whereby everyone feels a threat, and you need to be heard. This is a manic, if not otherwise appropraitey small posture, and at that fosters imagery of the world around. While reading words is quite calming, as the space of your views broadens, holding much, and of less severity and haste. "For so much room calls on equal amounts ot time to make things happen." 
   <br>&emsp;By this, I see how such a life, as fairly seen, bears an insight into you, in that your right place is in fact your quality of life. While it once seemed that we were to go against the ignorance we saw, or recieved; but so did this, in response, elicit an irrational stance on a truly non problem. For, the coarse truth is that as you are out of line as one who listens and speaks with this 'clumped' sense, that so are ohers who respond of the equal nature, and at that not some cohesive force to fear. Its like a civil event which draws letters from citizens; but they do so on their own accord, and at that have but privately expressed colelctive strenght. That is the falsity of crowds, in rallies or concenrts namely. As, I have known, that right outside those doors walks someone with no sense at all.  The broader mechanics of sociabiliy and conversation occurs, in that one learning a thing spreads it like a virus: but so are we not so addressable of such  matters, in ways that eleicit anything but a local struggle. That, and it remarks one's character to be so hurredly tossed by others, and at that, so does there even headeness permitt only so much as seems warranted; and, as I'd suggest, the matter of whos mayor, govenor or executive, is not of anyones concner. Their attention is on A) the response to whatever these changes are, but B) the elements truly important to their lives, namely chidlren, work, friends, partners, interests, leisure. The constituion of their lives is but ingratiated by their cooperation, as to amend as their scenario promises them in order to earn their ends within this assembled means. This raises the question of 'intelelctual groups' or public conversation; as such things feel impactfull. It is hard to place them with respect to the world they speak of, and not to overestimate their place as not being the sum  of that mount. The news doesn't run the coutnry, nor tv or the media. Peopel are watching dramas, sports, eating food, playing sports or games, watching film, at work, driving, doing chores or arrends. The news is like a lingering voice, which however attended, gets molted over by the primary concerns of life.

<div id="thetruthinme">
   The world is a certain way, and in some sense, a way that remarks how it should be. 
   <br>&emsp;We are social creatures, with needs and a sense of commradery to faciliatte that. 
   <br>&emsp;The world is arranged as such. As death is a fair expection, so is it fair that the world is so broadly governed, and not for your particular gain. I feel like people's actions, be alone or in groups, act as if the world is not such; and we too, in hearing there words, respond as if they mean something outside the real state of the world. 
   <br>&emsp;At least, the world is in success so much as it follows the deepest principle. In that sense, the good which comes from gaming is in fun, and if there is any then something fair is happening. And like those who get upset otherwise, in gaming or governance, so is there a clear ignorance to how such domains are. Games are made to be fun, in return of which we pay. If we have no fun, then we won't pay again, nor will we speak highly to others. Moreover, the promise of fun is something people have to bank on, as marketing may be misleading. If your drawn though, and at that set on the basis of the product at hand, then you can at least look forward to purchasing it, and then at worst be dissapointed. Goverment is similar, in that it is a certain way as to correspond with  our shared means, and at that, what is worth discussing is not that such a principle be adhered to, or in which manner. All concerns are further derived; and seemingly empty if they don't rest at such point of derivation. The world doesn't care if you think its soul is off, for its action as such is so solid and ingrained, that not but those derived elements are even questionable, or discernable at least. Better yet, to speak of the world requires that the heart of it be addressed, otherwise the smaller matters which irriate us will cause a small view of the entirety below to be ridiculed as the source of such a grand hissy. Gaming is similar, in that developers make games, advertise for the sake of those who don't already know or care, and turn their profits into further production.
   <br>&emsp;My point overall, is that a game, a movie, a book, anything really, is not important enough to fuss over, compared to the principle aspect of our lives. That remarks virtue and understanding, and some ideal sense regarding our lives as members amidst others, and how that, currently, is. Its like a movie; if you pay 15$ and don't care for it, don't recommend it, make a post about it explaining the reasons  (as solid concerns draw solid attention), and let it be. If the money was entirely wasted, well ask for a refund; and if thats not eligble, learn, exhibit your sense of what you like; but deal with it at most by expressing yourself, rather than overestimating the worth and or ability to marshal change. Think of a resteraunt, and if you get a bad meal. Commerce varies in practice, but if the meal is terrible, you may get it cut from the bill. Otherwise, if it is just simply unenjoyable, you surely say nothing, if not but a passing remark. As you have no rights to demand anything, but choose how you then consume. And it would be weird to later demand that a resteraunt change. Why the hate? Is it because you want it to be better: on what basis. Did you like it at one point and not now, and feel a sort of loss, and thus motivation to renew. Its one thing to fully conduct yourself for this purpose, be it your cares for star wars or democracy. But of what you are actually best to concern yourself with, so is it fair to remark a nelgect of things more primary if your otherwise cares are along the lines of obsession. I chalk it up to neccessity, and if your not fed, then you fight, to the death even, like one struggling for air. But merchandising goes that way; nor is anything but an explicit waste of money much more than a subjective expereince. Objectively even for some, but still yours to feel meh over. Its just not worth listening to those who are obsessed, or simply concerned, but act with the force of bravado and control, as if they wished to merely inform. These things aren't neccessary is my point; nor is their place but a dervied strand on a deeper whole. That reflects the basis for it not being so important, and the structure according to that which makes the 'ameloriation' of the situation less explicit. If someone committs a crime, the seriousness of that has corresponding elements of the world to attend. While a bad coffee has not much but an apology; that, and a likely plea to come again next time -with the promsie it will be better. Leisure has a sort of continutity though, in that one may play for days at a park, but then have it close, or be changed; which makes it seem like an injury which you wish wasn't there. 
   I'd say there is this notion of neccessary if not circumstantial evidence, whereby one's expereince is dictated by particular matters local to a scenario. In the case of Star Wars, we are angsty about and frustrrated towards future ones, because we have seen good ones; that, and other ones were not so good, that now were in this limbo, where we know it can be, or wish it to be good, but have  less hope that it will. Our care though is essential, as we remain concerned about the future film; becaue our cares keep us attatched, our state of motion brings negativity, frustration, obssession and ownership. I bring up the basis of our life, where something goes astray and we lack what we need: those feelings of lack which we have for star wars are never encouraged, respected, or successfully done. Nature is something we have to elevate ourselves against, and our assmebly to do so effeciently and or fairly provides the menas for us to leverage our time in order to earn what we particualrly need. While our care for Star Wars is something we can fairly give up. Its cares are from freedom, but not for it. And so I censor our conduct with fair approach, but with unneccessary bounds, merely interests and reserved passion. 
   <br>&emsp;We apply ouroselves differently. Our excesses vary, but can get carried out of hand. It seems snesible, regarding taste, that those who exhibited their interests slimily and with anger, held no interest for those similary drawn, or curious about someone expfressing their care. This is my understanding of leisure. Social norms and conduct get sucked into this, in the slimy expression, and at that hold no real interest. Nor, depsite the 'aim' of things essential, do we earn any contempt. "A rash critique of government is not, if ignored, some sign of one ignoring the imporatnt of government." One ougnht simply not be so pressed up against the princple, that theres nothing but air around (empty volume), nor so seperated from the principle that any substance given is dissproportionate or fitted for such principle. "One can not so blatantly or fluffily speak of democracy withotu extending the contents of what that means, nor, can one be particualry critical, on some specific point or basis, towards democracy." At least, seeing as democracy is a principle, our discoure regarding that is to do with it as a princople; while remarks about 'our democracy', or the world rather, be it democracticr or not, needs remark that actual world.
</div>
<div id="thoughtbyme">
   The world is whats assessed, in that it is of a simple manner. At least, the elements which combine into our view of the world, are events, and experiences at that. If memory weren't a thing, or different rather in lower animals, then so would they see the world like we do, in that events for them were similar to ours. Memory though allows for combinations, while lacking memory means that 'your worldview upon this event' is not paired with a view made from prior events.
   <br>&emsp;From this lies judgement and meaning. One being a remark of principles, in that an event was not in line with such principle, and could be judged as good or bad; and of meaning, lies observation and experiment, as to understand how the world operates, and at that what future events will occur. 
   <br>&emsp;One of the loopiest concepts is consistency, or of the constance of nature's function. Besdes what we can presume as contradictory, the question of an event happening due to a process of nature, and at that is likely to occur via that process again, lives on the assumption that such process will A) stay present, and B) stay tuned, as to create that predicted effect. 
   <br>&emsp;Lets be frank about this. If someone in ancient times were to go atop a tower, or a tree, take a fairly large rock and strawberry, then drop them, then the consistent finding that they each hit the ground at the same time would be sufficeint as to expect that this will occur. At least, per that expectation we are inducting, via likelihood. However, as gravity was understood, or the motions of things falling, or via an attraction from some object, that despite the consistent findings, and determinations/descripitions which remarked that, that of the basis of this, or source, so did we not know. As it later became discovered, that gravity, or the effects of attraction (which we call gravitational, rather than electromagnetic) is due to the curvature of space: similar to a mass being placed in a fabric, and causing a groove in the material by which something placed in it wouuld run by. Now, further observations and experiment are measured against this theory, and as they rightly correlate, so does the theory find some validity. That, and the seperate observations which are used to correlate, then have their own explanation. 
   <br>&emsp;What this means then, is that, the falling of two objects of different weight for instance, falling at the same speed, may in fact be inconsistent on the unsure constancy of such source. But, that such basis would produce such ends, or influences rather, so long as it is there, seems fair to assume. And, if the basis' nature changed, and produced different influences, then so would our observations comply. And by virtue of Astronomy, who holds a crucial lens into all of our insights, that contempary observations of the sort are so vast, that we in fact have a reputable source, or ledger rather, which can attest to the influeces being expressed. As it were, such influences have not changed, and the many observations of stellar phenomena appear to be subject to the effects we came to know. In that sense, we can simply say, 'is the world the same', and if so, then we can bank on both the findings and future discoveries born of such basis.
   <br>&emsp;In this sense, we are still operating on the consensus that events occur via baser influences; and that our description of such influences, upon repeated insight, gets attribubted as laws, or principles rather. In many ways there is not much but a warring sentiment of past insights mixed with those more recent; and whether or not the advances of knowledge ought be valued more than prior levels of insight. You'd think overall that such an advance would rightly build and build. But theres this defense against newer discoveries which suggest things different than what was once supposed. And this, is due from revelation.
   <br>&emsp;For starters, revelation, or the defense of it, comes mostly from the fact that it confirms what someone inherintly knows. "Dad, is God real? Well yes son, but I suspect you want proof: there is none. Well how do we know he's real then, if theres no reason. Well on one hand, there is a reason, in that there must be. We are aren't we, blessed; that, and does the world itself not appear ordered? Could such refinement occur via randomness and chaos, or something of a governing sort. And besides all that, considering the truth which we know in our hearts, or are best to believe, so is our assurance of this born through faith, in that we trust that what is to be shown, or given rather, and at that conveyed, is via Gods hand, and will at that."
   <br>&emsp;I'd say that an antrhopoligcla argument could be made as to why this position came about. I think its roots lie in the earliest ape looking up at the stars, and seeing them as events/objects which were not so alike his otherwise wild expereince; which could be described through motions of fear and desire, fashioned by pleasure and pain. But the stars, or a comet, a catalclyysmic event even, beyond the complexion of the impression (in the alarming nature of the latter), that so do these things seem somewhat beyond, and at that seperate from the elements of their ordinary expereince. This surely occured amidst our construction of words, and thus any defined mention of God or principle. "It was simply the awe that one today even finds, as they sit infront of a fire, or see the sun set and rise. A prominent yet weightless expereince, as you are somewhat taken outside yourself, and set to pleasantly be." Such an experinece seems the root of our millenial advancment into defined language and culture. And at that, circusmtnatial evidence permitting, that from that point where orators and or the ordinary dialect of men, could observe, consider and pronounce the meanings behind such 'outwardly' impressions, that so was there no lack of conceptions from the millenia prior, if only dissolute and primitive. God, I reckon, or at least the details which bore substance beyond that of primitive man, seems comparable to our modern conceptions, in that of those views prior, so do our current ones reveal their weakness. And, as the Jews, or even earlier devout bands of man, held their own conceived world view, that so were those an age prior but a less configued sort: or defined one at that. There are cave paintings of Bison from 50,000 years ago; and its hard to imagine that the clerical theism which antiquity is home to, did not have some fainter analog in those ancient times. Or, better said, the question is one of devout prescence, or outwardly concpetion. For if there were, then it seems fair to suspect that such viewpoints were fit for the times: animalistic for instance. While the understanding of the Jews, and classical thinkers at that, seems like medieval men do now cmmpared to Einstein or Emerson. The place of such principle seems unclear; though my ignorance probally defects me by not knowing a likely obvious example (like the bison painting) of religious and or 'outward' princples (in action). Nevertheless, so much, and how far back, such princple is shown, it seems but a propositional weaving is required to stitch together the developments of such principle: from ancient, to classic, medieval and the present. That, and as reflects that principle and its proclivity to make those subject to it somewhat 'foolish', if not overtly sensitive, that so lies our current point of conquest, as to solidify the merrits of that principle, in how each point of development brought new merrits, and at that ironed out or threw away prior findings. Doth tradition lay.

   What appears true to me, in some sense, is based on the truth which is. I may be mistaken, and surely culpable of contrasting thoughts. But nature's ways seem quite simply, and single at that. And from this, I see that our view of things, if born of what is most sensibel, or corresponding rather to that, is fairest. 
   <br>&emsp;And my point is not to fashion any sort detail beyond this truth, but to speak what the basis for such truth is. It will be but an adventure past that.
   <br>&emsp;Simply, like Hume, I don't think we can conceive of objects outside the elements present within our expereince. If we saw in infared, then so would our visual regards work from such. And all things conceptual equally fair, in that if we wish to assess, judge or suppose, so are the words and ideas born of what we have perceived and, via our strucuture, conceived internally: and new things thus become fitted via such instruments, or pieces rather. 
   <br>&emsp;At that, I am quite fitted to rest all of our understanding on the routines of observation, and to attest to others (perhaps differnelty views) stances as a mere happening of that. On the basis of Hume, not only are our ideas, or sources at least, based on who we are and how we discern all things -from starting and or initial concepts to those we build upon- but so then (in summary at least) do our conclusions lay. At that, our nature seems such as to consent to the definitions it finds, which it does so by the conduct of its means of sense, and the fashioning of which we only have organs and or surrounding concpets (born of an equal process). Because of this, there seems not but who we are and the world we see. Which, indeed seems to liken to the notion of revelation, where nature shows us herself; and of such inputs, we discern and amend. But from this, it seems the fair line of discretion lies in the truth of the concepts, or definitions rather. Rather than remark upon the particular assembly by which we particualry percieve things, I'd simply conclude on the fact that the result of such perceptions is the goal, and at that merely sourced from precepts. And at that, our discourse and or iqnuiry seems best aimed at ameliroirating the proper conduct in assessing such impressions, analyzing them by the best means, then judging them with blend of austerity and propeity as regards derived principles. For this last part holds the dearest trick, as the nature of our procees being one of impressions and concepts, leave us with somewhat of a constant advance. 
</div>
<div id="thepastinwe">
   So much explanation. Maybe its not so much that the method for discovery is divisive, but the actual results from it. It may simply be that those who expereince revelation believe that the observation is sound enough to warrant to the fitting conclusion.
   <br>&emsp;At that, the fidelity, or parameters rather, by which we accept observations and their findings is what varies. As miracles are defintively unreplicabe, nor indicitative of natural laws. Nor are they but suggestions of how the world is, and not the source for our beneovlement conceptions. Those come from neccessity, which itslef comes from the admittence of the world being facilated by principle: which itself is drawn from the observation that nature is somewhat orderly. Although I am not sure if this suggests that such order is consistent; that is, if it can be suspended, or is an otherwise symphotic stream of motion born and governed thrugh such princple, but with cooperation of every bit and strand. At least a harmony and soul to the garment.
   <br>&emsp;I sit here then, quite ill fit to deny the observations of the past, if onyl to meagerly say that their approach to discovery holds no compariosn compared to the rigorous insights in modernity. And should it be? Gallielo discovered the moons of Jupiter, and Einstein the curvature of space. Hubble illuminated the multi galctic nature of the universe. And, oddly, there were deniers of that in a similar manner to those who deny all but revelation and such. This is a fairly common occurence then, of accepting observations and their findings. 
   <br>&emsp;Part of the trouble is in the trepdation of this observant nature. For we cannot quite discern anything true. That is, unless we presume some principle, however fair. But indeed, the grand struggle of man, is in the actionable nature of God, as tradition presumes. For modernity does not conieve of the world this way. And, for me at least, the source of the former sentiments comes from the relativley limited amount of knowledge, and the impossible suppositions which would otherwise keep the consquent princples as being absolute. At least, if they were, so would the extent of our presumption (regarding them) only serve as a minor basis for what we otherwise know. For now, we more or less must presume some principle that serves as the basis for our knowledge so far. The knoweldge the ancietns held though was tne thousand times smaller, and at that, meager in scope: as the edge of a billion galaxies now, was what our local sky seemed. I must admitt, that there are two elements of such tradition, namely the sentiment of the divine, which can assumingly be found in the oldest of men, and secondly, of the more classical sentiment of reason, or morality rather, by which the fairies and mountain gods are put away as superstitous, and while theism reigns instead; where the proposed sentiments are one of will and salvation. At least, theres a neccessary flow to life, by which we wholly amend. Or, in short, the classical way of looking at the world is in neccessity, as reflects the purpose of princple and its offering of a truly blessed life. That is why further  observation is halted, as the propiety for that righteous way is protected. Such interpreations hold little stature, but there objective more so. And indeed I find much merrit in the classics, as they understood the true meaning of our lives. But the actual complexion of us, the world and the propiety to blend it, is not so well founded, and goes only to show that despite the proper resolve to be principled, that the true course of action is one which best learns how to actually be so. Perahps such older ways were stricken to the very notion and act of being principled, that any rigor in discerning the details of how was forgone: or at least seen as a source of confusion and or distraction from being principled at all. At that though, lies the true conflict in man: not between his cave dwelling beliefs and that of Einstein, but of the classical moralists and the modern skeptics. 
</div>
<div id="marksonme">
   I cannot say what true knoweldge is. Indeed this has been written about since the dawn of recent time.
   <br>&emsp;But, like a burnt hand is so, and pain at that, regardless of your reasoning about it, so do I have expereicnes and their impressions left in me. 
   <br>&emsp;This is where the trouble with reasoning comes in. For I do believe that most of it aims at proving things we already believe in as true.
   <br>&emsp;What I see, is that events leave a mark on us, and build anticipation at that. Even those elements which seem a given, in terms of gravity, the sun, respiration etc. Death and illness also compare, but these seem like givens which you will only surely meet, rather than something inherent to your days. That, and as this course of life, be it daily or eventual, is the common if not known case, then so are the right actions one which accomodate themselves to that, as to fully address the way things are. Virtue is a sort of lush process amongst this, as she too brings one in line with the finer currents; in the sense that prudence would say in any given scenario, that by its likley course, that being punctual, dignified and prudent were to your profit.
   <br>&emsp;However, not everything that appears to us has an analog which we can weight it against. For one virtue indeed is a self fashioning towards even the finest strands of your life; but in an active sense, so may a new piece of information, or suggestion rather, have nothing to mingle with, in terms of what you already knew. Yet, you may know other things, and at that, have an idea what this absent slot would likely hold, on the basis of slots, and other 'heuristic' regards. This is where principle comes in, or our presumptions/shortcuts which make up for lost knowledge. For I may hear that a war is occuring in another country, but so is that not the world, even if I don't know what the world is. I at least have some sense of space and time, and can extend this outward, if only through reason/compulsion, to fill in the gap. For people may indeed be swindled or convinced by impressions which they have nothing else to compare. But even though I don't know if Aliens exist, I still have so much relevant knowledge that can be slotted in, fairly or not, to deny the plausibility of there being so.
   <br>&emsp;So the idea of Morality is an anthropological one, and has its source in directing one's passions towards reason. The story of this though becomes a thing in itself, and muddies the philosophy which acts as though the nature of things must correspond with the story. 
   <br>&emsp;Then Hume and Kant come along, and say that both our impressions and reasoning are dictated and or limited by our own cognitive processes and assumptions. Per the datum we percieve, and the correspondence with some supposed other, so can such datum only be viewed and or discerned by our personal faculties. While our actual thinking about this has its own moulds for thought, and at that principles which we act on, 'as if molding the subject of thought through a canvas already in place'. That is humes notion of association, and Kant's critique on reason.
   <br>&emsp;Where this leaves us is beyond the principle need of some moral scale in order for good actions to be done and bads ones to be decreed. Life is far more natural, and at the very least, removing the errors of the past, or primitivness of it, so does the modern approach see man as part of nature, with a process amidst such assembly; and pyschology and behaviorial science more credibly discerns how such process is in terms of knowledge and beliefs. 
   <br>&emsp;It all comes down to the impression one gets from a tale of yonder, where the folks behave weirdly, or some incident of heroism or tragedy. For one, these are not so obviously assessed, beyond the actual impact of their concpetion. Primarily though, their concpetion leads to a sort of 'world filling', where hearing one thing leads to a conclusion regarding the broader world: as if such a moment reflects what could be expected in others. Khanemon and Taversky have demonstrated many ways in which we jump to such conclusions. And indeed, ideas of morality and are built on top of this, at least by the roots of ancient impressions which get passed on as beliefs. The idea at hand is not neccesarily wrong, but the process of finding truth ought not be in confirming what we already believe. At least, be it in reaosn, the subject ought be somewhat defined without bias', and otherwise corresponding to other evidence we have. "Espeically as regards nature as a whole, in that all things more or less coalesque." 
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, despite our capctiy for being fooled, so are we capable of rightly knowing. For, if I hear a tale, it would remark something of me to confirm the details befor concluding what happened; at  least, before I act as if it is true. More importantly though, if I hear there was a dragon spotting, besides confirming this, ought I refer to my knowledge of the world in order to incorporate what this new piece of evidence means: rather than letting this peice of evidene be an indicator of how the world is. At that, ask yourself, what is this new event offering me in terms of insight? What exactly is it suggesting in terms of how the world is? For I may know a few facts about the world, and at that feel somewhat reserved in how this new incident becomes incorporated into that broader view. In other words, if a government scandal occurs, it would seem to suggest that the government is evil; and considering the place of government in the country, and the world at that, in other countries with their own governments, so may you concluded that the world  is evil. Or has such evil. But then you remember, or are considerate of the fact, that the government is composed of millions of people, many divisions and organizations; and at that, has various zones and hiearchies. All I would think then, is considering this scandal, who is in fact invovled with that, what does that say about those who weren't, and to the degree that they are, how does the government appear by that. For the initial conclusion was that the government was evil, as the scandal painted the entirety of the government as so. While seeing that only a portion of the people invovled were part of the scandal, and at that a large portion of the government is not either culpable or assocaited with such actions, within our address at least, then all we are left to say is that the government is not perfect, as obviously there is some evil as to produce such a scandal: but nothing else is known from that. And without some other information to sway me, I am at the very  least left with the notion that, to the extent which the scandal does not reflect the government, so is it not evil to that extent. And the fact that our conclusions can be so varied, makes me believe that there is both A) an importance to the contents which the conclision is based on; or in other words since this has to do with knowledge, that knowledge is thus important, and B) that becuase our use of such contents can vary, that the means by which we do so bears a point of fidelity: which itself is made worthwhile by the importance of knowledge. At least, it is necessary for knowledge to be important if we are to discern the acceptence and or judgement of it.
   <br>&emsp;I am not sure what there is to be afraid of besides what we know is worth acting as so. Is there any real reservation besides the statements of others, or the expereince of yourself? To do with God, morals, war, success, shame, is any of it sourced from that which is besides your part in the world? And to remark Hume, could you think, in terms of a subject, and with any words or ideas, which were not birthed from such a place? That, and would an abscence understanding the givens of that world, or at least the prescence of lingering expereinces which filled in such gaps, not produce impressions and conclusions of an according basis? 
   <br>&emsp;And at that, ought we know, what it means to know, and how well we understand what this process is, and its relevance? For at some point, we must say what we know, say what we don't, and suitable address the difference. "Perhaps modernity is in flow, when the steps of it are not held back by the brevity of ancient tradition: which are themselves determinations built on primitive grounds." 
</div>
<div id="theprocessoftime">
   Describing the vectors and significance of knowledge fairs the initial taks. For we can speak of qualitys, or presumptions rather regarding aims, but so long as the properties of nature are unclear, so will our values and calm be unsteady.
   <br>&emsp;The issue is largely due to the lineage of men's expereince, and how truths which were once thought so sure, become less so; yet people don't have as much allegance to the means by which truth is come by, but their belief in it. In a contemporay sense, why would anyone ever disagree about anything scientfici, if that which was proposed only held merrit by the demonstrations available; nor, would there be any worth in addressing anything besides that. A truly intelligent man would not shut down any ones suggestion, but remark upon the basis for it. That is all there is. But contempoarly, we still don't behave as though this is true, and let our biases and prejudice get in the way. That, and the old world having such little speculative means, meant that there was so much variety in what people belielved happened. "If none could verify, then the personal impression one got was all there was; but so mucbh as we are talking about things complex, is this method unreliable, and at that varied in the ways that innaccuracy occurs." 
   <br>&emsp;There is something to be said about the dynamics knowledge has in our lives, and why we get defensive when other's suggest things we think false. But there lies the concern, as to the place of knowledge, and whether or not there is any other subject which warrants concern. Because if there is not, and our relevant part of nature is composed of impulse, thought and action, then so can we settle on the fact that the core of our philosophy and world understanding is such. For the present has more reliable means to learning of the world, and at that results which are both robust and testable. In some sense, the contrast of the past and modernity, is that the former saw all proponents offer an absolute claim; while the latter offered rigorous insight the actual portions of nature, and at that, one's discovered from those baser findings. This is how physics, chemistry, biology, geography and anthropology, electronics and industry occrued. And an important tool in our inquriy is in distinguihshing between generally accepted ideas, and that of neccessity. For what things must be is hard to say, and of the reasoning for which others base their neccessity on, I am failry ignorant of. I can say though, that broadly speaking, that entirety remarks the whole. Nature, in all fairness, is equal to that, but in some schools of thought, it is a seperate domain than that which it is housed on: namle the eternal world. At any rate, the motions of nature, be it entire or governed, are definite in kind, regarding pieces that is; while arrangments, despite being a mark of the fashioning of such basis, are themselves ostensible figures of the principal forms. In the way that gases are but zooming particles, or ice a chilled assembly. That, or how a planet is but a clumped ball of dirt -as described by entropy. That, and for all complex structures, these are merely the compositions of distributed material, itself born of field flucuations and dark matter wells. I will submitt the promiscuity of the mind, and how it is somehow a far derived substance, yet somehow in line with that eternal basis; but so will I say, that of nature at least, or existence, that such mind is but a complex of nerves, electric currents and tissue; in the same way that the ocean is really just H20, and its motions are but a remark of the assembly of moleucles and their basis within mechanics -where motions are produced. 
   <br>&emsp;On one hand then, you have the critique of knowledge; not so much to do with its content, but the ledger of it, in terms of the form in which its proposals are made, and the strenght of their basis. That, and the histroy which contains this, and how this contrasts with periods later on. Besides this, sits the critique of definitions, and how a vast array of subjects are marshalled as pure substances, when in fact the factor being addressed is a complex of elements and motion itself. This is indeed a physical representation of the world: and the scale of ostensibility is what we use to diminish the confusion of things thought mistakenly whole. 
   <br>&emsp;Without speaking of these two topics, we cannot be affirmiative; for we will be both to apolagetic our declarations, and exhausted by our footnotes regarding baseless affirmations. Better yet, we suggest, and take things for granted; but we merely have stronger grounds to do so; and at that, such grounds humble our assumptions, in both scale and finality. For we must think, and at that ask from principled grounds. But so does such progress, when the principles are rooted in accuracy, have the means to iron out such principles. This is the inquisitive approach at least.
</div>
<div id="normsnearme">
   So the church is more specific a term than you'd imagine, for it represents the administration of christianity; at least, a portion of. It may be proper to use the term churches, in a general sense, but merely as an idea. In that, the world is home to many temples and synaogues. And all of these serve one primary purpose, namely the point of gathering in order to offer thanks and worship. 
   <br>&emsp;This is fine, as are most things. But, when these communions begin to color other parts of the world, and unduly, then there is an issue. For my choice to do something is mine alone, so long as it does not obstruct another. For my own sake, or the pernicous service to another, so may someone intrude upon me. This is fair in a literal sense, as laws exhibit themselves this way via enforcement. But while real laws are instated for the sake of civility and all its aims, the pressures of a religious person to live and be a certain way, under threat even, is not itself backed by law, but belief and personal feeling. 
   <br>&emsp;This is where the difficulty comes in. For those who freely live as they please, may in fact endow themselves into efforts which alter how civil action occurs. The freedom to worship is akin to one's taste in music, or to attend a public lecture, and at that being enriched as you will. But imagine if someone did not attend that lectur, and you attacked them because of it. If you felt that the lecture was beyond important, but essential, and that by not showing up you were harming everyone else, then so like an ordinary law, where the rules protect those from wrong action, and are enforced accordingly, so would one's feeling of a lecture being neccessary, and at that unlawful if not attended, yeild them a comaprable sense of enforcement.
   <br>&emsp;Now, not everyone understands their deity or religion in such abbrasive ways. But doth history lay. And in some weird sense, our inquiry, as it were, feels a sort of resistance, and at that shivering, as if some mysterious force were preventing our thoughts from becoming warm. This is so, for our ideas are not in fact reflective of both tradition and its offspring. The old notion of morality, in that, by speculation, it ought to be sourced from some principal good in the world, by whic we are moral upon compliance, and sin, upon not; so is this a antiquated view of things, based on many older assumpetions. That, and this method of thinking brings with it a sort criticism and or sophistry, whereby the elements of the tradition are made more scholastic. That, or people's concpetion of the world wraps around this: as if to find a better view of morality, or God, or physics: but such views tend to take the same assumptions. And those great men in Hume and Kant merely demonstrated that their are assumptions, and at that poor principles. And of their otherwise claims I care not to say, but only to remark upon the appropraite course for making such claims: which I would only say comes from reliable means of acquiring knoweldge, and our judgement from that.
   <br>&emsp;For the problem with the ancients is that their conclusions were based on false concepts. If it was so, that the fire god spoke, and said bow to me or be destroyed, then one's oblige to this seems sound; and those who did not were fairly convicted as threats, for the fire god would punish all. But what if there were no fire god, as one might imagine or dream, but rather an electric field, born of some origin and according current, and distributed its strands in all directions, twisting and knotting by its moving fashions, whereby the contents of the earth, life, primates and man came to be. And we know this now because we ask better questions, and give ourselves time to find better anwsers. But so is our past riddled with superstition and block headedness, born perhaps of fear and social apprehension. But whether in private, hiding from the mod, or the impassioned within the latter, so doth the roots of modernity lay.
   <br>&emsp;I, as a man, mean only to ask and think. The anwsers to lifes biggest questions feel either poorly described, by which I mean to better understand, or are simply unanwsered, and at that I wonder. But so in this latter lies a mountain of old thinking; thoughts which hold their soul as contrasts to the prior mountain of religious and scholastic sentiment. It least for me, little of what contemporary folks have done originally, or at least thoughtfully from these modern grounds, has come across me. In fact, in everyday life, and in most other areas, there lies little which I would describe as rich or 'great', when it comes to these deeper subjects. That, or they are unstitched together, or full of pedantry and stailness. 
   <br>&emsp;I don't feel opposed, as our civil lives have evened themselves out. But so doth academia lay, and most of it is interested in refininf individual parts: but there no tapestry lays. This is just for my own interest, as to furnish our aims. But the confusion of death, the ostensible view of the senses, the ignorance of worldy proportions, these all shine (dimmly or not) there normative lights, and at that, spark me, in our inquiry, to attend to such assumptions. For I don't mean to make things up: as our inquriy is not some private puruist tailored towards making our own language. I merely suckle at the tit of discovery, and the uncovery of the world's elements. But illustrating this, judging it, and at least wondering how it all works and breathes, is mere curisoity. And an intrigue of which remarks our dark sense of trepidation, as if the norms we otherwise wish to care, hold a smaller basis when the baser aspects of life orient us elsewhere. That is, we tend to think of life, and live by such inquiry; rather than doing what is traditionally done. But so in this deliberation, are matters of life itself, death, mind and such. For doing what was not done in the past, carries with it a sort of empty slot, when it comes to such subjects as they are taken for granted in the past. Death has a guise, as does the mind, and all the topics in the world. And in our inquiry these subjects gently lay. But so in our need to be more forth, and sure, do we see that our thoughtfull ends are not based on such brittle views of such topics. That is, we see everything in a vast sense, via our mode of inquiry; but while no problem occurs, so are we taking for granted such contents, as if the world is to big for me to care. But even though our thinking removes the bundledness of our mind, where some tragedy a 1000 miles away strikes us, so is our tender and broad view but unattended to such incidents, due to our mind's extent. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps this disocurse lacks what all our efforts do, an aim. But, I can say, or what I notice at least, is that we have a fair sense of our ignorance, and what cogs are loose enough for our autonamous conduct to feel somewhat wobbly amidst the norms around. That is the real motive. Not so much that we wish to show others the truth otherwise, 'in terms of how these topics are in a reaosnable sense'. But I just wish to live, to be, and such regards stands on a tender view of these topics. And to ignore them, feels like were fooling ourselves; or moving through the world at least in our striclty private way. Knowing the truth though, makes me on par with the crowd, and at that, above their own false commiseries: for I see how solid they are, and the minor extent of their unkindness. This is all a symptom of our own course of thoughtfullness; but so does this path not cry for a remission of its conduct; and despite wishing for it not to be so private, or without company while it personally focuses, so do the markers and wishes of such motions stay with me, while were calm even.
</div>
<div id="themysteryinme">
   So that is to do with the history of knoweldge, and our conflicting need describe death and what not, and the presumptions and or authoirty of the past melding in.
   <br>&emsp;Now, I'd like to mention the core source of confusion in the world, namely ostentation. As in all things, why falsity is poor ins one thing; but considering that it is, so is ostentation the cause.
   <br>&emsp;Simply, I say, 'how does such and such happen', so will we be less able to cooprate, and ultimatley harmded, but missssessing this and acting without fruits. This occurs when 'such and such' is taken at face value, and not what is in fact happening. These words rest on the presumption of our sense, which is its own can of worms. But consider a gas for a second, and whether it operates as a whole, or is in fact a bundle of smaller pieces acting amidst one another. Their relation is akin to the earth orbiting the sun, in that it is part of a system. But saying that their is a solar system is quite general, as would saying there is a universe.
   <br>&emsp;Ultimatley, the problem comes from an understanding of phyics, and how everything that is labelled, normally, is in fact but a differently complex assembly of real things. "Like a house of cards, which is in no way anything but a bundle of cards."
   <br>&emsp;The human error though, and where the nearness to modernity lay, comes when we consider our view of such deck, and how the house appears as such, despite it really just being cards. This notion is regarded as realism, in that things, ostensibly, are taken to be things in and of themselves. I'd say that is a reaosnable anwser as to why this is not so.
   <br>&emsp;Simply, our senses are part of nature, in the way that gravity causes orbits, so do our nerves respond to heat. There is an ignorance on my part as to how the 'phenomena' of expereince is made; but so can we clarify some of the motions which seem otherwise offical, as mere grooves of this assembly. For one, as a squirell is dextrous, compared to a fish, so is man able to speak, see, smell, hear, run, stand, mate, sleep. And the concept of thinking fairly sits as a operative status of those faculties. Thought is not strictly this, but the act of speaking, remaking upon something, considering death. These are all movements of an otherwise assembly: one which we can declare. And where the problem lies is in the doubts of whether or not such phenomena of expereince is in fact beyond nature, or is part of nature; and as touch is really a result of kinetics, and vision a remark of electric potential; or color even, in that it is but an overlap of receptors which remark color, so doth 'our consciousness' lay.
</div>
<div id="objectandbase">
   So theres two general ways of thinking. One, begins with a principle, or fact, and you reason from there. An example being, that nature is either part of or the equivalent to entirety, and by that, all things observed rest inside. On the other hand, lies such observations, whereby you derive no given principle about the world, out of neccessity perhaps, but simply describe the objects around you. Be it of the matrix, by god, or of nature I do not know, but the motion of earth clearly is that  of an orbit, rather than one who is orbited.
   <br>&emsp;In this latter case, the risk runs that you will not be admitted to think, due to observation being the only credible factor. Strange though, that hypothesis work in the opposite way, where you conjecture and suspect: but the merrit though is that such thinking is validated by observation: in that your suggestion of the way things work, must correspond to things.
   <br>&emsp;On that initial standing, there runs the risk of forgoing accuracy in objects, and letting your reasoning wiggle away. If I were Protagoras, I might say 'of all things, which is more perfect, a square or a circle?' And some may reply the latter (based on its uniformity). It is then said, 'and is the Sun not akin to such perfection, in being so round? And if so, does that not inbue the Sun with some quality of perfection?'.  This form of thinking has two flaws, though one is more obvious. That has to do with the accuracy of the object being subject to reason, the Sun in this case. As besides the parameters in question, the Sun is not in fact a circule; at least by virtue of its rough surface; while a real circle would (more or less) be smooth. And the sun, by these accounts, is to that degree imperfect. But the primary issue, and one which is not so easy to state, is regarding relevance, or soundness rather, in that, even  if the Sun were smooth and circular, would that make it eligble to slot into this reason'd argument. For by its accounts, circles are amonst the perfectess of things, by its uniform proportions at that -whereby it lacks all cracks and edges. But so in this argument does it imlpy, that all things which have any resemblence of such property which is found in the perfect object, must be itslef perfect: at least it must have perfection to a degree. And arguing that is much trickier.  For it would be overly simple and absolute to say that the Sun was perfect due to it be circular. But as circular as it was, how much should that imbue it with the quality of perfection? If a circule, being the host for what non perfect things are compared to, is an ideal form, and at that mark of perfection, then how much does some complex object which appears similar to such form, be assessed if such property it holds amounts to the whole of such object. Because at that, we could say that a sphere is even more perfect than a circle, due to its a volumous uniformity. "And who even knows, in that respect, what the sun looks like." 
   <br>&emsp;The point then, is that being reasonable requires an appropriate deployment of parameters, as objects will surley be run through them and accordingly judged, or fitted rather; but therein, do those objects need to be themselves assessed; for on a basis level, per one property  lets say, the prescence of such property (which is our scale) within an object needs more evidence then a surface level appearence: for accuracy may require deeper investigations. Moreover, as the parameters increase, in either quality or quantity, so do the applicants need an according depth of assessment. 
   <br>&emsp;In many ways denying that one's reasoning is sound is a pure trouble, for you need your own  reasoning to argue that their basis is off. But we can demonstrate what mature reasoning is like, in that Socrates, being reasonable, might ask what is the most perfect of things, and at that find his listeners believe it to be a circle; but at this point, he may then ask, 'and is there any holes in this logic, or assessment? Is the circle really an analog for perfection? And, at that, how ought it really be deployed in terms of a scale, as to judge other objects? Moreso, if we evaluate objects on such basis, are we doing them a diservice, at least when it comes to other properties they have which can be assessed? Ought we add more properties to our judgement'. Each one of these questions, by his method, would begin with a question, end with a listenere giving an anwser, followed by more questions. And while observations are set as the point which our reasoning is validated from, so is it the other way around when starting with reason; in that one thinks of parameters, principlpes and rules, that may fit the evidence at hand, while the other estbalishes such a basis, and either looks, or at any rate broadly evaluates, surrounding things on such basis. "By these principles, how do things comply? What are they based on such judgement." And although the basis for truth is hard to say, and at that reason is to hard to criticize based on its deeper nature; but so can we say, that if objects fit themselves to reasons furnishings, then so ought such furnishments be themselves aligned. And, by my accounts, there is no better way of doing so, than asking whether the ones we are using, or use presumably, are in fact so.
</div>
<div id="ourplaceinman">
   So Socrates, like all thinking men, did not partake in formulating the truth which was known -as to offer insight or widsom regarding it. Instead, he sought to understand what the truth was: and by that, he gained his reputation of asking many questions.
   <br>&emsp;Now, such an approach can draw scrutinous eyes; for if I say, 'justice is in fact this way', then immediately, your amends to the current of justice are thrown out. What new one's are to replace it is not the point, but rather that you are said to be wrong: for your respects are for something false. This is the basis for imposition.
   <br>&emsp;Still, beliefs come about when one becomes acustomed to seeing the world a certain way, and the required actions. If someone questions the former, so do the implications of what such critique denies, ruffle those whose beliefs are based on it. In other words, if one questions the nature of God, then it is all to easy to find that the inquirer is denying parts of his nature which seem just, and at that neccessary and or promising to attend. This is the basis for contempt, and the labelling of those uncompliant as impious, sinfull, frauds.
   <br>&emsp;The question then becomes one of motive. As our modern age does not shine such scrutiny: for the most part at least. But like Socrates, there is this urge to offer one's insight, in order that the apparent ignorance around is cured. Why this is so I do not know; for even if we could show how a free age without wisdom procurred progressive wounds, then we would still be left wondering why that is our concern. 
   <br>&emsp;I think it is better to state that our interest in being both open and helpful, is a mark of our lower impulses and higher reasoning. For we may not be so genuine in  the former, nor free from alterior motives in the latter; but so do we in our basest of regards wish well for others, and at that our means to support that. But I must confess that the form in which this 'altruism' takes is one of indolence and destiny, whereby the aid we might offer is more dreamt of than planned; nor do we lack self assurance as to our place in being so contributive; by my simplest accounts though, this has the wishes for more action and esteem swirling at the base.
   <br>&emsp;One of the problems perhaps, is that our freedoms are almost limitliess, if not but for the principle of the world. By that, we see ourselves as a citizen of the latter, but thereby kept to aims and cares regarding it. That being so, we remain someone reserved, considering the terrain were working on. And, deeper than our actual view of the world, sits an accordingly needed depth and regard for the principles which direct our motions. For it is all to easy to be overwhelmend by some foreign travesty, only to forget that the nature of good and bad does not rest on such common grounds. The roots of the world are our concern; and as those incidents or remarks of perril are but guisers coming from the depths below, so is our regard as a man centered on the core, and at that the account and mechanics of magma.
</div>
<div id="anaturalcourse">
   At the end of the day, life goes on. A contemporary mark, is that thinking, and things like it, are not seperate from nature, but akin to unequicable source of vision, so does our mind lay; and accordingly, our thoughts are akin to holding ones breathe, in excess at least. For nothing about the world changes other then the configuration that your thoughts are spurred to produce. The strucutre of this is not clear, but we can say there is one.
   <br>&emsp;At that, life goes on via natures current. And the point is that nothing is excluded from that, including our mind.
   <br>&emsp;What were left then is a natural course, neccessarily. But in that, lies the mysteries of the mind, and how it gets bogged down, obsessed, struck. But, like a memory, so does lifes draw on us give way, forcing our 'thinking' to cede to action. "For none are stubborn indefintiely." And from this occurs expereince, which our memory seeps up. And from that, our current strictness, has some knowledge of the likely course ahead. Not only that there is one, but that it will compare to what our past has shown. From this, a problem we currently have -and is compelling our mind- will surely be sovled; but, more importantly, the future we reach will still be one we are alive in, part of, proceeding. And from that, our grandest inquiries and despair, holds nothing but a momentary slowness within the constant state of progress. "Only, our particualr make ups are such, that action is pent up, then brought forth: like one who travels the globe upon their stilled construction of the wheel: to which space is the subsquent frontier."
   <br>&emsp;In this way, I can say that we have our prior actions, all which have led to our current point. In that past, lies the state of things around me (whence I came), and at that, asked for, recieved, pushed back, and at that, molded me for different kinds of action. "Gravity is a bich, surely: but I watch my step, because I know she'll make me fall down." And around this, lies what I can only be described as an exemption from antiquity, and all her productions; simply, perhaps, due to a fruitfullness which (in my youth) I merely recognized as stiff, tinged with rot, self obsessed, and otherwise disposed to what others had done before. My adolescence was ruled by an otherwise course of discrimination, if only because nothing 'common' was based from such; that is, reasons were seldom given, and of those which were, they were more like drifting garments, sown outside the matter at hand: but little of that core definition was stated. 
   <br>&emsp;Where I now stand, is in between a state of reflection regarding our place as one keen and diposed to discrimination (or examination), and a befuddled state which lacks friendship, romance, application or contribubtion; to which, our gaze settles on the entirety of things, if only by idleness. Yet, such a station is an old one, and at that, is grounded through peace and stability; to which, our choices are what have kept us from being practically defined, rather than our affibility or agreement to it. As our younger years saw much hate and cynicism regarding such things, as if they were both wrong and against us. But the local world is one that affords no hole in our freedom, and at that our choice of action. Time is still up though, at least I suspect so ultimately. And from that, our peace within discrimination, whereby our duties are finely dealt, leaves us in a place of content, and at that, merely aware that choices are what additional things are held by. But, as additions, they are onto one who, to some form and extent, is of the world, part of it, rowing with it. And indeed, I find truth in what I say, in that of our composure and decadence as regards such world, so doth our ignorance collapse from a lack of those additions -as remarks the width of our structure, rather than pure quality. 
</div>
<div id="whereilay">
   So, I'd say, with sensible might, that our view of life is such, that as a part of it, we are to some extent wide and peacefull, but at that still subject to, and otherwise prepped for the world. To long has reason and assent been fostered away, as if its aim was to make some new aim, one which was beyond the world. Yet the world is all we need: as it is our relevant strand of nature.
   <br>&emsp;Because of that, I see that the dialectic is really just a matter of progress, and our inability to remain at the current point, all the while reaching an ideal. For life drags us, spurs us, and in many ways, thwarts our sense of how our place amidst life should be. As it were, peace is what we ultimately seek; and personally, if gained, or conjured at least, so may we sit in the nearer parts of lifes current; and at that, foster a broader view of the world, as is both neccessary, and sufficient. For it is not so easy to see the world on the whole, and amend: or define at least. And one's situational peace marks the means to do that.
   <br>&emsp;Our thinking rests on the form of our thoughts, and the basis for such thinking. All things discourse and reason, one being a path to deliberation and our naturally according action, and the principles by which such disucssion rests on. "We are but primal folk otherwise." 
   <br>&emsp;So we lie then, humbly awaiting, gripping the matter of our ideal form. But so doth the approach to modernity lay, for she is still so gripped on the formalities and pedantics of the latter, and dishearted and pagented in the former. "Maybe those on the updraft of liberty, have the natural place of showing what the world looks like and needs, under such an influence. For none in stress see things clearly, or amend without haste. But so are we, of the developed world, and those wholly using it, the painters of such time, the architects, the musketeers. Lifes grip has ceased us; not only in the increasing success, but our perpetuity, and ease by which this comes by. Man hath no fury on his quest for shelter and food. Walmart, Wifi and heating have done so thoroughly. And maybed our honest belief, is that our liberty and strenght, ought carry us in responsibility and resolve, and by that, to our place amongst the world; and thus, to the needs which we individually can address, of which those who fight fires or deal with crime are of contrast. They treat the wounds of the worlds' inefficiency, while those uplifted by fortune and virtue, paint the rafters which draw up such roots, as to make them ironed out and lush. This is the product of modernity so far: but so does the vast ceiling of nature lay
</div>
<div id="aliberalpace">
   We could describe choices as those things which you debate; at least, you examine the terms, and decide. While a selection is some action which is done, guided by either impulse, or a prior decision. "As if I had decided that sugar was bad, and at that, fashioned myself to not select it."
   <br>&emsp;Now, considering the priamry relevance of decisions, so ought we base this on the field of choices we'd make. For granted sure, but we may say that there is a nature, that we are within it, and hold a certain part. In that way, all things may in fact be in total, but our words at least can refer to the motions of things. For beyond this integral point, we can say whether or not the universe 'is' or is of existence, or nature, so can we say, that there matter lays, and at that planets, land, continents, and civil regions (from countries to streets). 
   <br>&emsp;In order to remove confusion, we say, that our choices are based on the examination of nature, as to firther know her, and at that, direct our actions as to be agreeable. Besides our origins from her, we can say that our success, as all action is aimed, will come from the appropriate the steps: the mold being set by nature -the parts relevant to us at least. The crucial note though, is that our actions are like gas particles, in that, they act as such in that they are a certain way. And of that, so are we men, and at that animals, who, in need and nature, act accordingly. The point being, that we are bound to be and in that act via the form of nature: of which matter is neccesarily so, as much as it is something, to action. Something may be still, but not even rocks are without flux; their subject to erosion, the motions of the planets and stars, and at that the dispersion of energy. By that, the core strand of nature being all things, or something farther, I do not know: but we are at least within the domain of the former: we are members of the whole, or are pieces of some part of the whole: but within such domain are our actions claimed.
   <br>&emsp;Because of this, we need not marshal what will already happen, but instead be discurvive towards the factors which, in all their guidance, might be wrong. Man need not examine the heat of fire in order to know that it is not to be touched; nor does he need to reason upon his want of food. But if he wishes to achieve the fruits of society and organization, or the use of technology at least, ought he examine such elements, their relevant spots within nature, and how both relate. "That is what has made man so, beyond another animal, an ape. He's questioned, learned, grown, and from that birthed the structures which have born this liberal age. But so in that conduct and the consquent desire, does he often wobble; as the success of one thing makes him equally curious and resourcefull, but not neccessarily with an appropraite mind. That is why Socrates stated that justice and piety ought be examined; for the society in which they were put to use, albeit well formed and intentioned in its own right, had not defined the terms which would permitt it to grow further."
   <br>&emsp;Our philosophy then is one of liberty, in that whether our home is within the whole of nature, or a mere side of it, so do we merely care for, and at that derive knowledge of our being, on that side's basis. In a strict sense, this side of things is one of matter, and at that motion and continuity. From there, all things within such domain will act as their orgins bound them to; but we, via our liberty, need only concern ourselves with the fact that we are ones of such being, and at that ones who's core nature is one of motion. Inquiry can afford us insight into what we don't know, and discourse can discern the detaisl of such motions and their complexities. But seperating the mind and our 'higher' behaviors is not, by these tenants, neccessary or applicable. We need only be as reasonable as our portion of matter has reached. And, in that, we realize one soul rule, in that our rational regards are set upon the elements of the world we define; while our intelligence yeilds us the ripest use of them. "As our motions constantly occur, so do bias' and mistakes lead us astray:  when we go beyond our baser selves. But so, in this innate movment, do we need not usher it towards the truth; but rather, we must merely examine it, and our pace will turn its way."
</div>
<div id="wherelifeismade">
   So the world used to be such, that the root of knowledge was in the neccessity approrpaited to the Gods, and that questioning this, or any of the elements presumed, was wrong, and at that punishble.
   <br>&emsp;Now, the world is permivissive to anyone believing what they want. They cannot commit crimes, but our ideas and beliefs do not qualify.
   <br>&emsp;Where we lie then is in the peskiness of examining assumptions, but not proposing a truth. In fact, the route to such knowledge is not known. We learn more and acquire insight, but stitching it together almost always rests on assumption. 
   <br>&emsp;I wonder if this is not what philsophy is; and considering our evidence born from true investigation, that we could take for granted a few simple premises on that basis. It all leads to inquiry though for predictions, and discourse for understanding, all so our principles are truly aligned, and faciliative to our natural action. The anwser is not one that ceases all questioning; rather, we must see how the world is, and at that, foster an effective response. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps the truth lies beyond our final curisoities, and the false distinction between a preferable end and futile one. For my belief, is that if we understand what we were, and at that our life, and that such thing was part of nature and thus her flow, then we could understand that our present being is not part of some temporary state or flux, but rather some figure of nature's many waves. At that, as she ebbs and flows, so do we particulalry go. But lets not pretend that this form of eternity is not sacred if it has not 'misssapropritated view' , or that nihilsm is the proper resolve; for these feelings are born of belieds; at least they are bits and specks of our higher thought. That is, if I said a man was coming to attack you, you'd have some apprhension; but if I said that you'd die in a million years and rest for eternity, would you even blink. I'd say theres much preference in that. And so, your idea that the your life is either of the 'afterlied', and favorably such, or is otherwise poor and at that conducive to nihilsm, may admitteldy be true, or sound at least, but is a discrimante response no les: and ought we be thorough in that? For our examination of the motions around us and ourselves, and the principles derived from this, that lead your otherwise feeling of life to change, can lead to a conclusion which is based on equally defined terms: only in the case of the former, where your past definitions run against the contemporary truth, so can we examine those definitions, and at that, reach the greatest of truths: namely that death is not evil, but a promise of rest and tranquility. And that, from some liberal examination, you can attune your beliefs as relate to the rules which natures conduct is judged by, in such a way that is equally sound as such conduct. And there life is made.

<div id="theroadistand">
   I grew up in one of the most wonderful places in the world....British Columbia. In that land, we were given liberties like the rest, but amidst a landscape which can only be desacribed as green and gold. Not once, be it winter or some other moment of cold, did there ever lack any moment of cheer. As a boy, we ran through the brush, ducking in and out of creeks, getting into all sorts of trouble. And not but the perrils of everyday life could tell me that life wasn't a treat.
   <br>&emsp;But that time did into come about; at least, those perrils began to usher their strain. You see, life was not merely something to hold onto, or work towards. Rather, it was a defense, as if predators were always in sight: or sensed to be around the corner. And although my younger years did not fall prey to such constant guard, those around me, who I would at heart call dear, began to implode.
   <br>&emsp;You see, my mother and father were all but cruel and wicked. Their hearts poured over me and my sister, ceasing only at time's many frictions. They never hit me, nor did anything I'd consider wrong. But I do recall, with unrested sincerity, that their howls of worry and contempt left me with nothing but a hatred for stupidity. I don't know why, but all things common and accepted, be it for duty  or success, slid right by my reverant sight. I did not, in kindness, care for my grades, nor a job, or girls at that. These things were either forced upon me, and so my amends were from apprhension, or I thought things were dumb and without warrant. "Boys do this some times, or girls even, when they like another, but through their nerves say the other dumb, 'and that such interests are stupid'."
   <br>&emsp;At that, my life truly began. For upon the peak of my youth, were the rungs of life which I was prepped to bare. Only, I had not the stance, interest or mindset, in order to, or with any aim of, finding such success. I never quite failed, as living in middle class in this country forbids me from reaping so: but I did lose some things, namely the ability to make a friend.
   <br>&emsp;For the heart of this story is that, in averting myself from the common path, I had to find another. As it were though, our life had not oriented me, upon such situation, to turn to anything truly perilous, but 'unproductive instead'. I smoked and lounged, argued and whithered away. And from this, our time never became quite so negitive, and at that, not so positive; for we never hit unmitigabye lows, nor were pulled past the novelty of any situational highs. Our soul semester of college is a mark of that. Instead, we simply idled out, stilling ourselves into a place which lacked little, but had not, to which, dearly, we hewed the seems of our basic self.  To which I now lay, a man, garmeted with a decade of royal treatment. Yet, as all Kings, my riches do not give me but a hollow glow: for under that crown, lies one without peace to be on their own, nor any ledger of strong accounts, of choices which earned them a friend. 
   <br>&emsp;There is hope though. For most reason and gallantry sheds light on the literal riches of power and success, and all its false ends. While I, in our own state of lordship, must merely coallesque to the truth at hand: and that is the fact, that of this age of change, whereby I truly became me, that such a route was not deemed for all the foolish ends which thwarted my aims: but instead, to the truly near and dear gains, which I supsected and have claimed. "And for that I've worked towards. Becoming myself though held not itself the gain: and what life has simply tought me, is that being who you truly are is not itself the goal, but the requistie to being."
   <br>&emsp;And with much thanks I say, down such road I am.

<div id="ofknowledge">
   I think that prefacing our philosophy on the basis of knowledge is a strong position, for the elements of it can be rooted in the nature of their speculative form. And at that, we can somewhat state the importance of knowledge, and thus revere the proper form of it. And by that, with a mixture of our personal situation in such writing, and the otherwise liberal state within a largely agreed upon world -as drawm by examination- bears me a structure to extract some princples, and work from. This is where the mention of nature being soul, in that there are not many, and at that interpreations; and, of such case, the part of nature which holds matter may be nature itself, or all of existence; or it may simply be a strand. In other words, nature may hold something beyond matter; and at that, may have differeny regions, or unvicerse rather, of matter. In fact, the universe is the domain of matter, as thee or 'ah' universe. From this, we ought riggle a bit as to say, what it means for us if nature is not entirely within the realm of matter but beyond. But from there, we can remove a great deal of apprehension due to the advents of cognitive science and anatomy, where, in which ever manner or not, the form in which our mind and behavior takes, is of nature. And the key part, is that, if nature has some sort of base which matter rests upon, then sure, our mind is derived from it. But it is equally so as all other parts of matter (or existence); and, via laws of matter and, at that, how matter goes, and the otherwise principle which retains matter within itself, at least in regards to any of its structure, so does our mind equate. It is fair to ask, if exisence rests upon the soils of reality, but is more or less distinct, how such reality means for existence to grow. But as it were, our understanding of matter, is that is merely an arrangment of pieces, distributing themselves via the source of such pieces. From that, rocks may have destinies, in that their part within the current was born from natures push of the dominoes. But it is the modern case, that our cognition (and such elements) are not discrete portions of that baser nature inhabiting the material side of it. At least, as much as existence is brought forth and distributed via the whole of nature, so does such strucutre remark all that is contained; of which our mind is so, positiviely, but with a contradictory principle as regards an exhibition of nature in particulare to us, as our mind is concerned at least. 
</div>
<div id="paintportrait">
   So imagine a canvas, at least something with a nature who 'houses' something upon that. And in this, consider the canvas in kind, but through varied shapes and forms, like a strand, or (ocean) current. Then think of the paint, or that which is put, or at least set, upon the canvas. "Like red dye cast upon a string."
   <br>&emsp;Now, if the canvas is woven, like a strand, into some sort of form, so does this suffice to explain the world as we see: by the partcile and force nature of it at least. But even then, if the strands, however woven, did not create the entirety of phenomena, but were due to the colors of those strands, then so the world lay.
   <br>&emsp;I worry though that this idea is not reflective of reality, as in all fairness, there being only strands and not paint, seems the right portrait. For a few problems rise if it is otherwise. Namely, how the positioning of the paints, as respects the orientation of the strands, creates something which is not, in truth, better explained as the arrangment of strands. "Or in other words, that your not saying anything much, if some property of the strands is what creates what is better put as an effect consequent of the strands." It is worth mentioning the possible nature of the strands, and properties which we may consider may be as a result of the arrangment of strands, or has to do with the strand itself. And I would say there could be many strands, in kind at least, but so is it simpler to describe the supposed results with just strings. 
   <br>&emsp;Secondly, is whether or not the paints on the strings interact in and of themselves. This is where the trouble comes, as not doing so just leaves us with the strings themselves, and the color which we attribute is in fact just an effect of the string's arrangment. For it could be so that the red of one string and blue of another create purple, but where, beyond the strings, floating in the void of them? Or does it change the red and blue of the two strings into purple? 
   <br>&emsp;In other words, as regards wholes and pieces, there is a certain insufficency in explaining something by using pieces which have no place. But when you see that this can be said about everything, and that the simplest anwser is really what the 'colored' ones are derived from, its hard not to lean on that one. For the idea here, is that the world is not some substance upon a current, or strand, but is the strand. And the point is not to conceive literal pieces of rope, or to give any sort of body or defintiion, but merely illustrate the fact that nature is not a house to the world, but is the world itself. For the world as we see has much ambiguity and room for doubt, surely. But beyond our actual understanding and how the finest explanation suffices, you are still left with the issues of placing a weaving of existence upon some other sort of weaved basis, as each amounts to the same. How a soul nature exists, fully contained is hard to say. But suggesting that there are strands and paint is but a pairing of the core problem: which, in all fairness, does not suggest or invite the notion of there being anything but a soul nature.
</div>
<div id="relationtoman">
   So our thoughts breathe off of description and knowledge, for we have things to speak of, and the means to speak of them. 
   <br>&emsp;In that though, lies contrasts, or opposites when it comes to 'isms', such as nominalism or realism. Notable in this, is the notion of morality and panatheism, and their compatibility of an ideal form of nature which sits beyond the existence were part of; and as regards the physicality of the latter, so does it get imparted on, fundementally and or momentarily, by the former; and, at that, our idea of life, and at that the mold for amends, extends to such ideal domain. 
   <br>&emsp;Positively this is not so, as akin to Einteins ingenuity of removing the medium by which physics acts, so does it seem fair to presume that nature is entire in its whole, and at that not so seperate when it comes to the realm which we live in. 
   <br>&emsp;"There is much to do about knowledge, definition and inquiry when it comes to seeing and or describing such a unified world: but so humanity lays."
   <br>&emsp;I will admitt that our postive statement is not without balance, as we are indeed deriving some principle from observation, and also ignorning traditional principles that lack observation. That, and we otherwise suppose based on what is known; and indeed very little may be so, but so do the grand conceptions born of non-evidence hold little sentiment despite such grandeur. In that way, I am acting from the base of modernity, or examination rather. I think that the concerns which our principles are aimed at have much to take away from those who developed such sights in absolute ways. But the truth of the matter is, that of the world which they evaluated and concluded from, so were such conceptions ill  founded. "And their shortness gives some explantion as to why 'the absolute' was so ardently sought and reached: as litte examination prior was done." 
   <br>&emsp;In other words, I have the sense as to why nature is how it is based on a fair understanding of how it is described. And although our details are limited in scope, I do maintain a speculative composure, as to be general and unconvicted as regards our principles. As such, furthering our knowledge would afford a firmer base as to solidify such principles, and to our judgements, know. But our buisness in being otherwise is for me to deal with. That, and any scrutiny or suggestion as to some other world conception, which could afford firmer principles, appeals to me little. As I believe nature is one, and at that variable only beyond the truly verified parts, whereupon the ideas of nature show an assorted complexion. "But such sprouts of possibility are atop the roots of modernity, or examination." And as it were, those convictions born of primitive grounds hold no admittence by me, in terms of consideration, and at that selection. "For it is the mark of intelligence to remain postured in the face of uncertainty; and besides the lack of merrit, there is, in those ancient grounds, no value in settling -as if any conclusion would do."
   <br>&emsp;As a result, we are not measuring this modern take of nature against past rules of judgement. Those were very much dualistic in their conceptions, and resolves at that; which is not what the modern view prescribes. It is true that the form taken to be true in the past shares some resemblence with the modern form, namely in terms of the multiverse. But so does this, however comparable to that multitude form of nature, not neccessiate some cosmic deed towards the deeper part of that distcintion. In part at least, on the basis considering the need for some servicable submission to nature, and to some select part at that.
   <br>&emsp;Philosophy, in its truest form, is in relation to man, and his use of it as guidance along his active path. This may be something different than philosophy; but if so, then philosophy is not a prime concern. What is of worth is hard to say; for some begin with examination, while others act on innate principle. I would argue that the latter is born, to some minimal extent at least, by the former. And at any rate, the elements which the latter uses hold no substance if they are not themselves examined. I will not say that such objects of principle need be sourced from the world; but so much as they are, 'and gosh what farce has man in this case seen' that statements invovling such content need be appropriated. One could question the neccesity for an object of the world -within the use of a souly principle realm- to be defined by what it is in terms of the world realm: but I cannot submitt any thoughts as to how it would have definintion at all.
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, an idea which said that God, as principally known, and served, via actions as defined by principle and to an end of the sort, is perhaps the true lane of devotion to divine. If nature is one, or at least functions with us as  part of it and not something seperate, 'or seperated, and at that aimed to reach', then the divine is not a true conception. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, I have a real statement: and it is of pure pity. For I cannot say what is true, normally remarking a false or incomplete statement. "And a statement then which is not in fact entirely so, is not something I know: besides it being merely statementish." What I can say though, is that, as I, and all other people, are free to believe something antiquated, so am I at liberty to feel as though there is no divine, and at that, any value in thinking on pure principle; along with refraining from including world objects within such principle, but with no address how they (as world objects) are. As per my privaleg to believe, so am I at liberty to doubt: in this case, to the merrits and or ability of conceiving of something of the world, in a non world matter, but yet with some sort of form or identity not sourced from the world. "I am just not clear or able to see, how at that point anything can be concieved at all. For what is the reference, or idea, if not derived from some being? How is their red to a blind man?"
   <br>&emsp;There is a crucial matter though. For if I believe the universe is whole, and you believe it is seperated into existence and the eternal fold, or if I don't act on any basis of there being the divine, and you do, what does it mean for me to merely accept that you think that way, and to expect the same from you? Is that all there is to it? Permitting someone to have their beliefs? Because what happens when it is a matter or taxes, and we belief that seperate measures should be introduced. Or, if you have some resolve based on the divine, and I do not, what if that leads to abbrasive resentment. "As history has shown." 
   <br>&emsp;This may indeed be the core fact of them all. For why is it alright for some to be christian, but deny their children contemporary aid? Why is it alright for Catholics to live and breathe as they please, and by our accounts is fine, but to then remain accepting following the Rwandan genocide. It is fair to suggest that those involved were not acting as would remark being Catholic. But so the mystery lays. For disagreement is natural, and despite having seperate wishes, each party can usually accept the final finding; on the basis that the result was reached by majority. But what about stubborness, as might be found when one presents information regarding a certain topic, but such information is to related to other bits of info which they deny. I am thinking of geology and Geneysis, and how certain folk believe the earth to be a certain way. Which, again, is fine, and be accordingly. But what happens when one of those folk recieves evidence regarding climate change, and at that a request for action. "What if theres a mix of stubborness and denial, born from the dissmisal of the climate report, because the heart of its merrit compares to the merrit surrounding geological claims. Its not so much about seeming contradictory, but denying one on the care to admitt anything of the kind: the feeling of which comes from a conviction against the results born from geologies methodolgy: an approach which climate science is ingrained to." 
   <br>&emsp;In other words, how much are rights permitted when it comes to beliefs, when such beliefs lead to an infringment of otherwise civillay determined rights. It may be simpler than that, but it does seem, in way or the other, that by denying one the actions born from their belief, that you are saying their belief is wrong. For surely there have not been single members of communities who have acted beligerently on the basis of certain beliefs. And by saying no otherwise, you are in fact saying that you don't think their feelings are justified. As our world is structured in a way that exhibits that, but not always in the past. For the Pope literally told the Knights to go on the crusade and fight for Christ: he literally emplored them to rigtheous violence. And now, if you say to a man, that he cannot kill despite his righteous claim, you are in effect denying, or forbidding, the source of such claim; as you would otherwise permitt it, and by that validate such source. If someone says that God ordered him to kill someone, how could you say no, its God. But you do anyway. And depsite the meaning of this being more than a simple denial of God, so are you, in the manner in which the one denied feels about such (divine) command, that the merrits of it are off: and I can't help but feel that the denial of such merrits, denies (to an according extent) the basis which such merrits are plead from. "For it they were merrited, it would be because you admitted such base. And it seems hard to say, 'No, God is fine, but we just don't want you to listen to him in this case'. But he is all knowing, and holds the title of all mighty: of which we deem his word law. How could you deny it." 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps ultimatley, that those on the side of the divine, or those not, that denying one's wish to kill on some divine basis is perhaps a fairly presumptious statement, that the divine does not wish for so, and by that, the person (who feels their commanded) is confused -or mistaken rather. "It is just hard then to say whose right."
</div>
<div id="fullandgoing">
   When we say that nature is soul and entire, we simply mean that the world is continous, and at that evident. We may not have seen all, but we can discern principles and or expecatations based on what we have seen. "And the most important rule of life, is to base your convictions on the strenght of grounds for them; but, more crucially, that what you have seen is what there is, rather than some concession of what there ought be."
   <br>&emsp;In that way, our life is without concern for Mars or Andromeda, but of Man and the earth. In this way the structure of life persists, and we are at but a moment. 
   <br>&emsp;In that way lies the heart of all talks, namely the course for right and wrong, and at that justice. By this, we settle on the motions of governance, as a sort amends to such motions. Knoweldge remarks what such steps are inline with, while civil assemblies are the execution.
   <br>&emsp;In this way, lies the core confusion, namely of what remarks the means to such execution, and all the strands which it official (or effective/actionable), and the ancillarly force of change. For we are lucky to have presidents rather than monarchical kings. As one held all the notion of choice and change, while the former makes decisions equitable, which itself lays the groundwork for additions to stability. The times may not breathe such fortune, but at least it is fair. Change then stacks upon this official process; and not onto an otherwise structural whim. But the change is never to the complex which makes things stable and official, but to additions as to bring more life and substance to such solidity. By that, democracy is in regards to the decisions made, as to collectivley conclude which course and measures should be made. But that there are decisions, and at that ones notified by the executive, legaslative and judicial system, is not up for contention: potentially or of any ones interest. By that, I rest on the world being at worst the same, and dissapointengly not improved. But so do the specifics of this fall under a statistical analysis, as every individual can handle challenges differnelty, and appreciate improvments as such. "And as regards climate, foreign relations and domestic rights, so are these of particular proportions, and thus quite obscure to our judgement: but a lack of seriousness in how these are taken, on the whole of it, is not to be expected." 
   <br>&emsp;In any case, I will state that the world is fine, and at that ripe for or in need of change by some statistical analysis. And from that, it may be said that each particle of gas exhibits itself to every other member by virtue of its immedate relations, and the reactions which spurr from those. In principle this remarks how right actions are done, as you push a little and cause a cascading effect. But we can say, in all fairness, that the more volumous the gas, the less concentrated we have to be in terms of a single partcile, or motion. This remarks a sort of retreat from an overy ideal action, whereby a thin concept of the entire world is taken to wholly, and the according actions which are given way to much emphasis in being immediate. This accounts primarily for the world and countries. "That is, our princple can rest more locally, rather than presuming that we ought to be bold on such fronts. For who could change the world, and not their own town? Yet such a choice feels so less drawing, and at that ingrained via hard facts; all of which paint a very procedural and systemic route."  
   <br>&emsp;With that in mind, we may consider the needs of communities within our proximity, and at that, ignore the pleas and passion of overly thin world pursuits.
   <br>&emsp;I think that anything besides that is akin to a painting, whereby you look at something, see it, take something, and then bring it back to the relevant parts of your life. Such relevance may extend to your town or region. And we ought see things which are commercial, advocate, advertising, shrude, ignorant, charlotan or ideal, for what they are. And as for their contenious place amongst the real world, rest on the statistical principal, and the mitigation of doubting whether such 'expression' hold merrit; or at any rate, if they are so 'condensley' heard. For in a world only conciveved by statistics -by people on mass- so does such principle not suggest those expressions are heard unanimously, through any real collective, or serioulsy even. "As such expressions paint a world beyond the one relevant to peoples lives, and thus peoples cares are proportional to that. They may find interest in what is said, or be concerned with what their shown; but so are they then spurred to contribute from their personal level, reaching as far as they can; that, or they are impassioned, and effected as such as regard their behaviour: which is a matter local and or private to them."
   <br>&emsp;So given the statistical nature of the world, as we can remark at least, and the removal of fear regarding people who act more declartively, what ought we personally do? Better yet, what ought anyone do? Because maybe the truth is that I live in place which has no grieving need for me to contribute. And because of that, I am not inclined to contribute at all, for being in our relvant strand of life, and it being fine, so are happy to be. One may advise us to look beyond ourselves, and at that look for other strands of life which are in need: but we'd then only be helping those within that. Indeed I can do that, and part of our fineness within our functioning part of life, may encourage me to do so, if only to do something more involving and important. 
   <br>&emsp;What I would say, is that of normal things which I personally attend, so does this widen my mind, and at that my near sight. From this, comes interests and oppertunity, however fairly based. And weirdly, I can say that from such sights, following efforts which truly cleared my mind, that I hold onto such scenery, and at that the actions which keep my lens clean. This is where guilt comes in, for we are so bent on our own expereince, that any idea which suggests we ought contribute somewhere else, has me in reserve. Again though, the impetus to contribute is more bent on the natural care to treat what is relevant to you, and the mere positioning of that where any place of relevance is in need. But as one who is occupied sees not but their requirment, so do those free seek further obligation, as to move beyond the emptier pace of freedom. But the ethical, or quality commitment, whereby one is drawn out from their life of self control, to expereince the greens of virtue, so in that does liberty lay. 
   <br>&emsp;In other words, those who are free and merely exempt from duty and deed, and at that open to apply themselves. While those at liberty, are such as to be where they want to be. I guess the emphasis of discourse ought centre on the mold which one of freedom may not have, and how contribution may seem an eligble anwser (for them to do something). While liberty is born from virtue, or self treatment, and the pure interests which it excites. How anyone every reaches this I cannot say; for it seems almost natural that, in life, considering its obligations, that our slightest excess above this would amount to treating with those who were in shortcoming. And at that, how would anyone ever come to the sentiment that their own attnetion was important, in terms of things beyond their basic needs. Why would temperance be concieved, or reflection, determination, or quality? Life perhaps would had to have been very free for such things to be cultiavted. My sense it that literature is what spurrs this, as such ideas are found nowhere else. And, to some extent, literature and devotion go hand in hand, and at that come through the peak times of civilization (relatively) -which we moderns are digesting. 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, I'd say that the war of men through the recent centuries is merely born of divine roots, and the modern reproach from such conceptions. First there were the inquistions, then the european wars, followed by the conflicts between Britain, Spain and France. Then there were the Franco-Prussian battles, leading into an entire European war...twice. And through the advent of that, slithered the apprehensions of the victors, due to their previoulsy gained power. There hands remained hesitant though, and suspended not but through the middle eastern conflicts, and some otherwise niche affairs. For whatever reason, the governments of the world have come togther, operating together on efficable grounds, and to an increasingly generous degree. 
   <br>&emsp;In this way, literature is the bearer of conflict, for it instills within folks conviction, and thus a brace against those otherwise read. This may be driven from prior conduct, but so do such motions find their legacy in writing. And what I'd say, is that as this war has gone on, so have accessory pieces been brought along, to which virtue has been claimed. By Plutarch and Seneca, Montainge and Spinoza, Hume and Kant, Emerson and Nieztche, and all the nearly modern greens;  so have we not been brought down by the broader engagements, but become in fact well read. And indeed, it is wise to know, and at that not give in to what you don't understand, as to the broader routes in which literay disagreement takes; but so does virtue born of literature remark what a man without enemies or chains ought do.

<div id="civilaction">
   So virtue has to do with action, and those amidst other people. While morals are centered on duty, responsability, service. On one hand, the more equitable a community is, the less duty calls, but virtue. As your actions are more bent towards accepting what offered for the sake of all people. In that, virtue is a love of other people and the governance which supports them. Better said, virtue is an understanding of needs beyond oneself, and ameliorating the wants and needs which equalize that. On the other hand then, morals remark what this society actually needs from you. Virute, as said, is not so much a gift, but an acceptence of the world at hand, and disposing yourself to that. "As if your simply waving a different flag." While morals remark the service required of, per your country. In this sense, I see how an economy remarks such a land, and considering everyone has needs, so ought they be met through such system; as most folk do, and at that benefit from everyone participating; while stealing and or nepotism sidetrack the whole affair. Per the stage of a democracy, prior less democratic functions will see future disparities, and at that privalage. But so ought we use this well. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps the problem is one of action, for just as people achieve resources to meet their needs, so do they reach for actions if their freedom is above this. Our liberty was garnered through literature, and at that cultivated. But acting from it has always been a hard thing to do; and the treatment of virtue has often been our goal, as opposed to any then grounded action. Without action, we seek it. Thus our minds querry as to the proper path through the world. I think that overall, the right system is one where everyone wins. But even if it were a lopsided one, so a system it would be; and partaking in this may not mean more than holding your personal post: meaning that you don't whither yourself away, nor take away others. In that sense, a firefighter is being as sericeable as a state offical, as they are both spending their time in a serviced way. Maybe its wisdom which alights the mark for your generosity. But so is this but a wiggling path away from self destruction and luxury. For you may be guided to a family, and a cash register. You must merely be yourself in the society, but fully. Not based on the asks of such society, but the need of it: which is that you would let the harvest be equally spent, and that you would not thwart the system for your benefit: nor that you would take part in suicide, or despair: for losing you there tugs on us all, and otherwise sulks at even a single missing piece. In democracy it is the more the merrier.
</div>
<div id="lawofnations">
   The Law of nations remarks the relation of governments between others, or countries between others. Politic laws remark the structure of local governments, and their relation between the govenors and governed. While civil laws remark the relation between citizens. Murder is a matter of the latter, while the right to a trial is a mark of the former. And as regards the first, victory through conquest for the aim of preservation may be the deed of one nation over another. But so does time allay, and yeild more harmony between nations. As it is best, in war, to do the least injury in order to achieve victory; while in peace, to do the most for one another. On top of this, within the nations realm, lies a somewhat obscure, yet standard, array of departments and or institutions; those being either private by citizens, govermental, as in the department of agriculture, and public, in terms of some civil affair.
</div>
<div id="thecollective">
   So man in his basest state follows no law or custom, but his whims. Civil laws then make his society function, and fertile. But natures law draw some other side of him, as if the ebbs of time are being amended. 
   <br>&emsp;Liberty describes someone able to do as they please. And indeed, leisure, pleasure and activity fall in this line. But it is important to note, that this sort of liberty is not a mark of freedom, but natural amends. As one may be set in a civl state of the world, and bound by it. But seeing as such a state is aimed at offering someone their needs, then so upon this being met, can they attest to the laws beyond that, namely the goods of reason. For the beauty of the sky or the peace from reading, are not things which come from the societal aims of food and shelter. Such things do abide by natures laws, but as respects the baser concerns we share. While liberal goals, or interests, are born from an excess of this, whereby we don't merely respond to such nature as to better serve or needs, but to see her, and take her hand. 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, soceiety is aimed towards the happiness of its participants, while liberty is aimed at the joy of ones life. In one, we act through reason, and govern ourselves as to efficeintly meet our needs. "If our extraction of natures stores is equitable and thought out, then we will all flourish." But imainge, if we had no needs, nor any reason to fear. What would we do? In other words, why are colors appealing and grand structures. Why do plays intrigue us, or music; or the wonder of science and history. Why is there fun. For you might think, like a cow, that if our needs were met, then we'd sleep and settle. Yet man has this impetus to culture, as if a complex which marks the sights born of our excess.
   <br>&emsp;In that way, one ought know who they are as respect the society their part of, and at that the measure of needs. While culture is a sort of interest, or care, as if one was secure enough to see freely, and at that be drawn; spurring then our dances and stories, writing and tales. Culture does not reassure us or give us relief, but moves by our purest draw: like one's pleasure upon sugar occuring naturally.  "I just don't know though how much I should care about our dance, when the ability to do so is born of our own freedoms, while others may not have so: at least we are ignorant of how we are even supposed to be, and thus whether we are doing it."
   <br>&emsp;If I am a citizen, then my will is such as to be in line with constitution. How this ought change, I do not know. But I see how our place in life is somewhat consequent of such affairs. In some sense, my will being out of line brings with it punishment. But in the case of violence or theft, if I do not do these things, willfully or not, then so am I in line with the constitution. There are indeed things that such statements require of me;  as I need satiety, and by that, of what I earn to acquire it, some must be submitted for the public good. That, and if the country is under threath, then the public good may require service. And indeed the state of country and its relations will make this a higher demand. I would say however, that a mature democracy is one which has equally democratic neighbours; at least, one who is able to care for all its citizens, likely is not oppressed by others whose actions don't reflect that. At least it seems fair to think that conquest is not required for the needs of your citizens to be met. "Less you aim to destroy, and at that add to your stores." Nature has given all, and governance is merely an arrangment as to deploy our efforts for the gain of all. "These lands, led by a sort, will feed those led by such sort." In many ways, the conflict we see in the world comes from the uneveness of those still 'undeveloped'. For developed countries, with some exception, care not to conquer and command, but to bear sufficiency for their inhabitants. The question, is what are those inhabitants to do. For they cannot murder, rape or steal; nor can they particpate in the path to their satiety, and not tribute something to the public. For the prescent of roads, medicine, power and services is not what the country affords people to instate; rather, it is something provided for them. Some of these may be possible in the private sphere, but roads for instance are a mark of the lands, and at that property, of which a government is a standing body around. "Or a mark rather, for such bounds."
   <br>&emsp;I cannot help but think from our current state. And by that, there is not conscription, nor anything but the request of taxes; along with any restrictions regarding civil interaction. And at any rate, that my pursuits, in the way they are made, must oblige the law generally, and in ways particular to such pursuit. "Such as a buisness license." If the government means to serve all, and is not unequitable in terms of class, then all any citizen can do is accept their standing as one's of equal standing, and by that appreciate what is given, understanding that any lack of privalge is due to the equity given to others. But then what, are we free to make do, to learn, share, create? These are marks of oppertunity, and fruitfull by the value created. "A fair exchange, even if one exchanges with many and thus grows in equity." 
   <br>&emsp;But where does virtue lie truly beyond the collective need? Perhaps our time bears ignorance to such appeal, for there is no apparent war or local famine -despite there being some impoverished. But there are folk lacking, if only from the dynamics which an less mature democracy produced. But so civil service lay, and legislation at that which makes private pursuits more equitable -the minimum wage. But if I am not a servant acting on such behalfs, or a higher official working on legislation, what am I to do as one of those men subject to such affairs. Perhpas we are lucky as to be unburdened, and at most guilty of our fortunes, and not their actual shortcoming. For in such an even state, I notice where I am personally lacking. As if upon finishing my buisness, I notice a wound in my thigh. And indeed this insight bears much life and means for generosity; yet for where I do not know. As singing and or dancing is hard to do, nor poetry with much difference. Seemingly I could, as I wish, contribute. Yet in such direction I do not stand. Our choices are not making such efforts available; at least, theres a future which I wont deny. And I thought of this some time before, that our need to move and the hesitation which I see, is really a remark upon you and your wish to act as would be good. And from that we are not so happy or with joy, as we are unactive. 
   <br>&emsp;The question then, is upon your move to Pitt, and the further move to something of stability, what will you till then do? For games are games, and movies and shows alike; but what is your course, goal, direction? For I feel without one, and our wonder and joy has nothing to live beside. I could learn more, but it all feels like were making it easier to be inactive. "As we feel guilty and ashamed to be so." 
</div>
<div id="subjectandthought">
   Two things: the subjects of thought and their validity, and the nature of validation. On the latter, I mean the conceptualization of phenomena to be then used in formal thinking. If I say 'the dog is blue', and then I mean to speak about such dog, I ought know what it is, and the property blue at that. We might say simply, that identifying the elements which we wish to interprate, understand or evaluate is critical, or essential rather. The risk is one thing, but it is another on pure valid grounds, to say that something has a certain meaning, when in fact such thing is not so. "That round object is dangeorus, yet there appears only a square: where is the danger."
   <br>&emsp;In this way, we can say, that observation is the material for thinking. Abstract objects may differ, but so is it akin to Hume to say, that the complexion of such abstraction will be born from real impressions. At any rate, the observations we make are akin to relations, whereby we see one thing here, and then it goes there, and how other objects around it compare. This is the nature of laws, in that things act a certain way amidst other objects. 
   <br>&emsp;The domain of relations is a system. Namely a universe, a galaxy, a solar system, a planet. But so are organisms of the sort, and atoms at that. "Even particles and their surrounding forces may be mere arrangments of baser fields." And what observation does, is track the motions of such elements. We may ask where they come from, in origin and end, and at that what they mean, in total and for us; but so must we not confuse the subject of such treatment; for systems are not things, any more than a sholl of fish is anything more than a group of indiviudal minnows. "The latter being the true subject." 
   <br>&emsp;And in general, the era of science has broken off of ancient thinking, in that the subjects for judgement, or meaning rather, are not the meager concepts of earth and man, but particles. That, and all their effective systemization of once thought whole things: namely the mind and space. 
   <br>&emsp;In any case, Christianity was a pure development for man, as before all the beliefs of peoples was polytheistic: while the Christians saw a soul God. But just as I would not be refuted for not subscribing to the principles and or judgements of cave people, so am I not keen on the fashions of Christianity. Not because of their complexion, but their core; as the basis for them is not valid. There are apolagists, but there merely fitting a round peg into a square hole. And as the Scholastics sought to formalize the Christian doctrines, and before that the world was evaulated on the Christian understanding, so is the contemporary understanding the basis for our current evluations. And I see no reason why this is not a mere advancment of the contempary nature of Christianity at the time. Were all searching for the core of Nature, and at that the knowledge of what it means; as the former is further discovered, ought the latter change? I am simply current.
</div>
<div id="crumbsofthepast">
   All of our problems come from facing nature. In terms of what we need, competition, relief, these all surround it.
   <br>&emsp;But we think little of this, and unfortunately do not know when we've won. 
   <br>&emsp;In the past, poverty was not marked by a lack of bear and meat, but bread; and if they had so, then food was no longer a problem. And indeed, we worry about the means for such bread, but only that. 
   <br>&emsp;When I was younger, there was no advice given for such sakes, but rather the oppertunity we had. As the world was, we could take hold of it, earn more. Moreover, because such advice was born from prior mistakes, so were the new oppertunities seen as dear. "And we were told how oppertune they were, given the troubles to come."
   <br>&emsp;But in such a world, one which held such supposed means to relief, I already felt we had one. For the concern was not so much our ability to have home and bread, but vacations and goods. Those were the costs you see: new clothes, scumptious food, a back yard which we never used.
   <br>&emsp;And my feeling is, that although we fear no tigers, but still live amidst duties and demands in order to be safe, and that our time is otherwise open for us to promsingly be, I see both sides of these unchecked by any sense of security. "As if we had become prince, but were then under threat of not being king. Indeed, such a venture, despite the freedom to pursure, would hold its own demands: but as men, have we not already won?" 
   <br>&emsp;For it is one thing, as was often mentioned, that a boat could be purchased if you had a good job; and by that, the good of it is being professed. But it is another to say, that such a good job will remove the struggles of living. 
   <br>&emsp;But there is something missing; as if there are to many false assumptions. 
   <br>&emsp;We ought start with the basics, before we get to preference (or liberty). For indeed, the needs of food and bread sit atop of basic safety, in that we need air, and water at that. And as becomes cars, housing, education and what not, so are these, as means of progress or results, oriented around such basics.
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, we could describe our lives as rational when we've given up on simply reacting to the world, but acting with respect to some sort of understanding; that it works in certain ways, and at that yields us certain results based on our actions. The promise of agriculture is centered on this. And, seeing as agriculture is an organized effort, so ought we oblige. 
   <br>&emsp;In that way, our surival is always one of maintence, in that we are somewhat alert in order to run, or hungering in order to furnish our bellies. But when the basic need of food is met, so do we hover, as if the limit to our success is based on our own capacity, rather than the chances of supply and hunting. 
   <br>&emsp;This sort of success breathes oppertunity; or excess rather. As not all are in need of standing around, watching the grass grow. For food is not the only concern, but also water and shelter. I will permitt myself to conflate two aspects -since this notion is from a time ago- but the sentiment of housing, urban structure and governance, all come together as neccesarily motivating factors, along with those which procurre it. This is the anthropoligical form amidst natures basic demands of us. 
   <br>&emsp;Modernity has presented us with a bounty of goods and services; but they do cost us, or require something of us. And certiantly, these things are beyond our needs. And it may simply be so, that the prices of all these things corresponds with the price of all the things we need: as we do not barter for home and bread, but otherwise pay for pedicures with coin. All are part of the economy, or a system of exchange rather. And indeed, it is hard to bring together the production of goods, the paid labor to produce them, and the purchasing of these and the according tax, and the government spending and creation of services and structure. For one seems novel, in that we make wool linens and purchase them: while the government pays for education and medicinal research. As one's security amidst tigers opens them to the fear of a deeper mortality, so does the satiety of our bellies open us to the mending of illness. But the ethic is surely to make do with what you have; and at the very least hope for, and contribute towards, the development of goods which will further that. 
   <br>&emsp;Antibiotics are likely not possible (in their specified form) without the general assembly; which is itself motivated by the production of other goods. But still, entreprenerus are like the government, or core contributors, in that they see some want in the world, and invest themselves in order to fill it. A modern effect of this is that those involved see the profits available rather than the novel goods on offer ---investors, corporations. 
   <br>&emsp;I would make the point, somewhat faintly, that in the past, the advice of parent's was not to become a doctor or banker in order to have the benefits of such job, but to dearly provide for their families, and otherwise meet their needs fully. At least the sentiment was one of neccessity. But now adays, at least when I was a boy, such needs were seemingly a given, and the real suggestion was towards a profession with more novel benefits; at least, with the perks of being able to afford nice/fun things. But I saw, or at least was not so motivated amidst negativie circumstance, to discpline myself for such ventures. As their neccessity was never in place, and so I did not reverre them. Nor did the basic economics, over time at least, warrant a special regard for the future needs of others: for their own needs would not fail to be otherwise met.  At least, their needs were like mine, in food and bed; and as I cared little to work so hard (under stress) for a boat, so did I not place their own values as being such. And as it happened, so much goodness in my life came down to the activites I partook in; and these were of a recreatonal or leisurely sort, and at that not very demanding in terms of anythign but our time. Everything esle 'was real' under the rustic lense of old. But I saw little of it as anything but something good, rather than neccessary. Nor do I even see it as that good now.

   Systems are collections, aggregates, bodies of entities, which are themselves actual, definite, objects. 
   <br>&emsp;If we are talking about the former, we use statistics, in that the terms we use remark the aggegrate motions, such as those in a gas. While the motions of an entity are remarked through dynamics, in that we use terms to denote how it is exactly. 
   <br>&emsp;There are some concessions when speaking in this way, as referring to a system, such as the world, can hold no real weight or substance if (it being a system) it is not spoken of in such broader way. We may condense or summarize it, making it more of an entity, but so must we bring with that an according depth. And in part, we could distinguish the many systems within a broader one, and by that, have a system which is itself more defined. For instance, we speak of Man as an animal, and use anthropology to remark his historic happenings. Man is a system though; but in speaking of him definitively, we can address him as an entity. In terms of a gas, we may be definitive, but in a mere statistical way. In fact, it might simply be better to say, that statistics are a way to define a body of entities in relation to one another. 
   <br>&emsp;A trciky notion comes though, in that as we go broader and broader, the term everything, universe, entirety, existence and reality come to par. And this is an odd sentiment, as the aggregate of elements into a broader form is generally not something itself; at least, when we speak of it as it is, so are we doing so at a surface level; for the subject in question is in fact large in comparison to more basic things. "Molecules for instance, hold more basicness than tissues, but so are these more systemic than the particles which create them."
   <br>&emsp;And it really comes down to a universal principle. Imagine a soul piece of fabric, a wave, a body of mist, and how little ripples create discrete points, which by the rippling, produce relations between such points. Here, aggregate motion is made, and systems at that. But, in truth, there are no systems by this model, as it is really just the basic pieces acting amidst the other. The mass of this is only ostensibly so. "Fusion, for instance, binds atoms, and at that creates diffent kinds of atoms. But so do the atoms constituents remain." 
   <br>&emsp;So there is this confusion regarding the base principle and the subject of its aggregation. In part, the source for such aggregation, via the principle, is not entirely clear are easy to parse; as the motions of such princople, or whatever causes such aggregation in the basest of ways, is not something which seems plausible via something inherent. One way of describing this is by removing the 'seeming form' of the world --and not being tricked into thinking it is itself definite-- and considering, to the best of our ability, how base we can be in terms of the relations happening. Doing this with physical science is actually not so hard, via the modern understanding at least. Indeed such base it itself not understood; but via our method, we remove the explanation of birds, planets and iron, but rather particles and their constituent waves. For the aggegration of those is not itself misunderstood, in terms of how its derivations are made from such: all that is unknown is what births the derivation.
   <br>&emsp;I mean not to linger, but as we speak of the world as an entity, or whole, so do we speak of the princples output in terms of sensation, and how it, in terms of a seeming expereince, is produced. For me, this is the hardest question to anwser. For none can have there finger crushed and not feel pain. And even though neurology can describe the mechanism which produces such, why there is 'an experience, or feeling rather' of pain, is blankedly hard to tell. I'd suggest, as vision is best viewed under that 'basest' of lenses --whereby we appropraitely describe what we actually mean-- that so would pain and pleasure be best put under such treatment. When it comes to vision, I can describe light and its interactions with people, and at that, the granularity which the brain is subject to. And even though in that case, the actual seeing --however in reality it is 'effecively' composed (as not to seem, or be granular)-- is not itself known, that the composition of pain is not understood. By me at least, for neuorlogy can indeed describe it, as light mechanics and the eye can describe vision. The expereince is equally unclear, but of what, only one is definite. "The mystery of pain is a mystery of something I don't thoroughly know: while the mystery of vision, is in fact a mystery of something which I can fairly explain."

<div id="properdeeds">
   So a man is whoever exhibits the characteristics deemed worthy. And such worth, from the core of it, is born from our relations with nature; in that she pressures us, and thus asks us to be a certain way. “Surely the character which we remark as good, is one which yields success.”
   <br>&emsp;The question though, is in terms of the progress of virtue, and how the ‘pleas’ of nature become further known; or there are new ones. For it is easy to ascribe one’s property within a function as the mark of virtue; the classic example being the purpose of a saw, in its actions at least, and how being sharp was a measure of that. But in that case, what if we were cutting different material, and different qualities of the saw were sought —in durability for example. The framework of virtue stays, but the statement of fact, or inspiration for the measure —the draw for virtue- changes, and thus which virtues are in demand.
   <br>&emsp;I say this, because like all animals, Man’s earliest ventures were one of heat, water and food. Transitioning from there to the needs of governance is a tricky task, as the process of technology and the means of using it is not easy to say. For we need at this point some marker of discovery, or principle which explains man’s acquisition of further functions. Better yet, an understanding of the world in terms of her opportunities, along with pressures placed by her which we did not know. That a volcano was a threat is perhaps something for an animal who is cultured and prone to tales; while God and salvation is a mere extension of that.
   <br>&emsp;Indeed our own inquiry needs more exactness in order for its general use to be proper. But we might say, from this point, that man has a function via the request of nature; which we might say is motivated by man’s needs, of which nature advertises a remedy. “The very fact that water may be in an unknown area, portrays the difficulty nature imposes -in the sense of lands and distance. But so does someones ability to navigate, and in tangent with that acquire direction (via smell in this case), reflect an possession of virtue: literally, by virtue of their ability to succeed. “A challenge sets, and those with virtue are relevantly effective.”
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps we could give some duration to what’s being said, and consider the difference between animals and men, in that one has not quite ever succeeded, while the other reached some point of success: and from there, furthered. 
   <br>&emsp;Indeed it is a matter of mechanics and definitions to properly state the developments of such success —as evident, via archeology for instance, and in principle, as in the general progress through various forms of tech and culture. Right now, our general principle is one of virtue and nature, and Man’s evident success as the one asked by the latter  to exhibit the former —i.e, effective traits. But as mentioned, the actual steps this partake, needs more exact principles as to generally speak of man in more detail. Broadly speaking, he initially succeeded and went from there. But of what initially point and why, and through each subsequent point, doth the depth of inquiry lay.
   <br>&emsp;I will not speak of such things specifically. But I will orient this baser depiction. That is, considering man’s early successes, as homo even, the common property of such success is that it was pre-ancient. I admit this is a blank term; but I say it if only to preface what I will now explain. Pre-ancient means that advancements are not cultural, but techonocligal. This itself may not fully demonstrate what pre-society is, but so can we contrast the two with the assessment of our place amidst nature, and whether we are simply maintaining the necessities that we already have (in method and extraction), or if we are simply improving at getting by. For animals never succeed, as they at best survive in order to procreate, then die. Their always in struggle though. At least, they never have any means but to try, and hopefully succeed. And man may indeed have been like that. But so much as he was, was he an animal; while his developments which gave him more ‘concreteness’ amidst those troubles of nature, makes him less so. 
   <br>&emsp;At this point however, comes the need to describe the transition between technology and culture. For one is made through excess, while the other is at best sufficient. If you imagine wild animals, their quest for food is always perpetual, in that they only have what they achieved that day, and have no definite means of succeeding again. Technology is man’s advent in order to revert that, whereby they acquire more than a mere instance of resources; or they have reliable means to get it again. By that, man became steady, or increasingly at least.  And from that, inch by inch, society lay. 
   <br>&emsp;The point I wish to make, is that as man acquired the first inkling of excess, so did the notion of ‘management’ come to be, as to better acquire such success (in quality of the means, and reliability of execution). But so did the question of ‘other’, be it near or far, come to be. If you could imagine, such excess, proprtioanlty, affords a slight amount of attention to be spent elsewhere. “Or not on the success at hand.” And in this state, lies kingship, belief and discovery.

<div id="homeandbread">
   So nature is a certain way, as are we. We ought not define either of those yet, entirely at least. Let us start with our observations, and at that experience; for the pain and pleasure I feel right now is quite indicative of what I should attend; at least, if I am injured, then what sense do I even have to wonder if something else should hold my amends.
   <br>&emsp;What we mean then, is that we have basic needs, namely food, shelter and water. And nature, making such needs, has been kind to incorporate her own being within our design, in that she has given us the tools to situate ourselves amidst her promising ways. In that, the means to success lies in our dance with nature, the virtue of which lies in how we take such steps. Doing so well, will yield us what we seek.
   <br>&emsp;But as we become ingrained to such motions, so does the trouble of warmth and satiety pass. Our care for it lasts; but our struggle in achieving so wains. As this happens, we open ourselves to other troubles nature presents;  or we apply ourselves to our current means, and make them more lucrative and accessible. 
   <br>&emsp;If you could imagine though a group of stranded people who have barely enough to survive, that despite their current state, that no stability lay. In that, there are but moments of satiety, but no sense of future security. It is the transition from this state within early man to one where his concreteness in the world is established, and he is no longer fleeing from tigers, nor clambering for scraps of food. In that lies management, as the perpetuation of such success is in need of more than a useful tool, but one to wield it; both in skill and employment. Admittedly, this age is not fully known to me, and so the extent to which this ‘managerial’ process took place is not entirely clear. But there is a distinction between ‘cultural’ troubles later discovered and the management of that. 
   <br>&emsp;In a way, people who gathered food were amongst those who could build shelter, find water, fight assailants and so forth. And as such, so long as kinship was present, so would the form of it surround such employments. As it were, as these were all duties and tasks, the matter of there being such things became an issue itself. For a group did not merely have to employ their members for the gain of resources, but had to orient themselves so that employment itself could be had. Because as further duties came to fruition, so did they get covered by the same organization of employment. 
   <br>&emsp;In that way, pre-ancient marks a time where there was no excess to inspire or warrant management. “For a tiger is not employed to the hunt, but rather driven, day to day. While a fisherman has a routine, and a reliable one at that —at least he looks for such a spot.” Ancient times are those whereby we surpass the basic quest from nature, and organize ourself to achieve so concretely. That, and as that solidifies, so do we add more employments. And modernity is when we’ve situated ourselves within natures final task, and no longer exist in her response. For the first metallurgist was a result of the first farmer. And indeed, the cares of the farmer, or trouble which his employment solved, gave those to-be craftsmen the openness to discover and see such opportunity. 
   <br>&emsp;What we’d better say is that man has come out of his animal ways, into a state of modernizing. Whereby he settled rudimentary layers, added broader ones, and let the latter settled into something solid, and further went by this routine. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, our state is best reflected in the custom of knowledge, and how what was once thought to be true relaxes, and accepts new truths. In whole, the tale of modernity, or that origin of kinship, is best summized by the earliest inquirers into indefinite things, and the abstract authority such things took, and the reign they held. I can’t say the source of the Greeks inquiry; though we can say that they acquired their ability to write from the Middle East. But uniquely, they were of a world which was, on the whole, well written. Their particular use of writing though, came from geography, in that their ‘managerial’ form derived from the land gave novel means to differentiate and explore. By that, as the earliest inquirers saw only that which they could with their eyes, so did those in the classical age use the spoils and method of writing. Only, prior truths held much sway, and inquirer into such matters —entirely at least- were not fostered. As the farmer permits those in the excess of such advent (in terms of hands needed), so did the stable kinship of the Greek states give a freer edge to their inquiry. “Those in the world at that time had no lesser means, rather the liberty to use it. The Greeks were merely fortunate enough to have enough civil freedom to explore (as man had done before) in contemporary ways.” 
   <br>&emsp;And indeed, the uniqueness of the Greeks is perhaps a mark of civil inquiry —using writing and past things written. While the roots of the world had been laid in the inquirers of old —the results of which only grew with time (as they could), and not with genuine reform- the conservative, if not convicted basis which such beliefs produced, gave no way for inquiries born of a newer age. Again, the Greek states gave enough freedom for such inquirers to be made. And while the rest of the world, initially inspired or not, kept down the traditional course, the pure inquiry of the Greeks still lay. And despite the more contemporary view of tradition (in the religions of high antiquity) so did the view born from modernity inspire those who later uncovered such riches. 
   <br>&emsp;At first the Caliphate found the greek texts, spurring an arabic renaissance near the tip of the millennia. Then, via the charm of that, and the connection (via the crusades) of the east and west, so did those Greek inspired goods re-enter the meditteranean. I must admit some ignorance, but as we all known, the mid way of the millennia saw a dispersion of many folk away from tradition, and into different forms of theology. And my ignorance lies in the connection between the greek inspired scholatiscim (as conducted by those of tradition), and those who saw such work as a motive to something other than such tradition —however revitalized by the greek methods.

<div id="manytasks">
   Virtue is a mark made by demands, in that, of the function which is laid out, so lays virtue by ones able hand. But so do such workers likely have more than one need —as remarks the demands. “Where is thy food? Over there perhaps? It would seem so, but guarded by natural fortuity —in distance, skill, Required time, insight.” That wall to what we seek, as shown by the friction between whats sought and satiety, is the speaker of demands; who says, ‘all those who speak right and well, will pass.” 
   <br>&emsp;But man is thus asked to say many things. He collaborates though with others of the species, as some may speak this language, that dialectic, those words. “By which the discourse between nature is had at multiple points.” For not even the smoothest of talkers could survive if their charm was only in the words of food. “For Posiedon must also be greeted, and the God of shelter at that — Hepheastus we’ll say.”
   <br>&emsp;I admit this is not sound entirely, but a fair principle could be, that man, in his sociality, is motivated and successful as so, by the collective virtue instated, and at that the plurality in points of success. “A true complexity of natural discourse.” 
   <br>&emsp;That being said, the conduct of man has never been so successful on the basis that there were others around him who held virtues he did not. This in itself is true, but is not the point where one thrives. Rather, the virtues of such collective, and at that the propriety in such variable employment, marks the true point of success. For in that, all needs are in question; and thus, the collective virtue is deemed remarkably so, if it is effective in such unity. If one part fails, then the whole does not succeed. And by that, so do the members without such means, personally fail. That is the dynamic of virtue in a team.  
   <br>&emsp;Indeed it is one thing to measure the accounts of such virtue; as one with a skill for navigation may simply be unhad. But it is another, that within the presence of a fully collective means, that so is the management of such collective a virtue in itself. 
   <br>&emsp;For the process of community is not so easy to say. As we must look at the early remnants of man, and primates at that, to see why the ability for communion is possible. But in terms of our principle, we could say that as one man achieves success in navigation, and another in the foraging of food, that reciprocally they share: as the spoils of one meets the needs of the other: and together, each of their needs are filled —via sharing. But if we could imagine that such harmony is based on an understanding of the other, in that one sees their ability to do one thing, like the other; and by each particular success, the bounty is shared. But as this shared employment ensues, so is there a remark about the needs of the communion. For the individual functions are acted as extensions from a common point —to which the shares are returned to. “I’ll go west for wood, and you east for stone: meet back here and we’ll share the flame.” But upon that, as each is settled amidst the shared goods, the question of sustaining such employment is wondered. At least, an inquiry as to the merits of proper management of such collective comes up. As one would level out a path to a reliable means of resources, so would a community establish within themselves the grounds and character to improve such collective. For there may be problems we could afford to solve, via the efficiency. That, or we may improve the means to the ends we’ve already employed ourselves towards. Better yet —though this may simply be how it happens, as opposed to being supposed— that our attention may catch onto things we had no prior awareness of. For people tend to get sick; but our collective is aimed primarily at gathering shelter and fuel. But so does the solidity of that afford some attention to remedying our illnesses. “Even past that, lies one who, upon sitting up from some ail treatment (to catch their own breath), saw a star twinkling in the sky. And what may that be?”

<div id="neargoods">
   So I tend to make claims along the lines of virtue, rather than ideals. One sees the world theoretically, and orients it so that, if upon good action, preferred results would shine. While the other, simply adheres to the world as is. Moreso, the conditions which we adhere to are not altogether altered, in action or wish. 
   <br>&emsp;At that, the difference comes down to who we are as people, in that, of the good, it is through us in and how we are. While the goods of ideals, seem altogether arbitrary, albeit with strong intent. 
   <br>&emsp;It is hard to say though, for the goods of ideals are found in the realm of philosophy and civics. Meaning, that the ultimate notion of the soul is used as a principle, and ordained to us; with the gumption that we are set and known within such basis. “To which, our ideal good, is marked by our ideal portion of such basis.” But such an end is not about our heart and bones, rather the motions of our objective being upon the soul. “Which is to say, that transcendent or not, that our natural being is set (or sourced) upon something truer; of which theology and pure morality conjecture about.”
   <br>&emsp;That is one thing though, for the character of metaphysics and all its adjacent is not in any way simple to say. Virtue however, is much easier to expound. 
   <br>&emsp;For starters, the idea of virtue is, in its form, applicable to the real and ideal world. A saw for instance, has an objective form by which it is virtuous, or sharp; but it also has an ideal form, by which its principle purpose is exhibited; and virtue may be of such. Or in other words, the proper trait it exhibits may be with respect to its real or ideal form. 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, I mean to speak of real virtue. Or the property which best responds to the conditions we’ve experienced. “The nature around us, and what she’s shown and asked us to adhere to; rather than what we think, if we adhered to, would produced something ideal.”
   <br>&emsp;For the problem lies in the ends, and the gaze beyond who one simply is. For in that, I notice that a lack of food breeds insatiety, as will a lack of water leave me parched; and too little warmth similarly, or an excess of wetness.
   <br>&emsp;I say all this, for I mean to see the world as something we respond to, rather than surpass, and then oblige some further plea. There may be perils waiting for us, ‘sent by one who cared little that we had otherwise reached success’; whereby our damnation was due to ignorance and content — as if in terms of the world, we’d won. Equally, this sensibility may afford promise, in that, if we went past such ignorance, then we may reach further and or greener pastures.
   <br>&emsp;This is the true line whereby the critiques of the past meddle with the current scope of philosophy, and the increasing satiety and content of modernity. For in that reign, crumbles the principles of such ‘foreign’ fears and promise. For they seem either uncredible -and at that contrary- or are not so abundantly decent in their reward; as man, in his nature, cares little more than for a fed stomach, quenched mouth, warmth of a home and that of a friend, and a marbling of security and creative access. “It is a fair critique of those who suggest otherwise, that their motives are born from a lack of the former mentioned.” For there is indeed, historically, a damning statement by those who profess some greener pasture. “As if the current grove was riddled with rubble and despair.” Indeed this is true, for man’s belly is not always full; nor does any meal promise the next. “But the promise of satiety is what he truly seeks; rather than the possibility of goods which come outside such condition.” 
   <br>&emsp;A great deal of conflict has come by man starving himself down the path to the goods beyond: and those hungry later on, parlayed for the satiety of that. “At least, in fact, man has not beholdened himself entirely to the lands beyond the world, and at that his earthly need."
   <br>&emsp;But so lies the motive for humanity, that her brethren may be with fuel and stead. And as one alone does what they can with the tools they have, and a pair of others does so equally but for the gain of both, so is the collective of all people an extension of such efficacy, and the shared customs (as shown by the worth) for such community, so that it may be as ably run, holds but an association of personal agreements, ‘by the reciprocity that each member sees, in their offer and reward’. Virtue as I say, in this practice, is merely the demonstration of such intent by the people in such association. 
   <br>&emsp;This may be itself full of principles and ideal, but the basis is one of man, and at that it's possible mean of responding to nature. Generally, the conduct of the community may itself be extold. But the reality is, that such a community is merely a group of individuals exhibiting collective virtue. 
   <br>&emsp;At that, I mean only to start with words and custom as becomes me and my fellow man. This text is an illustration of that after all; and lives in the world of both my expression (e.g in letters or speech) and subjection (e.g gravity and need to breath).
   <br>&emsp;The past is not unimportant, but simply serves as a datum of experience. The vectors and eligibility of propositions are in full use here, whereby those who offered so a time ago, are measured by the methods used to determine today.
   <br>&emsp;Of an end though, which is seemingly forever conceded to, and at that in our efforts to define. 
   <br>&emsp;In that, the core virtue is one of real knowledge, in that someone is aware of and ordained to the character needed for the truest end. It may be one beyond the bounds of earth, and at that, the extent may be one that offers additional promise, or threat. But so, whoever knows, will be in possession of a proper guide. For with such knowledge, they hold the ends to which they must calibrate themselves towards. “Whereby real virtue is bound.”

<div id="frombelow">
   People are trying to learn about the world. Doing so requires that they investigate. During so, they experience the world as they are able to, ‘in that one’s normal vision only sees a certain spectrum of light’. But as much as their faculties can compute, so will their impressions apply.
   <br>&emsp;In this though, lies the kinds of knowledge one receives, namely those which are natural or supernatural. Of the former, these remark the repeated, or at least seemingly sequential occurrences of the world, and the inscription (by the viewer) of such sequence. The statement of such ebbs and flows amount to laws, in that by whichever basis, so are such motions produced. “And laws describe such motions.” 
   <br>&emsp;If the matter is not natural, but of a supernatural sort, all this means is that what one experiences is not an occurrence of nature’s sequence, but an instance instead. In that, lies the heart of miracles, visions and reactions from a supposed other world. An augur for instance, sees a birds flight and interprets that as meaning something for the natural world. “As if the tectonic plates below caused a motion of the bird, and gave the impression that other objects would be subject to a certain motion within their own relation to the plates.” 
   <br>&emsp;Distinct from that is a messiah, which is not merely an instance or act which corresponds with the baser motions beneath, but is an exhibition of such basis in object form. The bird that an auger sees is not itself an insight, but rather what such motions suggest of the basis below. A messiah on the other hand is akin to such basis taking on the form of a bird, and flying in a elaborate way: by which something clear and deliberate is given in terms of insight, rather than a conjectural supposition of what the flight of an ordinary bird means. 
   <br>&emsp;It is true though that such a prime being is not necessarily natured, for they may be a normal object (with communicative potential) which is intimately linked with the basis; or they be the basis itself, merely formed in a way that allows for communication. 
   <br>&emsp;In either case, the conduct of such being is one of alteration and insight. For they may literally turn water into wine, or share what God has told them. And it is not unreasonable to suspect that someone listening to the words of the latter does so because they’ve seen (or heard of) acts of the former. 
   <br>&emsp;In this though, lies the critical divide between science and divine based philosophy. For both, per the core of philosophy, seek a truth (and by that permit the presence) of something deeper than the surface level appearance of the world. “As if there were more than what we commonly saw.” But in terms of what they are trying to explain, or find the basis for rather (of such appearance), so does such subject come about through natural or supernatural means. For one who sees a miracle, or hears the words of a spirit, will seek the explanation of that. While someone who observes the moon’s motion’s, and ascribes such steps as reminiscent of dynamical laws, will seek the basis of that. As Newton said, ‘by whom and to whichever end I do not know, but of what is governed it is these motions; and such motions are understood by these descriptions.” Saying, in other words, that via such descriptions, we understand the objects which are under (or on) some basis.  Philosophy is the admittance of such basis, and not then a denial of the real world, nor an acceptance of rhythmic laws. To be fair, the things which the laws express, or illustrate, has no definite limit in terms of what can be known; nor is it unfair to suspect that as our understanding (and descriptions) reach greater depths, that the basis for such things will become known. Or, better said, that what we mean when philosophizing, that beneath even the understood surface, lies a basis to that; but so may the basis of that be itself definite, rather than metaphysical.  
   <br>&emsp;Metaphysics, or a transcendant basis, may be possible, or it may simply be real — or not meta, but definite, and not transcdenat, but entire within the reality which there’d be transcendence of. 
   <br>&emsp;In that way perhaps, it might be better to ascribe the confidence in the latter as a faith in reason, in that if we are to be complete in that way, then we will have understood and explained all things within reality —with no transcendent need. 
   <br>&emsp;Bringing this back, it is all too common for ‘supposed’ instances of things not seemingly real, to serve as either indicators or proof of something transcendent. Beyond the source of speech and thinking, the alteration of water into wine is not something which, in a pure reality, is consistent with the rest of things. Thermodynamics for one, does not permit it.

   What we are going to assume, is that man is an animal, and at that something with needs; which is to say a relation with nature, who both supplies and demands (in efficacy); moreso, has she gracefully made us with those tasks in mind, and at that formed us to be in need of the results of such task. This is what we are.
   <br>&emsp;We also must assume that we are social animals, in that of such tasks, we both recognize the worth in cooperation and have the means to do so. In this lies a property of virtue, namely the resourceful aspect of it, in that if one is in need of food, then the virtue required is not only in character but ingenuity, in that the route to such ends can be seen, but executed on to. For example, if one’s ingenuity can see that a shell is liable to be smashed (and offer the food inside), then the trait which provides such recognition is in need of a paired trait of dextrousness, and at that craftiness, in order to conjure and harness the thing which smashes. All in all, our recognition of cooperation is one which requires the ability to see others as viable benefit, and then act in ways that facilitate such unity. “Mans basic social virtue is in seeing others as allies, and treating them with as is appropriate for reciprocity.” And beyond the smaller locale, a broadening of such union may neccessitate collective virtues, as to permit organization of the many, and at that the concession of each to the whole. “This extent of man’s basic social virtue is perhaps one of reproach and sense, in that two hands being better than one may be so in the furthest sense, but thus require the facilitation of such community. To which man’s baser virtue is paired with a sense of reason, as to consent to the will of such virtue.” 
   <br>&emsp;At that, it is fair to say that man must be reasonable so much as he is virtuous, for what the latter suggests (in proportion to its scope) bears weight upon the formers presence, as to guide what may otherwise be contrary to the promise of such virtue. “Wait my friend and see, and your conceit to such community will bear fruits greater than your own impulses and effort.”
</div>
<div id="swordandhand">
   As it were, this sense of collective virtue is not itself a marker for an age. Man may be social and collective, but in a merely minor, if not local degree.
   <br>&emsp;What separates primitive man from those ancient is in the unity of such locales; so that a tribe has to deal with other tribes, and at that convene. Surely the transition from primitive to ancient ways saw times where such ‘convening’ was unfruitful. But eventually communities bigger than tribes ensued, becoming states, and empires of those. 
   <br>&emsp;It might be fair to think in terms of civility, and by that recognize villages as the earliest civil communes. Their comparison to a tribe is not clear, but the presence of infastrastucre is surely a dsitnguihshing factor. 
   <br>&emsp;What we mean then, is that villages, or civil communes, interact with those of the same sort, and at that, broaden the collective into something akin to a state, or kingdom. These, to be clear, are what empires are composed of, in that the realms of Africa, Spain, Italy, France and Central Europe constituted the empire of Rome. While each province was a mesh of smaller (village like) constituents.
   <br>&emsp;At this point, I am not clear on the ideals of a collective beyond that of a village. And historically, it seems that such attempts were more on the selfish end. And I must admit that the peculiar facts of that are not known to me.  “Perhaps I wish not to grieve over such ‘conquests’, and at that graze over this state of empires and states.” 
   <br>&emsp;Beyond the impetus, it is somewhat fair to presume that such union of smaller collectives was done through conflict. Indeed, I can see the value in the world as it is; at least it seems unlikely that a plethora of villages would each build their own factories and transmit systems. Thus there seems merit in higher collectives by virtue of the greater amount of resources that the administrators can expel. I also think that the impetus for ancient collectives was mystical, in that those of higher rank in the smaller communes were seen as exhibitors (and at that earthen judges) of the Gods; and that by the convicted quest to have all foreigners (alike the natives) submit to such King, so the impetus lay.
</div>
<div id="manssprout">
   As it were, lands that united themselves into kingdoms and empires, grew more reach then those which remained ‘pastural and village like’. This can explain the ability for Europe to colonize the Americas, despite there being people present. If such folks had extended the scope of their community, then so their stamp be in place. But a countries power far supersedes those of individual clans. 
   <br>&emsp;In an equal manner, the legacy of knowledge pours from those who acquired the most of it. And those who could, did so according to their means, in both skill and liberty. For the freest thinkers of primitive times had nothing but their wandering gaze —and broad definitions. While those with precise language and the method of writing could ask and ponder in more elaborate ways. “For more had already been via written hands.” But so do such means require the freedom to use them. And past the advent of culture -and its mystical side- so were blanked questions discouraged —fatally in some instances. 
   <br>&emsp;Along these lines, the Greeks were part of a time which had come from the prior age of Mesopotamia -and her findings. From this, beyond any derived context, they strictly found the means for writing. Paired with that was the structure of their states, which were quite stable due to their limits via geography. From that, nestled a relatively high amount of freedom to pursue both inquiry and craft. Per the former, the Pre-Socratics, Sophists and Hellenes lay. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the lands around Greece progressed as all others had civilly, namely in the lining of states into empires. In the case of Greece, the Northern realm of Macedon incorporated those in the southern peninsula. And those by the Romans forthwith. 
   <br>&emsp;I cannot speak to the civil state of the Arabs, but via the uncovered Greek texts they were inspired to in the ways they inquired, or that they should inquire at all. Regardless, a middle eastern age of inquiry ensued. And to those later associated with them did the spoils (of prior Greek thought) continue. 
   <br>&emsp;The point, is that the world operates a certain way. And generally, most of it behaves in the same manner. Only, the reason for any present motive is likely born from some past initiative —i.e. the primitive notion of a leaders divine right, and at that endowment to all property and folk (be it foreign or native). But, the natural expression of people outside antiquate ways, makes for developments which stick around, ‘even when such folk are smothered by the surrounding states and their tradition’. 
   <br>&emsp;Indeed, this is the mark of the Greeks, in that they were simply those of higher ancients who purely thought. 
   <br>&emsp;But the question is of our civility, and the manner in which it broadens, and for which ideal end. For I want to say that the current state of the world is simply one born of all the pieces settling together, and at that by an age which was prompted up (initially) by such decree to expand, and at that vie for lands and right. “All those native, born and led by such decree, saw all things beyond them as property of theirs. At least to be.” Indeed, as remarked by those broadly conquesting, that those who lived in their sought for lands were but barbarians, and sometimes savages. For the latter marks a sort of perceived conduct of a people; while the former term is but a disintciton between those native and not. “They are barbaric who are not of us.” Which is indeed a relative term, and at that possible within any character —as all can see who they are, and who is not.
</div>
<div id="fruitsofsettlement">
   The notion of locality, and at that nativity, within early tribes, is to me an anthropological mark of people. Just as we assume, or at least mention our ability to socialize, so ought we include the notion of fear, and of what. Whatever then spurs conflict is one thing, or for what ends rather, but that there were ‘others’ is not surupisring.  “Collective virtue has never been a matter of people, but our own folk.”
   <br>&emsp;The reality though is that collectives are governed beyond their basic ends. And by that it is important to note how certain issues become addressed through the collective. In that lies the mystical findings of man, and the incorporation of such truths into the functions which the tribe provides. 
   <br>&emsp;For it has been said that community allows for efficiency, and at that spexiliaztion; either in the ways that current things or done, or for new things which get noticed in this state of excess. By my accounts this is where spirits and folklore were born. The details regarding it, as in the case of the motive and effects of food and conquest, are not known. But it seems fair (as in those others) to fit in generally. 
   <br>&emsp;If I knew more, I might be able to mingle conquest and piety together. It seems that the heart of the latter came about prior to any extensive acts of the former. I cannot say entirely though that said latter caused such former acts. Those seem to be based on a discrimination of whats native and foreign. The motivation could be to destroy such things beyond the locale, or to assimilate them. At least their views may be self involved, in that they thought they had rights to all —partocualry of those in leadership roles. Divinity surely had an influence then. 
   <br>&emsp;Overall, it is not hard to see that as the bounds of earth were settled, and for whichever reason conflated —first into villages, then kingdoms, empires. And such states brought with them that tradition of piety. Which by my accounts is the source of all things bigotry. For it is one thing for ‘all things foreign, or not native’, to be deemed a threat; as not even deer are accepting of much more than their local herd. It is another though, for the motions of such discrimination to have antagnositc motives curried by religion. Thats not to say there isn’t conflict born from natural ends. But of the direction born by religion, I’d say the source of elitism and genocide spring from there.
   <br>&emsp;Again, the discirmante conduct of man is more or less natural. Only, the twisting of such impressions can make the destructive interests moreso, or at least create a classist attitude regarding those assimilated. 
   <br>&emsp;Better said, the separation between folk is one thing; but religion, and or piety born of a certain locale, only makes those within that locale more unique, and at that inherently different than those around. And whether such difference spurs elitism or genocide, so is the native sense one of further distinction (regarding all thats foreign).

<div id="partinwhole">
   Ideally, we’d know how things come together, and thus have some guide for the time ahead the present. 
   <br>&emsp;But this seems unnecessary, and at that not to be so. For we have said, generally, that considering our need to breath, eat and sleep, that so hath nature given us the means to such ends; but in that, required of us to be a certain way, principally (as in disciplined) and with skill.
   <br>&emsp;The question, is if a group of individuals exhibits collective virtue, what does that mean for the individual themselves? Perhaps the modern source of this conundrum, whereby the form of such collective is off, brings up questions of bravery and protest.
   <br>&emsp;But in that, I see but a moment ahead, and at that one’s vitriol in the imbalance of that moment to be. In terms of the future, so does momentum and trajectory lay. And by that, the vitriol of the moment is exchange for calmer virtues; one’s which exhibit themselves with respect to the whole of our days, rather than the evident moment. 
   <br>&emsp;Its important to note, that by the annals of consistency of anisotropy, that the form of things at hand bears more assumptions than the natural need (and our according natural presence) to eat and sleep, but also sense, worry, fear, and by that see beyond what is definite and clear, in those things of an abstract or mysterious sort. As man’s expression had the time and developed means to paint bulls on the wall, so was he able to express his notice of the sky, the moon, devastation, and common disturbances such as illness or death.
   <br>&emsp;It is important, and at that interesting, to explore the basis of these assumptions —in our needs and impressionability. But I’d say, for the moment, that we can merely express that collective virtue is one, that in all senses of frailty, ought one fix such, or address it at least.
   <br>&emsp;For one permits themselves being equitable within the collective, and by that, subject to the custom of such collective -be it in the vibes of each member, or those which are determined, and at that managed. 
   <br>&emsp;Besides any recent examples, it is our point to note that one’s place in the collective is not entirely made by their reasonable exceptence of its ways, but in that a more civil reward from their participation; and at that, a liberty to do as they leisurely, craftily and or curiously please. Mistaken truths cause friction here; but our ideal remains. 
   <br>&emsp;This is where I struggle. For the American dream is that each member has the rights and freedom to pursue what they please. And by that, each family which comes, be it with nothing or a historic all, can act liberally, and at that via their own interest. What is proper though, is that such interest be in line with the ways of the collective. Despite holding the right to suffrage and thought, so mustn’t they committ theft or assault, and at that coerce someone to doing something out of custom. 
   <br>&emsp;My ignorance though prevents me from stating the ‘inhumane’ policies instigated or disgenuine activity. Are corporations a vice to the collective, and at that preachers and belligerents. Saying who these are, and in by which whole educate, is not easy to say. Though much public information is. Expressed around such disputants. 
   <br>&emsp;I can only say, that if someone is wrong, or inappropriately behaved —for none, outside the military, have any permission to commit violent acts- that their place in being so within the complex of the industrial age is one that wholly derived from baser principles. And necessarily, the various parts of that complex ought be considered when we judge those involved in such level. For in the collective virtue, their may arrive the presence (and by that submission) to a charter, whereby certain rules and custom are agree’d upon for the functioning (and at that benefit) of the collective. In that though, there may be additional posts, such as the facilitators of such laws, and the judgement of those in contrast. Here lies the birth of courts, and at that administrators of the collective policy. By this decree, the need of which is born from the agree’d upon structure of the collective, so is the employment of such role in need of one’s compribale in such task. Thus came legislators, litigants and judges. 
   <br>&emsp;My point, is that if we are to judge a litigant and the the quality of their litigating conduct, ought we know the form and virtue inbided which such person is evaluate against.  “What is a good lawyer, and a proper one at that? And ought we have our own sense of why there is propiety at all, and at that contextual aims (for which virtues are valued traits).”
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, this is just a method of propiety, in that we hold our criticisms and contrition at bay, less we have a solid basis to judge on. What the real question is, or the main one, is the duty of those in the collective to partake in such roles of litigation or legislative creation —and so forth to military operations, civil engineering and so forth. For it is one thing to say that a litigant is bad; while it is another to say that, all things considered, that my place as a non litigant is not to do with the business of litigation. At that point, it is perhaps right that such realms of the collective ought have their own committees and checks, as to suitably manage such affairs. For my place as a shoemaker does not imbibe me with the proper sense of a litigants abilities or conduct. But this evaluation need not be self managed, or at least internally managed (by other litigants), but by a focused group of those educated in the proper ways of such litigants; and like a enforce and or official of the law, who holds reign over those breaking it, so do such monitoring committees serve as a suitable enforce over the field of litigants.

<div id="drivingforce">
   My thoughts always come back to virtue, in that we are all subject to something, and at that, virtuous by our effective oblige. What this is in contrast to is hard to say; but perhaps a fair note is that the things were subject to, truly, are not able to be changed, merely responded to.  The difference is seemingly one of history, and how people see the obligations placed upon us as done so though the wills of other people; and at that seem liable for change.
   <br>&emsp;This is not base enough, by my counts. For indeed, laws, states, economies and office have come about; and beyond their own arrangement, so has primitive thought influenced the succeeding generations involvements (in such arrangement). But the source of this all is upon those base necessities; which even upon the fairest of states, still rests upon the unyielding demands of nature, and at that our virtuous oblige.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, false pretence has born a lineage of native divinity, and at that a contrast was those of other nativities. This has been incorporated into the sense and structure of modern states; at least the former quality was part of the classical irons, while the latter was ingrained to those medieval. Even though industrial states have rid the premises of such tradition, so do the liberated folks have no lineage of their own. Despite the lands being at liberty for them, so are they incapable, by their previously held position. “Thus the critique’s of modernity lay; not in their motive and course, but the history of those partaking in the lanes: and some being steady footed compared to others.”
   <br>&emsp;This is an odd sentiment. For the specifics really don’t matter. Instead, the notion of virtue is binary in its address, in that we either head for the ideal, and let the validity of that even things out; or we locally, or via the moment address, and at that resolve ourselves to the status of the collective, rather than its end. 
   <br>&emsp;For the inequality of folk is more or less born from classist mindsets. That, and the idea of locality, and the ceasing domain beyond such borders -by which those outside are not of right. Conquest arrives here, as does slavery.
   <br>&emsp;But let’s consider for a moment a native family, who is not subject (or has been) to retched inequities, but simply held lineage in the heart of a powerful land. If they are workers in an economy, then what ought they receive in terms of sympathy?
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps its better to remark the reasons which distributed custom and roles within the baser societies, and at that, made way for states which proliferated the inequity we see today. 
   <br>&emsp;For my belief is that, beyond something true, that the inequity towards those of contrary sexes, orientations, faiths or ethnicity, is purely born from a compounded culture of ignorance, mistaken pretence, and by all that, an evident lack of inquiry —for none without the clasp of common consent, thinks purely and sees people as anything but equal. 
   <br>&emsp;And thankfully, the validity of the ancient ways gave way to the want of something more reputable and modern; by which pure attempts were made (with modern means) to assess the world and what it means. Whereby, the notion of religion remains, but beyond ancient views; along with liberty becoming present; and developing truly by the friction of precedence, and at that the world’s status as would permit (admittedly young liberal) views that bore complete equity. 
   <br>&emsp;We have reached this purity though. At least, we as in those common and or reminiscent of the West. Here, and by all alike, the affairs and being of sexes, orients, faiths and ethnic identities hold worthwhile truth; and by that, are accounted for equally within the basis by which collective virtue lay. “For there are none who we’d call man, who do not measure to the status of members, and at that contributors to citizenry and rule.”
   <br>&emsp;It is only our nearly modern case, whereby the finishings of this war (of new and ancient) is but a battlefield of wounded and deprived. For indeed the battle for humanity is won. At least our demise is all together. And beyond the cares for our lasting time as one’s whole and of unity, so is such union full of stragglers, and at that those bolted behind. For some can not even partake in the liberties now given. “For many paths require one to be so tall, liquid, able.” And the result of those liberties being unpresent prior, means that some people have nothing -and thus have no means to begin. 
   <br>&emsp;I am not sure if this is just part of the collective, that it would account for and service what it can those who were let down by its prior inefficiency. Veterans seem to be treated this way. At that point though, besides the efficiency of our fortunes and excess, what is the course for those with nothing? What resources and or opportunities are available for people in that state? “In this newly open world, where is the potential for those whose first step is to begin?”
</div>
<div id="odddevelopment">
   What is the purpose of all our efforts? Is it not the liberty of all, to see and do as they please? 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps, it is truly bring our nature in line with that the world, for harmony. There the gift of virtue lies, in liberty namely, and at that peace.
   <br>&emsp;But the ebbs of our nature is such that the attempt to harmonize brings fear; as our motivations based on mystery bear upon us further confusion, and at that reserve. By some mechanic the truth comes out, and our hesitance seeps. 
   <br>&emsp;I just wonder if we always knew that there were no Gods, and that the mechanics which bore us need for breathe also bore the air and currents, that the efficacy in meeting such needs would be a complete and utter success. For I believe the tales tell us that meeting the demands of our animal needs bore insight to further problems: namely death and the pleasing of God. But so much of the reoncilliation with that has created depravity, ‘as everyone push each other aside in order to reach the top’.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the aim is always reconciliation, but of our nature with the world. In that lies an evident prosperity.
   <br>&emsp;The oddity of man is in his attempts to solve ‘ancient problems’ -as compared to those primitive and innate, that much of the struggle to modernity arrived.
   <br>&emsp;In a broad sense, the peril of the stone age was in those unable to harmonize with nature -whereby they’d starve and whither.  While the modern peril is one where people fight each other, ‘like two babies yanking at the same toy’. The motive is the same, but the ancient sentiments bring false pretence to ‘others’, and their right to be, or at least be equal.
   <br>&emsp;I do admit some ignorance in the function, or at least mechanism by which fear is produced. But I submit the notion of a nightmare, and how impressionability, unfamiliarity, and an otherwise lack of similar (if not associated) definition, can lead to such conception. “If only in a dream.” But so, in life, can we be misled, or mistaken at least, and by that deem something to be problematic; or at least feel a problem is present. “For it is not a far stretch to describe earlier points of man, where he not only say the volcano as a threat, but an instigator of it.”
   <br>&emsp;If were thinking ideally, or at least in terms of virtue, then we can presume the notion of communal harmony, or group relations, and how the mistaken actions were done in such relations, or at least internally following combination.
   <br>&emsp;In that way, it is hard not to say that if your part of a community, and some of its members are suffering from previous struggle, that your part of the collective is in helping them. At least, as you act with the collective in mind in positivity, so ought you act with it in mind if there are parts of it which have succumb to negativity. “Normally, we win, and share the spoils; and collective virtue is submitting yourself as to be equal to others. But if we loose, then we at best hold eacother up in our loss, and persevere through the trouble. And if some of us are fine, then perhaps our role is to help those who are not."

<div id="propietouspath">
   Our liberty is a weird thing, for we never truly have it. Even if we thought, ‘well, how lucky are we, to have this job, these means, and the life that goes with it’, so would other hurdles come our way; for our finances don’t impact our vulnerability to sickness, injury, loss, nor death. And at that, the actual quality of our lives, in terms of the means of it all being agreeable and light, and the good in it being accessible, broadening and scrumptious, does not come via cash. 
   <br>&emsp;What I ultimately seek is stability. For my contributions are one thing, and indeed the core of our life is screaming for such purpose. But this really comes because of an inability to be ourselves; which I can only say comes about due to the choices we’ve made.
   <br>&emsp;For whichever reason, we’ve become generous and wise. And in doing so, we’ve invited indifference or critique; and at that, error in our way leave us vulnerable to such friction. But the primary course we’ve taken is one that has oriented itself based on those experiences; whereby what was good  was that which came from our propriety, while the bad was either in the erros of such ways or the conflict which such state of ours brought. Just as we are averse to television and chicken, so are we withdrawn from the conduct of others. Who I care not if they are not great; nor do I mind their indifference. But when my actions become an imposition towards them, or they simply refute and or deny the choice I’ve made and their worth, then I feel like our environment is hostile. “Like a gay man walking around, acting straight, but feeling resentful that their expression is necessarily dull —by fear at least.”
   <br>&emsp;But via this course, despite its wonder and glee, so have we departed from the common rungs of life. We have no real relationships, nor are we involve with anything beside our interests; that, and we have no profession or civil means. And beyond the wish to validate myself, and at that settle into the ‘indifference’ which I experience from others —as to remove such negativity, and take part with them (from our confidence)— 
   <br>&emsp;What I have is a path which knows its place, and holds little regret or pretence as to the confines ahead. I see however, that our choice is in front of us; and indeed, as one dreams of a profession, or a home, or travel, so do I see an end of stability; for in that, we can rest, knowing that such peace we’ll have. And, like all paths, it becomes easier in the present knowing that your on one; for current choices have a propriety which is not purely based, but built into some course forward. “Giving a permit to liberty and rest, for we see where else were obliged.”
   <br>&emsp;As it were, reaching that peaceful part of the path is simple as being where I can be myself. And indeed, this is not a point of absence, merely appropriation. For my parent’s are no longer suitable roommates; as their lack of overlap with any basic property is one that makes the kind of actions we take around them, dry. So I mean not to live at home. And I will admit that when I think of where too then, that the idea of a place with many other things is exciting. 
   <br>&emsp;But it really is a scenario of stability which I seek. The garments of opportunity and fun are nice, but appeal little to me in our greatest gait. I really just want a place that is hospitable, and at that lush. For any place will do; and living with your mom and dad will always permit the least room, ‘for their nature per the family is one of unbridled intimacy; as they treat you not like a person, but a son, a family member; yet they also act with free admittance, as if nothing is expected of them’. And indeed this is often fine, for I don’t mind being agreeable and pertinent. But so in our imperfect ways, and even the expression of the propriety into our thriving state, is one that hardly finds productive reception; or plain acceptance.
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, I mean not to live with our family. It is just to hard to be myself. And the benefits of doing so are not sufficent anymore considering they afford. Nothing which we could otherwise do is worth being averse towards. And seeing as the gain of being at home (and free) was that so we could concentrate on me, so is the constancy of that wishing for a place to actually be, ‘for the development is cemented’. That, and the freedom which afforded this is no longer a surplus over the required efforts to support ourself. Those efforts are in some ways rewarding, and beneficial at that; but so is their demand not so drearing anymore, considering our strength form such constancy. And I felt this before, but whatever toil there was, held worth by the nature of the being which such efforts supported.
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, I will keep to our path of personal propriety; for even beyond the nurturing of it, so are the goods around it able to sunk into. Preference then, in terms of locale and flow of itinerary, is part of this process, in that of our every day, so ought the goods and duty around mesh with our propitious efforts and craft. “I seek a place that would, in full, house and or enrich our common pace of being.” 
   <br>&emsp;Further, the breadth of our expression is in par with the desires one seeks. In that, of the good there may be abundance,but so in our time there may be romance, friendship, expertise and broader virtue. These things are inky though, as their promise may be a draw to your idle passions. But so, prior to the extent of such ambition -in business, power, fame, credulity- lies those former elements, of which your ordinary place in society can procure. For desire, with a the smell of that which otherwise draws our passion, so do these occupations rise. And indeed, I may not feel or care for such passions and occupations. But increasingly at least, beyond the zeal of our propriety, is a sort of excess in character that allows for communal participation; whereby the moderate act of making friends, attending meet ups or group chats, even putting yourself out there for romance, become fair and tenuale.

<div id="hometrouble">
   I find myself souly frustrated with my parents because of their lack of interest in what I want. They'd jump in front of a car to save me, and are quite generous at that, but they rarely ask me waht things I want, or what I am apprehnesive about.
   <br>&emsp;Much of my later adolescnece has come about through me trying to clarify such notions. Which, to be clear, was never about affirming it to my parents, but rather solidifying it to myself. It is true that I have spoken with them from time to time, and over the years, our general interests have reached a point that they understand. But for the most part, our lack of rich cooperativness with them, or core understanding, only made me eager to cement whatever such things were. If we had been asked more about such things, then we might have been fine to sit with the common understanding. Seeing as there wasn't any, I sought to explore and define what things were. 
   <br>&emsp;The point being, that I did so out of fear, but also anger, in that the basis for suggestions I'd receive felt off --deep inside at least. And so I sought to clarify, as not to smittenly revoke, but rather clarify the strong grounds my inclings were felt to be.
   <br>&emsp;Where I stand now is on a world stage, completey fine in our views of myself, family and community. But so the rest of humanity lay. And indeed, our parents lack of regard for me when it comes to my interest or care for such things, curries me into defining that for myself. As the central theme of this, as that so long as your part of a family, so will older memebrs have influence over you; and as much as you don't appear in harmony, so will you feel apprhensive. And as it happens, our escepade into personal defintiion, only led me to live freely in such a way. But given our choices, so are we at home with our parents; and from that, there broader views are crossing mine. And because they feel so off from those of mine which spring from our own deep propiety, I have then worked to define such broader views: if only to rest and or converse in a truly sincere way.
   <br>&emsp;On one hand you have the everlasting struggle to agree, and the fair course of inquiry is not one that many exhibit. If I wish to live peacefully though, or at least with decency amidst our proper place within the world, then so ought I know what that means. In that lies our fidelity to the enormity of the world, and our reproach to the all extensive contents in it. Remarking on such material is where I hold my tongue, and at best think, or learn; while the address and adherence to the broader structural fact, is where my propiety lies. Indeed, if I had a moral truth, then the specifics of such structure could be sought, or driven towards at least. But so much as I am in this formative state, so do I at least rest on the fact that of such enormity (in strucutre), the world is.
   <br>&emsp;This is all in part due to our struggle in being alone. For by whicever roots, we have prioritized knowing ourself, and at that the world which we are angled against; and of such demonstration of who we are. Which, to be clear, has never been fought over. But in our formative ways, whereby we are in a state of further finding who we are, that is where disharmony is found. For most people I deal with, have no sense of further finding themselves. And as such, it is as if their waiting for me to finally reach who I am, and thus be. "For action is all they care about." 
   <br>&emsp;Ultimately, I am stuck between the solitude of my choices, and the novel ways of expressing my propiety. Such ways have only come in retrospect, and our common moments are ones of self interest and practice. In this state though, the future is perhaps all to clear yet far, and as we wait to go where we are fair to be, we see the everpresent process of being ourself as one of disharmony. For in such state, we are not entirely sure who we are; and indeed, this constant questioning is from our choices, in that whoever we are, we cannot entirely express that at home. "And deeper down the inquiry lays." 
</div>
<div id="whatguidesme">
   Understanding is a strange thing, as I only seek it when we are without forward motion. Naturally, our being goes, at least with nature's flow. But when were stiff, or stuffy from the ebbs of our current day, so do I seek some sort of bond with the world. 
   <br>&emsp;What I find, is that without some sort of grip on things, I whither, or hanker for such a grasp, and at that feel restless: as if I am seeking, or tightly holding on. While I am, in being that is, so is the world there, for my action is amdist something, like friction or air drafts that lift a kite. Generally speaking I feel this while I am truly alive, and such an expereince exhibits to me the proper course to be. "As if I were a bird who had never flew, but then caught a gust of wind and took full flight: by which I knew who I was, what I was right to be doing, and at that, what nature was in my righthouess in terms of me: and, per the basis of nature whiich produced my own specific sort, so did the heart of nature lay. As if a layer soul rooted in by a tree, and the trunk which held our particular branch."
   <br>&emsp;But understanding, is something which strikes me in our less than soaring state. For in such case, my senses are at one with the medium, and by that, my urge to know is absent, for I already am --and seek thus not. But then even, when I hit a riley gust, and am carried without needing to flap, or simply find a perch to rest, I reflect, settle, and at that, see the milder portions of life amidst me,  having been already amongst the broader currents which broad my fullest self to be. 
   <br>&emsp;This is like life in a way, that without the deeper prescence of living, so can little build off of that, and sprout. "There can be no moss without a tree." 
   <br>&emsp;And what I've noticed incessantly over the years, is that life is not something which is best defined by some core statement of nature or me, but a sort of character which permitts itself to be as it is whole-hearteldy; whereby the primary modes of its being reach full stride, thereby giving a sort of life to the body as a whole. By that, it is able to exist, 'as if therre were some neccessary amount of momentum, for it would otherwise stop and cease'. 
   <br>&emsp;Through that, though I can not entirely say, lies what can only be described as more novel and or muted motions within nature, and at that an association with the sides of nature which pair with such milder ways. This is akin to a bull, in that it moves in a way that reflects its horns, and the modes of defense and or fighting; or a lion and its nature to hunt, or Man and his nature to craft and inquire. But ought death be part of this, or sleep, rest, satiety? These are like a sword in its sheathe, in that totally, the sword is the same, yet considered to be via its core function to swing and strike; whereupon its exhibition of its proper self, bears it a sort of existence which is constant, if not propelled and or in motion by being itself: and all beings need rest. At least, if there was nothing which drew the need of a sword to strike, then it would likely be left on the shelf, for it had no need to be; but in use, it has its sheathe, where it exists complimentary to its primary purpose.
   <br>&emsp;I cannot say though. For I believe that our fears guide our tradition, and by that, less we commensurate antiquated ways, then we are left without an understanding of our own. This is so, for life is not always demanding, in a way which we cannot help but address. 
   <br>&emsp;Our choices have come from fortune, in that our own propiety could be focused on. We needed no room to do this, but saw value where fortune permitted.
   <br>&emsp;Again and again it comes back to our own thinking. In that, without the truth of the world, or some inquriy into that, we are left with the irksome despair of not being ourself. For without such motion, we are subject to others misfortune, raw mentality, cheap contentment, and rude monerging and discipline. By our counts, we saw and harmonized ourself with the hues of nature which seemed both bright and resounding, 'and cared little for what seemed but reflections'. In this though lies the harshest way; for there is both too little which we can afford to ignore or benefit from. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps then I will say. Whatever life is, there is nothing which explains it that a miracle or moral reasoning serves. As we understand the prescence of disease and orbits around the sun, so does our search for deeper truth hold promise. But from what I can tell, the investigation into this is still present, and at that any artfull expression or iqnuriy about it. In fact it is all too contemporary for the former aspect to be overlooked. "And for those in search to be unaware of their beleif that the final anwser is right around the corner." 
   <br>&emsp;We are so confident though, as if the topics of interest we hold so dear, are seen by me without tradition in mind. I take for granted that we will die, and by that seek some sort of grasp on the matter. But in all truth, where my heart lies is in the preciousness of our experience, the felicity of it, and the grand serenity whhich tailors the entire way. This is indeed hard to describe, 'as a deep and shallow breath are not something so clear or common to compare'. Yet, the birth of wisdom sits in the cradle of persoonal knowledge, and the propitous sense that durnkedness, poor punctuality and senseless shame and sedition all lead to uneven and course life. While honesty, virtue and the dearest care exhibit the purest of strenghts and sobriety; the latter being the spring for one's relation with the world. "I just can't illustrate the way that I breathe deeply when the birds are singing, compared to one's obvious pleasure in mac n cheese."

   The core of me may be someone who is lazy, concieted and ashamed.
   <br>&emsp;The root of this may be born of something which does not damn me in being such a way; but still the effect lies.
   <br>&emsp;The struggle in being yourself is an odd thing. For we are all more or less raised, and at that asked to be something; and as much as we aren't we are ushered, and of the route we take, the affront to others expectation returns us with shame. 
   <br>&emsp;And indeed, there is a sort of comfort we experienced throughout our youth, of which we held no other care for in terms of broader/future concerns. When such points were brought infront of us, the importance of them had me feeling a little small and unsure --considering our lack of grip on them. 
   <br>&emsp;But with content I flew, drifting through the days, 'letting the future's prompts arrive'. 
   <br>&emsp;For whichever reason, our choices along the way made me less able and interested towards such prompts. And our mild grasp on them drew discontent from others. 
   <br>&emsp;I can only describe our personal propiety as being born from such dissaray; as we ultimately steared away from the heart of such conflict, or rather the position which others were fighting with me about. Their acceptence was not whole, but so did our lack of commensuration draw their swords not. 
   <br>&emsp;Where do I begin then, along this path of being me. There is much in the way of self doubt and gratuity, but so our finer sense parlays. In that, we are rewarded for our actions and the pastural continuiation of them. We are also reminded by our debts and dings, and the redeeming commission to learn.
   <br>&emsp;People's words sting, especially when we are in a state of doubt and flux. The very fact that we are uncemented, at our age, is something which emitts an ambience of disent from others. And the care of mine is to understand the progress of becoming ourself, but through constant ebbs of failing and learning, and by that refining what it means to be me, that so are there moments were, upon those slips, and on route to a new ideal, we are not. 
   <br>&emsp;In those moments our stair is perhaps a bit too glaring, as if the norms of our high self are held by a tight brace, rather than pure assembly. And generally, our oddities come to light then, as we are awkward in our austerity, and at that all to nimble in avoiding conflict. "Which, in our stiff and changing state, is all more apparent: as interactions with immaleable things is more senstive then those which easily move." It is one thing to share that you are trying this or reaching for that; and another to say that you are trying such things at all, or being in such a way that of such things, your distance from them appropraites an unfinished state. Generally I speak of this as a attitude which makes for change, and committs. 
   <br>&emsp;Theres just this apprhension by your being yourself. And being around others who you feel subject to share such things, but feel averse, makes me feel like hiding. Those who are unassuming, as in most strangers, and not your family, makes such a state unimposed. But the issue really, is not so much that you need privacy, but an admittence of who you are. For being is hard when you are not allowing your strides. And it is not too uncommon to find yourself hindered by past miscommunication.
   <br>&emsp;The heart of the matter lies in the fact that everything about me is weird. I don't use social, I don't listen to lyrical music, I don't watch the news, dramas, sports or twitch; nor do I vote, read much of fiction, comment on the videos I do watch; and at that, I hold no dualistic conception of mind or death, nor do I believe in any graphical represnetaion of culture or violence; I play games, and old ones at that, read books, and very old ones at that; I write, decently, and of myself and natural things; I sit on the floor while doing this, along with games, watching film, fiddling with my computer, and then I sleep there too; I've never had coffee or soda in any meaningfull way, nor have I had a soar throat since my reign or propiety started. I have no job, and own little regard for getting one beyond the simple wages and active kind of work; I am content with a room, walking reguarly, seeing the sun, sky and moon, hearing the birds, the wind, the rustle of trees; nor do I have any deep and or detailed reservations about children, equities or relations being commiserate with such ways. Theres simply too much difference locally and afar, for me to think that others could not agree with me and commiserate; and by my shifting hand too. In all entirety, I want and am unaverse to things uncommon, awkward, lacking custom or tradition.
   <br>&emsp;A man though, is one, in a mature sense, who holds himself to the ways in which he naturally moves and truly is. And in this commisery, the prominet note which he sings is one of understanding; where he sees, by the otherwise fear of being expliclty different, that others also are. And by that, he realizes, that the source of his quirkiness and reproach is not in the material of his ways, but his secrecy and hiding. "It is seldom the man we know who seems perverse and or dangerous, but those who are mysterious." 
   <br>&emsp;As Plato says and all wise men who've followed, 'know thyself', for the world seems clear and even, commesnurable to your case, and at that, ignorant of who you really are. Like all those with paranio, the source is in the sense that your appear shift and mysterious: but this is so, for you are a blurr to yourself, unsure, undefined, and at that, flat in motion and expression. "By which over concentration and defense accrue beneath your hidden state; or your limber around, tight, anxious, scared to speak or be seen."
   <br>&emsp;I see in this though, that one's natural gait paired with their prompt and or interest in speaking, along with the peace within oneself as to in stillness be happy, merge together to form the vector of being through the world. For one's choices marshal their way, and as a harsh aversion to crack cocaine is laudible, so are midler yet common matters derseving of equal discretion. And doing so in seemingly fair ways, can orient your paces through the world and where you go. But so, it seems, that less you conciliate with your equity, personal or of family, have the luck of chance or invested reward or have the annuities of the times, then so will you have to commesnurate yourself in a worldly way. Doing so requires communication, and be it guilded by interest or neccessity, so ought you flaunter and cooperate. For in need, so lies the latter; and in the goods of friendship and chatter, lie the latter. And for sure, having one without the other beckons the holder to bear the other's load. "If I am unfriendly, then our communcation will lack chemistry and free expression; and if I am uncoopeartive, then we will be seperated, and at that left to make ourselves anew."

<div id="thiskindofway">
   Oh meaning, how you crowd my attempts to write. For I cannot just say what things are, but what they mean.
   <br>&emsp;In that, I see that the nature of us being is one of constant repute, as the land around weighs on our otheewise personal effort; and of those who think such things are importnat, that they condem me for not attending to them especially. 
   <br>&emsp;More or less though, our being is such that in full motion, we are brimming, cheerfull, endeared to all. Lacking concrete pleasures, from sex and sugar; but doth beauty lay. 
   <br>&emsp;Besides the quality of our experience, it is neccessary for us to know the form which such motion takes. For it is not a grabbing sort of action or care, but one of managment and solidity: whereby the inputs of life far and around, speak to us, and brighten our day. "And our efforts are in keeping us intune and light as to recieve such gifts."
   <br>&emsp;I will attest to the conflict and friction which this sort of living procures; as others, by their own fear and shame or not, usher me to be more obligate to the world as opposed to ourself. In their aim, the world is what we seek, and ought we be and orient ourelves to acquire it. While my aim is to to wholesomely be, and let what the world offer itself  in the way that those whose mere eligibility (and construct) bears them to see it. 
   <br>&emsp;In this though, by development surely, lies a risk of contradiction, whereby you are yourself and accordingly tuned, but thereby seek the world, as either a  consolation for the struggles in being yourself, or to validate your otherwise personal aim --and remove any outside contempt. 
   <br>&emsp;Outside this contradiction, lies our personal path. And affirmation, or understadning at least, bears us a sort of steadyness as we go through time. For I mean to make friends, foster relationships, romance even. But I am aware that our self interest does not warrant me such things, either practically or because I am special. What I resort to thnking then, is that, in order to be myself, ought I lay within the mere sociable mean, whereby I am friendly, kind and cooperative, and not prone to fancies or expecations born of my ego and loins. From that, I can simply be, and let the world collaspue naturally. For there is no trouble in being yourself, if the communion of such thing exhibits itself sociably. But in terms of relationships, or meaningfull connection, so does expereience line an easier way, in that you learn how to usher these at all; but so do you let things happen, whereby the merrit of relations, in that their is something to bond people, comes by you being integral enough to warrant a bond between somewhat relatable. There is no merrit in saying that the way you are will not be bondable with others. For the broadest of friends comes from the broadest of relations; and I surley lack no friends, but a friendship. And by that, our commradery with folk as it pertains to our passing by or needed prescence amongst them, barrs me the neccessary sociability and cooperation; but not any need to make actual friends. Besides the activites which such pairings exhibit, I don't have much interest in those sort of things to begin with. I am more set, content and indebted to ourself. What I really care for, or am drawn to is meaningfull relationships, or deeper ones; whereby the point of relation is not from some activity, but based on who we are. To be fair, activites are varied, and thus some may bring us together in a way I'm fine with. But, to be clear, it is more about recreation which draws such interest, rather than festivities and celebration. No matter, when it comes to deeper relations, so does this come from you connecting in a meaningfull way. And no matter who you are, your not going to do this with an abundance of people. For in terms of depth, so will only a certain person pertain. I feel this is natural for all people; and my personal stake, is one of sociability amongst collegues, a more honest and at ease communication with peers --as to solidify and or expand shared interests- and a true and open fact of possibility in relations, no matter our differences. "I care little if none relate to me in terms of our non-interest in dinner. Which meaningfull relationship is sprung from such a thing anyway." And indeed, how we are on our own is one thing as remarks these ordianry things; but the point which draws others together, affords both acceptence of those things, and alterations to make such connection work. But they don't foster or deny the connection.

<div id="oughttobe">
   Were all artists in a way, whether that be in paints, words, bravado. But there lies the prevalence of supposition, and the alternate view from inquiry. For the illustrations of craftsmen and pundants is not in itself right or wrong, but merely an expression from prior experience. I know not what that is from; and indeed credulity lies as a sort of inherent merrit.
   <br>&emsp;Where I lie though, is that whoever says this or that I care not, but of those who listen, so are they the thorns in my side. For my take on one thing, perhaps uncommon, leaves me somewhat hanging for conflict with those who see things ordianrly, or at least otherwise. And at any rate, I feel strange seeing the world so differenlty; and partciuarly, if my roots are better, or at least well staked, then the contrariety of that to someone less founded, yet perhaps in a position of authoirty or influence (relative to me or in general), leaves me fearing conflict, or a hidden sense of pirvate truth; which itself leads to a sort of condensation of purjury, 'like my beliefs were without woarrant, or unlikely to be heard'. Indeed I could speak to the rampat simplicity of all far things, and the illusroy swarm of feelings and conviction to boot. 
   <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, our reflective path can pave the way through such thicket. 
   <br>&emsp;In that, I see, that in whole, or near at least to entirety, lies the current of the world; of which we are right to oblige, and thereby earn the goods from such connection --in what is appropriate. 
   <br>&emsp;I must admiit though, that the details of such view are not well defined. For the motions of those around me are not but what seems common; and so any notion of an ideal is not in itself a guide for action, but ointment to uncertainty.
   <br>&emsp;In a truly inquistive way, we remark what is par for the course of our nature, but of the posture and pace through such lane. The idea that family, death and governance are imperatives needs no dispute; but of such things and our resolve, ought reason and honesty conjure our oblige.
   <br>&emsp;In the end, nothing matters; at least little can be attributed to the nature of particles and fields. No matter, as Hume fairly said, that be it the componetns of the matrix or the strands of a dream, that what we notice is equal to the appartus in which we judge; and by that, we take to mean that no matter the nature of things below, so are our regards (in breadth at least) born of such nature; to which we resign our deepest doubts to our own evident nature within that whole.
   <br>&emsp;In this sense, we have the peculiar concept of reflection, or awareness, in that we not only react to things via our bodie's form, but consider, determine, grow. This can be explained by the lineage of thought, and its birth from baser sensation. But removing the core nature which produces such phenomena, and listening merely to the content, which in all fairness the senses form are made of, so do we have the subjects of memory, desire, habit and fear. And perhaps, via modernity, we have literature -in impressions and expression- which let us more acutely grow.
   <br>&emsp;But so the world lay, and us, in experience and understanding around that. As we rightly take for granted the core basis of things, and at the very least act on the principles of Hume, so can we extend such station with an acceptence of our means to learn and know, and at that find suitable paths and execution. By that, our enviroment, in location and time, will determine what material we respect, and at that formulate ourselves against.
   <br>&emsp;Indeed our fear lies in the ways of the past, and the oblige we have based on a unset inquiry: for without our own application and fortuity, so does such novelty remove me from other's arrangment: which itself invites critique and abasement. But neverhtless, there is but a mere practical matter of appropriation in terms of being yourself, and not being so ill set or kept amidst people and their ways. 
   <br>&emsp;What I can see is that the world is large. And albeit it fast, durations of time hold much quantity. And holding myself to some integrity of depth, I care little for nor am I concivted towards, any person, place or thing whose quality of existence I merely suppose. "Otherwise every bug likely stepped on, would grind away at me, as if the world was melting all in its claim." To be fair though, this mark of propiety is one that affords little unintegrity, 'for our own ignornace falls prey to the shallow crys of other people, whereby we feel alone in our mystery, yet pressed by the pleas of other people; which itself makes more our own fear and worry of those subject to their concerns'. 
   <br>&emsp;If we take this concept and apply it to the fortunes of other people, and the conduct of others as well, then all that is left is our perosonal lives. By that, there is but family, and the extension of friends and relations. Foremost, there is what you already have, in guardians and siblings, and what you are more or less natured to acquire, namely whoever you are a guardian off, and another who is in the same state as you. "A partner if you will." Friends are those you find relevance towards, in that you share something in common; be it goals, interests, ideals. Whereas relationships are born from connection; in that, be it through some activity or task, you don't merely spend time together doing it, only then to return to your core life, but rather they are part of that. In the deepest sense they come with you; while those who may be mere close friends, are but part of it. But my collegue at work who I talk games with, or another who I play diablo every so often, these are but friends who I do something with. As much of a relationship as there is, so may your personal lives be exchanged; but it is a more full on relationship if they come to dinner, meet your family, hold some meaning to you in the way that they understand your truth, or engage with you while your in trouble and despair. 
   <br>&emsp;Everyone else is but a portion of our kindred spirit; in that if help was needed, I would attempt to be. But our allowence to them is merely in kindness, not interest or itinerary. 
   <br>&emsp;Assuming there is no moral obligation for you to become a docotr or fireman, nor donate and or protest for the sake of some stranger in Botswana, then your interests really have full luxury. Indeed, it is a primary fact, that your actions would follow what is layed out in the law. And by that at least, so would your actions be fair if aggressive violence or larseny were not committed. Though it is tricky to estimate the requirment for defence, when the motives by the assailents is traditionally wrong. And beyond that, if your efforts and content is concillitroy to public actions which are deemed good for the public, then your position is good. 
   <br>&emsp;There is a matter of contribution though. And per our history, any idea of right and wrong, or real commisery, came when we are about to be grown up; meaning that we had to nourishment that prime statement in our older years. Ideally, perhaps, we'd be full and grown and in the motions by the time were of a higher age. And from that, maybe we'd contriubte. Of this I cannot entirely say. For there is the matter of children, and the contribution which one's commitment to that can only afford. The right time for a child is definitiely one where that appointment is porperly met; but so may that moment be one where broader contribbutions are applicable. Let's say that youth is the primer for being, and adulthood the expression of such being. I don't see children as a starting project for adulthood, but rather something which your fully realized self takes on. "You learn grammar, write, then teach; and having children upon the completion of youth, feels like your learning to be yourself in order to then raise another: all the while, your actually being has not been." At least, the handling of another, whose nature is formed and aimed comparable to your own, does not seem like something which, in handling, you become yourself; but rather, something which earns a hand which has already become steady.
   <br>&emsp;And in that way, by the worlds need at least, ought one contribute upon materliazing themself, and in that prioritize such contribution prior to having children; or should they have children as their prime fruit of able contribution, then attend to the world in their later years? To be clear, neither needs the other to be completed. That is, I don't see rearing children to be a requisite for broader contribution; nor is attending to the world the requisite to then have children. It is one thing to learn the basics then apply yourself, but it is not strictly so, that of the aim which earns your truest abilitly --upon such application- that this should either A) be something essential, nor B) be something which preceds something else eseential.

<div id="gritofreason">
   All of our stress comes from communication. That, and the humbling need to let go of wants from others. 
   <br>&emsp;The issue, is when there are things owed to you, or bed to you via some understanding. This creates a minimum amount of harmony required.
   <br>&emsp;And our greatest discrpency amongst friends and nearby fokl, is to the values and or conduct of family. There is no respect in me, but a reasonable obligation; whereby I listen to those close, as I would show them ore earnestness in aid. But I don't value what they say anymore than if a stranger had said it; as if anything true was so because someone you knew told it. 
   <br>&emsp;And at any rate, what we see as the course of propogration for family, and what we'd teach those ahead, is not in line with what came before. I'd say, that the general school of life has pruned those of an older sort; and squeezed out a sort of grumbled acceptence by those more recent. But our view of things is helmed by reason: for only so much of what I heard could be adhered to. And at that, as I cared little for more than what I felt, so did the futures expecation wain.
   <br>&emsp;It is an odd thing though, for our personal interests don't mean lethargy and at that privation. But in tending to priotize such things, there is not always an emphasis on the further things in life.
   <br>&emsp;To be fair though, much of my life has been charged with personal care, with the effect being one of choice. In that, our position at various time never held much more than novelty, and so we could go where chance or fortune brought us. And, as it were, the persoanl care and propiety which I sought and flourished from, held no damning limitation, particulary at home.
   <br>&emsp;For all are reared and prepped to go. But it is another thing to say there is discontent from such environment, and beyond the need to leave, they seek it. 
   <br>&emsp;For me, there were large droubts of content where I was at home, sipping off of our wider family fortune. Although there was occasional struggle, and our interest to be elsewhere gained, so was it a rather even period where I could focus on and relish myself.
   <br>&emsp;Because of this, our choices were never marshalled to any further end; nor, in times where we were independant, did we cement ourselves enough to naturally extend that way. 
   <br>&emsp;Some may forget, but often the return home is one of need or offer, in that by our novel state within a new place, so did the mere interest of being there not warrant any sense of permanency. Growth could occur, and indeed it often did. But by the whims of others and thier interest, my less than solid place was seen malleable. "Small needs of others then drew me, as neither party was reserved in changing place --in ask, or response."
   <br>&emsp;I would note then the friction of communcation during our independancy. For upon those periods of solidutde -and at home- we generally sought soemthing new and further. In this, to be fair, there were the minglings of dreams and destiny; along with the promise of change from the common mundaness and turbulence of being so close to family. While we did change in such ways, and earned much preference, there was always this sense of holding back from rushing forth. "As if some deeper plea to make the future more clear and defined came about, as the present was only clearer in being on our own. Our independance brought more certainty to the effects of our actions."  
   <br>&emsp;The trouble though, beyond ignorance, was that our fair attempt to proceed rationally, and at that contendely ahead, held a more apparent disdain from those around. Not, to be clear, in words, but our apprehension; as if our resolve within true being held the sense that others would find faults. Or, better said, that as our independance prompted us to further be ourself, that the concession to more truly and happily be, and not reach further and extend, drew embarrsement and contention from others (our sense at least). For it has never been my experienece that the ways and or good of virtue, integrity, deliberation or inquiry were either respected, praised, understood, or entirely accepted. 
   <br>&emsp;It is better to say that our being within such ways fell somewhat in line with the results that other common modes of being were measured against. And by that, some understanding and accpetence grew. But upon independance, we felt somewhat condemend for being our selves moreso. 
   <br>&emsp;One insight is that in such a course, of propiety that is, there tends to be less around which is either of interest of hospitable. And because of that, there is more reason to be yourself, and thus less involved with such things. "As if we were otherwise gasping for air, and held our breathe tigher; only though, to let go of the world around. Yet, we'd still see it, but from our point of view, as opposed to some future ahead."
   <br>&emsp;Where this has changed, is that what we see as contrary to being, is not itself so linited. Nor, is that state which we measure things agasint, based on avarice, fear or fame. In that, we see that our being has both time and place to exist and become. By that, there seems a fair lane ahead, full of different assortments of regard. Which bears much ease to the present.

<div id="butterbread">
   If you would, let us talk of butter and bread. For one is the matter, the substance of your life. But this, is not so clear, for do I mean the beat of your heart, the cheer in your way; or are we speaking of the task which draws such umph, or the field  in which you glee.
   <br>&emsp;We might say, that the latter notion is remarked in terms of bread, and butter the former.
   <br>&emsp;In that way, we can speak of life in general, and ours specifically. 
   <br>&emsp;First, I must submitt that our plate is enriched with the savourisest of cream, salted finely, and kept thick and fresh. And although our loaf is not so large, so is it of the purest seed; thorough grain, ample crust, but not in a way that makes you feel thick and rough, but rather firm, crackly, malleable to a pleasent degree. Thus my life is lined.
   <br>&emsp;In general though, it is not at all an unimportant point that we'd remark upon the means to 'churning' said cream. For life, as opposed to the fortune of family, is like wind on the crust, eroding it, thinning it, making it stale and dirty. And while the latter notion remarks the dollops of bran and grain, so is it the seasoning and condiment which makes it come alive. For a tired old man is not brought to the same level of cheer in even the most wonderous ways; but those who are at peace, but firmly happy and set, see more, and at that what would not be seen in less than preferable moments.
   <br>&emsp;It is true that a lack of family, home and friends will seperate one from what is deeply desired. But so mustn't we forget, that the world is farther than this; and as we ought be a certain way as not to be whithered by its erosion, and that in sobriety and thoughtfullness ought our time with such fortunes make such a must, that beyond such dear fortunes lie the candor and hues of the world, to which we ought be equally amnple in our ways to see it.
</div>
<div id="asenseofshame">
   So my dependance on my parents is more cirucmstance than any thing worth contempt. I have been on my own, and in that scenario, our state and aim in life was rightly just. At least, remarks about it held no swathing disdain as per our dependance. 
   <br>&emsp;And as for our current place as such, so were we asked.
   <br>&emsp;As regards family, I see it as unneccessary, strictly that is. That, and the time and state in which you form it, is not an obvious thing either; for one could choose to do so early or later in life; and so could it be much later --considering the abiulity to adopt. And its no small point to see that in our propiety, that generoisity is already so abundant, that the concentraed peak of a child is not eseential for fulfillment. A partner is otherwise someone you have, as is the case for comrades and friends. But a child may not be neccessary in terms of the requirment in it. That, or your contribution may be more civil then private. "For one can not raise a child, deeply, and also manage a nation. At least, time, oblige and effort are required on both ends; and it seems unfair to the child especially to rear it with your hand half way in another jar."
   <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, I am in this becoming state, whereby my place in the world or role in a family is per my actual self: for that is where my efforts are given from. In that, by some fidelity to a honored spot, ought you be more than capable in your means to give. And the first rule of that is in focus, in that you don't reach for things in order to serve the moment; rather to submitt yourself to them and all they need. In the way that you'd risk your life for the child, so is it the same in your effort and time across their development, that such attention would be sacrified for that. And ought you have the means and commitment to that.
   <br>&emsp;I find the notion of possibility a dreary one, for the proper regard for it is surely undefintivitve. My words, as proper, are not always shared or welcome by others, who seek things now. Nore is my reproach from things due to our candicay being premature something which is often praised or heard. Moreso, in our general scope of life -and such regards- we may find much work to be done personally, and inline with that, interests which were drawn to from such composure. This then, is not merely a question of orientation to a common subject, but a disregard for such object for the purpose of another. 
   <br>&emsp;In that way I find myself feeling disgraceful, as if our means to family is wrong, or too little emphasized ---as family being a goal in itself. 
   <br>&emsp;It should be noted that responsibility towards what is otherwise possible, as if we should work to make something happen, is not to do with happiness,  but duty; which seems to be drawn from some broader moral principle. 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, as the economy is a different mode of the otherwise social cooperation for sustenece, so is the idea of 'family' as a crux of society a somewhat ancient notion: pre economic if you will. 
</div>
<div id="trulyfull">
   So the background for lifes conduct comes down to the vector of possibility, and the all to likely change, and that of the material known to us, and what we can expect.
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, we may view something as sure and defined, or otherwise admitt the natural development we go through by simply experiencing things, learning then applying. That, and the world may change, in the ease in which your desires are met, and in how simple it is to handle oppertunites --be it old or new. 
   <br>&emsp;So will fortune accrue though, be it to your aid or not. And by that, it is not unessential that we regard the econmoical risks of what may come our way. But in life, there are definite ends, and sure ones at that. Ones, which in contrast to money, require the dedication to ourselves, as to prepare and grapple with such events. Whereas money leads one to apply themselves for the sake of such means, whereby the need for purchasing has a built supply, so lies the debts of illness, injury, death and loss. 
   <br>&emsp;And indeed, the common interest in eye care and dental, along with the general and or special care in terms of medicine and first aid, are all acceptable as desired things, neccessary even. But our future need not prepare for the purchase of a boat, or a car thats more than sufficient. Nor should we plan on trips, ventures, projects and or whims, that are based on absent understanding of what the world means.
   <br>&emsp;For in that, I cannot entirely say; nor do I mean to suggest it. But we can say, generally, that being so considerate of nature and your place in it, removes one from interests which spring themselves from the absence of such thoughts. I concede to the benefit and or need for basic things beyond that of shelter and food. But not much is worth but less.
   <br>&emsp;In this way the conduct of life is a struggle to dispense. For all my personal experiences mean not, if they are not pointed towards some true end. In that lies the conflict of liberty and activism, abstract versus concrete thought, reason at the cost of lethargy and contempt. And at any rate, all we have outside such truths, is a limitless address of the things we've known so far; which we can comment on at least. For I may not know this or that, but I can at least be commiserate to the path were on, and at that be aware of the terrain and our state; for we ought see where were going, what is not had which is needed; but so may we also rest on the things we do have, and how the experience has been thus far, settling into the troubles ahead as being not but hurdles for our legs to cross, or points of trouble which require the patience and fortuity that our time has already shown to have.

<div id="howwewere">
   My first jobs were techincially coaching and refing. The latter was stressfull, the former fufilling. My first real job was at Boston Pizza. From there I worked as a detailer, followed longer by a car washer; then as a delivery driver, sandpitt cleaner at Eagle Ridge, house painter, and a sushi maker at Save on Foods. In 2017 I left save on to work at Walmart as a produce associate; I did so for a year. I was hired for personal shopping near the end of 2019, and left October the following year. When I moved to Vancouver in 2022, I was rehired as personal shopper in August, and left early November in order to be with my Dad.
   <br>&emsp;Now, we are moving back, and surely for any and all reasons. We have too little money to move out, get hired, make an income, and bridge ourselves till the constancy of it is in place. Our mom and dad have not sold their home, and are taking on the mortage of a new one; and as it happens, including a month or two for completion, our current house may not sell till April, May or June even. It could be earlier, as Amy remarked that buyers wait to see which direction interests are going; she also mentioned that buyers may come at any time, late even. Our dad even said that the folks who wished to buy our house had some interest following their long drout of nothing. So it may sell; and surely, if we take it off before the years done, and put it back up soon into the new year, then it may sell then. 
   <br>&emsp;We are being told to work though, if only because any of our living expenses cannot be covered. The problem, is that if I get a job, accustomed and settled, then the course of doing this again is but another beginning. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, I have no modern grounds to sit on. For sure, many people succeed in the current age; but I am not convinced there happy; especially at least. 
   <br>&emsp;What I see, is that the times of old, and the ways born of them, hold no basis any more. The behaviour of people hasn't changed, only the value. But so in living, as it is fashioned to this day, so do people work for that as they would in the past. 
   <br>&emsp;And I have no immediate answer as to what I am doing different. Nor is it easy to be so forthcoming, and not get sucked into doubt, as to our current place and whether or not our prior actions were misplaced amidst the proper course of action: one, which it is not clear why the common route is not such.
   <br>&emsp;What brings it up for me is a sort of youthfull interest, and the balance of the world's need, and one's optimism that they can make their dreams come true according to that. Whereas a child who has no duty can openly see the world, youth are asked things, and at that, driven to see things in terms of duty and taste per the broader world. One, mind you, which is detailed with the tenants of family and social value. Whike a kids broad view is one of mere wonder. At least in their case, the extent of their view holds no boundires or commisioned regard; while youth, however open as per their reltaivley younger ways, has more formality and concern lined in  their vision. "Which is why children, seeing not but the stars, dream of reachinbg them; while youth think of their time and place with respect to ability, means, finance, ends."
   <br>&emsp;It might be an aid to submitt the basis of our duty and aim, which is along lines of family value. For nothing else holds so dear a spot as the basis for our kind. We may have worked together in different ways, and for different ends; but so as time and stability gained, was the constant of procreation and according relations bade. 
   <br>&emsp;With that in mind, and pairing the notion of modernity, the real question, by which our uncertainty rests, is of the manner in which our liberty should persits, with such family in mind. For on one end, there is the matter of one's natural proclivity to procreate, and the balance between electing to do so and the counterweight (of not doing so as early as possible) by those who happen to do so. In that, there is a lop sided statistic, which rightly suggests that, by our natural proclivity, that procreation will happen with either earnestness or happen chance via our natural bent. This is not an ideal, but an appeal to the populace need for procreation; and the stastical strenght in seeing this as likely by the common natures of folk -who are, and continue to be.

<div id="changedago">
   My roots are not so straightforward, but by whichever course, I came to see something good. 
   <br>&emsp;This came from a sense of propiety, which beyond the true beginning, had a earlier bout in similarly tough times.
   <br>&emsp;Because of this, my life has been a religous sort, in that our experience held the scale, or measure rather in which things were weighed against: whether that be as supportive, negativite, or, per the norms, relevant or not.
   <br>&emsp;That latter notion fairs the trick. For I may, in all liberty, choose to consume and practice what I please. But that I would make money, and the means for it at that, marks something a little different. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the transition between adolescence and youth was one of a idle conception, whereby the care for our experience cuold not be priortized at the abandonment of success. That is, our needs were not able to be satisfied without some sort of amends. "Literally, I sought to sleep outside."
   <br>&emsp;As it stands, I understand this now, but am also pressed by loose thinking. For our experience is all I care about. Nor are those needs and their means a damning hault. That, and our agreement to such means and the contentment to such ends, is not one which takes away from our experience. Beyond the passion which our oblige excites, and the coloring of our experience in such a dreamt way, so does the stability and space affored by our place in life, both prompt and service our experience, and at that delight it. For such occupations, however civil, are part of our experience, and at that afford us different textures and sight. Moreso, as our recent days have shown, that such a commisery, of mere stabilyt and experience, has no need or trajectory of stationlessness or promise. For we may apply ourselves, find goods beyond ourself in romance or friends; and at that, per our fuller wants, and complimentary needs --within such a life-- we can invovle ourselves in recreation or public affairs; be that churhc, free yoga, drop in sports and community involvment.
</div>
<div id="lastgrip">
   When I start with our experience in mind, I hukbly oblige the missing holes of our knowledge; not at all out of respect, for why would truth need any, but as a remark of what may in fact be wise for us to concern. 
   <br>&emsp;For the complexion of such experience may not define the broader structure of it; and at that, per one's intent to oblige, may our current amends be less fair in the future than they are now. As we mentioned, there was a point in 2018 where we thought that our duties were stearing us away from our experience, or piking it into the ground at least, by which we sought to ascend. But in seeing that we could not, so doth our adulthood lay. My point though, is that when we mark our experience as the aim of our regard, that so are broader interests or needs beyond the present worth addressing, as to fairly enstate ourselves within our current action. For most advice is based on the future and what your current actions are oppertune to treat -or prepare rather. And it is one thing to say that the present is fine via simplicity; but of the future and what we are more or less fine to consider, that so does the common view of the present hold an equal norm in the future. OUr present care and grasp of the present absolves according cocnerns or guidance (for some other aim); but so lingers the norms of the future.
   <br>&emsp;This creates an all mighty reservation. For less we remove ourselves from the matters central to such future, or we let such future come to be, and happily via our simple (and forseen as such) conduct, then we are left with a sort of ignorant and or defiant relation to what is ahead. Most folk, and tradition on the whole, stands from such a view, that of what is to come, that the past has already been privy to such; of which those so indetted offered their history with such.
   <br>&emsp;We could bring it together like this. Experience is a matter of quality, in that your time, be it from within, or by its relation to some task, is both sturdy and secure, but rich and tender too. As it were though, the promotion of such is not something, despite the core means, which can be mitigated entirely by such means; for as means, they need a person to exhibit them, and at that be alive; for which our needs our measured by [our ability to meet such standard and exhibit ourselves]. And the take away is that as measure is more or less based upon home and food, that so in natural and moral need, do the matters of family and community lay.
</div>
<div id="rumblingsaround">
   I've heard politics regarded as childish, and media as garbage; yet those some folk are curious, and at that elated at the means for knowledge.
   <br>&emsp;For starters, being unsure and holding steady within such uncertainty is much preferred then to evaluate the world on by those sources; by your own admission their poor. But in this, lies the need for reproach, as one must deliberately examine the world, through writing, inquiry and purer sources; and as such, must sit in reproach, before fuller opinions are made.
   <br>&emsp;We make for our experience though, and by that, when the words of politics and publicists are being told, and friends, family or communal sentiment is in response, so do we sit on our own examinations; by their virute, and their contrast to those scattered words.
   <br>&emsp;In this though lies some vulnerability, for seeing those frustrated, opinioned or unnerved about the world leaves an idealistic scent in air, as if it is our role to attend to such troubles, and at that not be so ignorant as to not be so. By this, I can permitt so form of generosity, be it active or in virute; one being a invovlment in such affairs, the other being a behavior of agreeableness, as to consent and assimilate to changes made for the broader good. "This will help," you hear, and you thus situate yourself to that for the common good. 
   <br>&emsp;There is a tricky aspect though, namely our rebellious mind, or that of removing hurdles and power; which differs then educating folks or protest, or that of submission; but rather evokes a sort of defiant removal, as to not merely improve, or yield to imrpovement, but to tear down those responsible. 
   <br>&emsp;I am not so agreeing to this aspect of fighting. For one, my sense of it is incomplete; while the other, is that our view of the world is an examined one; and due to the size of the world, in both time and breadth, we more often than not sit in a state of consideration, rather than approach. I admitt that this is but the present, and our idea at least of how active we should be -and in the ways we can- is progressing. But I don't much admitt the 'less than examined' -in reality or as seemd- conceptions of the world. No one is forcing us to work in camps, or removing our right to speech, assembly, guns even. All there is really, is a world whos antiquated roots has born conflict, despite the collective harmony of the broader powers. And at that, lies econony, or the vectors for people to recieve and exhibit liberty. By this, sits interest rates for mortage and loans, and the lever of taxes (for various groups). One's professional conduct is one thing, but ought our fears of this not be so condensed; nor ought we confuse a specific scenario with that of the broader world. The United States is not going to war with Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy, Africa, Australia, India or France. They could war with Russia or China; but the merrits of that which rest on specualtion, and of a far sort, seem like sparks on an otherwise dense world. Moreso, ought our fear of that, be mature when it comes to the projected loss; and unceded to ignorance as regards nuclear weaponry; as such matters merey concern more loss, or a definite point of destrcution. "But so the concern of death lay, in which a unhazy or sprawled view lets one see the actual place of conflict. Which, alotghet, is one that our own warless life is set for."

<div id="atrueman">
   So my time in the recent era has been one of vagrancy. At least, I resort to such when a stationary life feels to slow and small. The path in this, to be clear, is not one of much variety, as our temporary stay always amounts to staying with family. 
   <br>&emsp;I do so though with no future in mind, and their allowance. But as of late, I've felt that our taste of such vagrancy, paired mind you with our family prescence, is not either sought or ideal.
   <br>&emsp;Normally the thinking is that, if our experience is key, then removing accessory responsability will furnish our means and enjoment of that. As it were though, the limitations of doing so on our own are no longer there, nor are the concessions of being near family as permitted.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the hope of mine has been to turn our love into dreams, whereby the care to do so was furnished by some encumbent substance. "Like my fancies were made into something beyond themselves, as to support them." Besides the drama in doing so, the real issue was that, as the future was brought to mind, or the matter of our satiety, so did I clinch at the thought of being so still and stable, yet small in our experience. That is, our means were never that far, and by that, offered not much more than the mere means to be; yet such being was halted, or at least sequestered via the bounds of such means. "Like a I couldn't see or dream naturally, as our future held nothing but the mundanity of our means."
   <br>&emsp;What changed is that our idea of what experience requires, and the dissolving of outward limitations, made it so the common sway of our means was not so limiting. Not only in space, but motion, as per possibility, means of acquaintence, and normal paths for community. And because of this, our privation for the sake of experience was held with less reverence. For despite the freedom to truly be, there lacked much substance; and at that, only forced me to be even more, as to make do with less substance. "Like I were squiting my eye in order to see more around me." 
   <br>&emsp;Now, as it stands, that need to squint is no longer sought; and such a feeling is elevated by the consenting sight of stable means, which remove such need to squint, and through their lack of restrictivness; which, in itself, was something I experienced in terms of having a rich time, without so much interference from things once sought damning. By yielding to the common rungs of the world, there is immediatley more possibility. And at that, our feeling of ware upon our squint, is given room and reason to end; as there lies a suitble, promising and lively place outside dependancy. 
</div>
<div id="hopeforclarity">
   I have some loose thoughts, but some no less. Centering primarily on the balance between public and private discource. 
   <br>&emsp;As I see it, there's this (albeit fair) tendency to attribute media production as a sort of linch on the corportions and governments of the world. "Like those speaking are rallying up the citizens, who then rally to make demands; and the governmetns all sweating, tossing here and fro in order to amend."
   <br>&emsp;But our rational view does not portray this; even though our experience, in brief even, of media is otherwise concluding.
   <br>&emsp;In part, the issue lies in the orientation of our regards, whereby the press is in one sense deemed a constituent of the public, similar to the way that governments are in an administrative sense. But it is important to know, that the press is not an essential feature of a system, as the management of state affairs are seldom done in referendum or disclosure. Indeed those enacting such affairs are chosen, and by that representatives; but in lew of old comparisons, the sentiment is one of trust and the extent to which it can be given; and so much as it cannot, so lies the press' purpose.
   <br>&emsp;This is all fair and good. The issue comes in when our understanding of the state (and its features) runs short, and the seeming presence of the media becomes one of contrast to such state. As our emotions regarding the govenrment -short of virtue and patriotism- are negativie. That is, they are akin to one's care for a parent, in that they love them, but dislike them, as the sense of discipline is always on the line. While one's relationship with the media is generally positive; for they never ask, but show where your authorities are mistaken. They may even say their wrong. "As one's reprieve from their parents is not so much a dismissal and or rebuke, but frustration. In youth, one tends to rebel, namely by their developed posutre and sense." And it is a lapse of knowledge on my part which leaves the media as seeming to conjure such confidence in the public. 
   <br>&emsp;And the consequence is not one of actual disruption, but sentiment. "No matter the woes andc cries of folk, Wall Street keeps running, money keeps talking, and officials conduct their adminstrative and civil affairs." The trouble, is that as one who is both ignorant and sensible, I wish to either learn, and at that suspend my judgements until having and understanding; or I sit with the impressions of the world steadily, remarking upon their minor effects within the breadth and time of our state. But when people are complaining, or you get the sense that they are, then you feel like your 'less than critical and or indifferent' view of things is unacceptable. This is fine, and per the norm, a fair condition to have. But our ignorance acts as a hole in which our composure escapes. For instance, if there is a perceived sentiment of an officials licentiousness, then our ignornace of how officials are impactful will leave me somewhat unable to rest on the irrelevane of said persons behavior; for such grievence is not a true remark of their civil effect. Indeed there is room for such grievence, but per the points to do with such behavior. And the common effect, by me at least, is that with such an vicious stain, that such offical is seen as incapable, or better yet an antagonist within their civil action. And I, having some sense, know that the behaviour in question does not mean, in all likelihood, or in relevance, that their civil efficacy is off. A matter of ethics sure; but that the both would and could turn the lever is not essentially diminished by their licentiousness. If I don't know about such civil action though, generally I'd say, then I have a hard time resting on such notion. For, in all fairness, I seldom feel so anarchic or afraid as public sentiment can seem. But in appearing so, I am only more pushed to be steady in our own sensible view. Indeed our life can procurre such indifference by its own motions and 'ingestion' of media. But so much as I do view it, and have this farce reaction, so do our definitions lie. And if they are empty or loose, then I am left standing with the sense that nothing is wrong, but not then able to say why things are all right. "The public is afraid, or acting against some malignancy which I do not see. But I do not knwo what there is otherwise. As if someone said that God created the world, and that such a claim was so by neccessity; and I may say sure, in admittence, but that such a claim was empty. Or better yet, that I did not align with such view naturally, but had no other which I did. "  Such struggle we'd define and say, is about a subjection to falsity, or claims at least which are not whole, principled (and at that from inquiry, and thus suggestive), but then not having something of your own which is defined. For you end up refuting such claims on their baseless, rather than denying them on some truer measure. 
   <br>&emsp;In that though, lies one who heeds no rush to finish their quilt; or at that lacks any taste or happiness for their effort. But when someone comes in and rattles the piece so far, it fairs both petty grievence and more serious aversion as to the welcomenedness of rough action upon a working piece.

<div id="balanceofold">
   When I was younger, I cared most about being myself. Being so young, I had no alternative sense. But, compared to fire, scenarios which seemed to draw me out of that state were more or less hot, and an aversion. 
   <br>&emsp;When I got older, circumstances came about whereby we'd recieve the means to further ourselves, and I'd say no. And upon reflection, a core reason was that, without indisputable amounts of cash, that your realization of those ways would fall short; we saw awkwardness in the scenario, and a fairly reproached place from our parents serving us in that full way. For if we worked to make this form of life happened, then I would be alright and unembarressed. But as it were, when I was young even, the means for me to do so were not there or apparent; and having to ask our mom and dad felt like gathering lingering sticks to make a fire; the flame of which, by that method, felt unstable. And from that doubt, led to a fear of change, as if I would become someone different, but in a state of want of such things. 
   <br>&emsp;Instead, I choose to do nothing, and remain by myself. I never lacked friends and ability; but so as they amended themsevles for women and fun, I was  left alone. Better yet, I transitioned into caring for those things primarily, but was in a rather minnowed state in terms of means. I became a sort of tag along, hitching off of other peoples car and booze.
   <br>&emsp;As I got older though, this way of living led to despair. I recall one point where I was fully working, and had unparamount means to splurge; and doing so truly felt rewarding. But as that situation eroded, and our means became smaller and challenging, so did I care little but for a indulgence which was binge worthy. Prior, we'd drive around, have fun and be a light. While in this, I wished only to be alone, or a mile away from a party, and consume things for satiety rather than fun.
   <br>&emsp;The balance seemed to be the thing which was off. For our full amends brought with it a sort of confidence; the opposite of which brought embarassment and doubt, as if I merely thought of fun, but relied on others to provide it for me.
   <br>&emsp;This is one end of things. And indeed, our full time at work and the full means of fun around it, marked what is the otherwise path of teenage fufillment. And by that, what I failed to reach the years prior. But as the work slipped, so did the fun; and by that, what we sought changed to. We became private in our interests; and despite the substance remaining, our care for it became less outward and exuberent, but personal, in the way I cared about games and noraml food. "Smoking weed became a sort of inhaler, of which I had no interest in doing it in some elaborate way; and even though this would occure, as smoking was so desired, I much preferred to be in a comfier sitatution while doing it."
   <br>&emsp;For whichever reason, this mode of life did not continue. Namely because the use of weed was depleting, and our shorter means around were noticbly small. When I went to college though, I found that or aim of it was bare. And despite enjoying the tasks, the purpose of them was empty. And so the reality of applying ourself had so little to contirubte, beyond our natural interest, that we became depressed; as it was like wishing to leave a post, in intent at least -for I did not mind showing up. 
   <br>&emsp;Following this, we were exposed to the brevity of nutrition, noticing through some article that mussels had 12000% vitamin B12, and Kale with 1000% vitamin K. Me and my friend were so intrigued, as if a sort of richness was in front of us. Unfortunatley though, despite gaining much personally, we focused so much on turning such interests into something profitable. Only, our care for such things lied so deep and at hand, that the seperation from the outer world which spurred us to see such things, held no place for us to bring such things into fruition. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the desire to be in that outer world is one best characterized by security and fun, and unweildingly as not to be impassioned but elated -like were seeking more than ingrained. But as said, we were not in such lands, or much in line with them. Being was not clear or easy otherwise, which was why, as is sometimes portrayed in peoples conversion to religion, that doing things central to ourselves was itself a sort of application. In a similar way, upon breaking up with our girlfriend and loosing friends, we stirnly applied ourselves to schooling, and took up a consistent workout regime. And of note, when we ended up changing schools and finding more friends, our outwardly place became more secure, and our personal interest wained.
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, we did not create that buisness, as we only had excitment for such things, but held no definite means or care to bring them beyond ourselves. The point I'm getting at, is that our wish to do so was one akin to being offered money, and the elation which comes with that. In getting older, I can see that a steady and secure place within yourself removes the otherwise outward interest, or sensitivity rather, by which forward or deep means to such fruition are attached to.

   So I have some lust, and perhaps rightly so. I see craiglist personals, eharmony like sites, POF like sites, and other things of the sort. At the very least we can pursue something, or be invovled, and at that, have some sort of priority beyond ourself; which I believe will help in being more discrete at work and recreation.
   <br>&emsp;This pleausre though is consuming, and I see nothing else. And oddly, besides our experience, I cannot quite explain why this is not the soul aim. For the reason to do it is paramount, like warmth in the cold. 
   <br>&emsp;Yet our days have only shown, by neccessity maybe, how being steady within yourself is not only satisfying, but reassuring to any of the desires who abscence sprung us to be more self content; and, we are quite fufilled with such development, for nothing feels better than working on yourself. That, and we don't feel idle so long as we have this aim; for there is never so much you can do, nor any time to stop it. 
   <br>&emsp;But the true promise of this is liberty. For one who needs the world will not have much luck less fortune bears the way. And even if they held the kingdom's crown, so would it not feel enough. While Cretes walked around happily in a theadborn robe; or Socrates, who responding to Melinulus' claim that Athens was expensive, showed him that barley was a minced amount compared to the olives and wine which he sought, and at that measured expenses by.
   <br>&emsp;In all manners, the fruit of glory, gluttons and loins, is but a inflammed moment, heated, somewhat impassioned; but the moment goes like each point of a stream; leading one to become somewhat disposed, and angled towards another moment. While self regard and content, by it's own merrit, seeps one into a state of rest and tranquility; something of which is, in practice, lost only by contrary efforts or a lapse of producing ones; nor do the effects of such balanace loose their appeal upon use, both in reliability of the means, and their saturation. "For as I paint my pallete with sweets and wine, so does the same taste mundane. While the crsip feeling of a steady morn, looses none of its endearment or appeal; nor do the means to such freshness loose their stature as being so productive, and at that value and appointment."
   <br>&emsp;All in all, liberty is our claim from being propietous. For the world may grant fortune; but not even death is excluded from the emperor's call. And at that, I am not sure what remarks we have about wishes and ends that don't fall beneath that? 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, liberty is what occurs when one is free enough to live well; in that, the latter notion marks a cease of hostility; while the former marks a sentiment of fertility and faciliation. For none, in the freest state, can inherently paint, or reconigze the details of wonder; or at that, find a sort of peace and steadyness found by right actions. For the matters which give them leave to such pursuit, do not imbide them with the qualities they seek. As a removal of famine, and at that an offer of plentiful food, does not inscribe the proper use of that. Being fed versus not is a matter of freedom, for the brightest star could not pull you away from starvation. But upon satiety, or the ability to do so, the actual amends for liberty, or reasonable goods, come to pass. For it is not only a state which needs moderation; in that food was on offer and you needed to select 'wholer' kinds. For even if whole kinds were all that was available, this still would neither A) account for other choices which held moderate means, and B) actions which were not only good because they were not something altenrativley bad, but actual productive. In that way, positive amends are what liberty feeds off of. For in despair, one cannot even survive; and are at best lucky to breathe. But upon such breathe, they may attempt to overcumb such need. Upon doing so though, beyond being free, there are accomodations within the matters of such need --such as keeping to foods rather than indulgent ones-- along with efforts which produce the stations for richer goods. As painting is not embellished by a mere steady hand, but a practiced one. Even the sights which spurr you to the page, can be seen in a finer light. For one's interest in representing death, no matter the heart, no matter the trade, still require an understanding of what it is; at least, in their attempt to further see it through their craft, ought they reflect on the parts they already know. "For there is surely some characterizing feature which makes it distinct from life: but in that, ought one delicately know." 
   <br>&emsp;In that, one in need cares not for the goods of consumption or liberty, but the filling of their stomach. Upon such satiety, they may be prepped for richer kinds of satiety, and at that, the exhibition of wants which spiral off from the deeper needs.  But in the land of reason, lies a fuller kind of being, namely that of expression and receptivity. For the vanity of consumption is not all to hard to detail; but we can say, in comparison, that it is not so delightful by the abscent terms which expression and receptivity offer. In those, your in motion like consumption; only one is falling over, seeing only what is exciting their passion, and more than not likely unable to be much more upon completion. While the other is light and tender; and albeit not so heated and alloyed, so is the initial step one of dear fancy, rising up to a fairer mark in terms of substance, but like the ends of a storm still winding away. The fruits of our loin  come to pass, leaving us to seek more; while one in the purer kinds of motion, be it of dance, words or craft, tend to remain so, ably and happily. Moreover, the dearest part of this, for those at least who have lust the youtfull means or interest in such lust, is that through and upon such tender attentions, one is treated to the all mighty posture of rest; whereby the effect is not one of past pleasure and more to come, but a satsifcation which lets one peacefully be: as if they'd truly one. For in that, the tips and tats of our writing and craft pitter along, picking up to their own fuller strides; but so in our heart and mind do we settle, gently, but whole and solidly too. And be it the cooling wind, or the heat of a summer day, so does the fuller grooves of your craft wear little upon a lack of means or time; for the strides prior have given you the strenght from what you'd already done. "While those moves to cheese, sex, fame and wine, care only for more; or worse, sit uneasily if there's none."
</div>
<div id="strengthfornot">
   In all fairness, meeting your lusting needs is no small task. If it were so simple, then the comparison between expression and receptivity would be one of quality; at least qualities of taste and consistency, over accesibility.
   <br>&emsp;But the truth of the matter is that having sex, eating rich food, purchasing wonderful things, is no small cost. Or, better yet, that compared to expression, which bears satiety in even failed attempts, the route to such consumptions are not so definite; rather you must try and chase, and deal with the unease until such excess.
   <br>&emsp;For I see that consumption is like a splinter, throbbing till its dislodged. And in that way, I say nothing ill of sex or food, but gluttony, distaste for whole things, and horniness. For these things cloud your mind and spirit, rustling you till their goal is finished. And indeed there is room for excitment, along with pleasure, but it ought not thwart the rest of your life.
   <br>&emsp;The reality though is that sex is hard to come by. At least, in our younger years, we were somewhat embarrassed by the natural means we had, and not those which bore sparkle to your attraction. In many ways I saw the means to such sparkle as futile and dumb; and thus we steared away from their ends completely. In good sense, the right statement is one that says, by your natural goods, that you offer them without comparative pretense and shame, or at that, exagerated needs which such 'pretenses' are based on. "For the vain idea of beauty, in hotness namely, does expect more than those natural needs. Yet all people have beauty, and at that, hold room for attracion. And the relations born of this need less than those grandeur displays."
   <br>&emsp;Indeed our life can be summed up by a balance of cynic complacency, fair reprieve from superflous and taughty showmanship, along with a sort of crushed despair between the ultimate bounds of which our 'hot interests' were moderated by, and the otherwise expression of that range of cynicism into the dislike and disinterest in working for such consumptions, but in a moderate lane. 
   <br>&emsp;For our mom and dad never let the future and our current prepeartive duties slip away. And by that, all I saw was a life employed towards that. And such a life was not one I yearned for. And so, the youthfull efforts which would serve my hotter interests, were not embellished due to our sense of duty being reproached from; as such a sense was marshalled agasint the broader parts of our life: and our swerve from those saw me swerve from those which were more novel and fruitfully fun.
</div>
<div id="whitheredconsumption">
   Coming from this is an over reliance on liberal goods. For our aversion to the norms, and at that an unremarkable attempt for consumption, meant that, in purpose and satisfaction, that the goods of reason were emphatically there. 
   <br>&emsp;The value of this is hard to explain. As the terms used ultimately remark feelings that are not themselves easily expressed. That, or as clear as they are, the sentiment is not compelling. For the pleasure of sex, or comfort of food, is something we know and can relate to. While the solidity one feels while writing inquiries, playing games, relishing shows and film, is not something which holds much insight to the feeling involved. We understand what a good film is, and why thats enjoyable; as are creative efforts somewhat clear in their delight. But these two fall short of any real insight; as we are simply comparing our own time watching a movie, and relating that to the supposed feeling another had while they watched one. And whereas the taste of food and hottness of sex is something that, as an experience, is understood, or at least grapsed as something desired within the activity of food and sex, the actual feeling of watching a movie and things of the sort is not equally understood. Despite our grasp on the activity. 
   <br>&emsp;Foremost do I say this, for the feeling in question is not so universal. As one may be flipping through channels, unervingly unable to rest and enjoy, while another is hooked, satiated by the beginning of the episode, and elated by its finish; and then unable to wait for following previews. These are different experiences within the realm of televsion. And at that, one watching the same show as another may have a different experience. For you may have seen something before, and have sort of interest or respect for the material in play. And by that, like a performance seen before, or better yet, like a roller coaster you've been on previoulsy, 'throw up your hands, this is the best part!'.
   <br>&emsp;The passions of consumption are in themselves consuming. For the roaring embers of your loins cloud all other cares and judgement; and at that, hover around for anything which can please your excitment. But age and duty lessen the proclivity for such flames. And at that, offer the experiences of pleasure, but not their inflammed excitment. And from that, beyond the satisfaction such pleasure brings, lies around the rest of your time and ways. The points at which, must be filled for living to be claimed.
   <br>&emsp;My life was such, that that proclivity for excitment was not abily or happily enacted. And so we fondled around, privatley contenting ourself, or mopely despairing over the lack of goods our excitement sought. And indeed from this came much envy towards those seemingly endowed with such affairs. 
   <br>&emsp;It would not be unfair though, that our amends in those days was towards the unmitigating task of school, and its day to day and long term needs. Considering this was our chore, I only wanted free time and comfort with respect to it. And getting girls, partying, things of sort, only came from a job; at least extending yourself into such realm. But doing so brought me outside of the harmony I had with school. In that I would go, do my work sufficiently, then retreat to my points of comfort. Indeed, had I a definite and or extended view of such schooling, than perhaps the goods for that would lead into those loinfull goods. Better yet, considering the merrit of school, and this aversion to abandoning that for the sake of composure needed to have fun elsewhere, that applying myself more for school, and at that gaining composure from that, would more than likely led to those funner goods, but sourced from that composure born of more merritbale extension. 
   <br>&emsp;I never did this though. And besides the factors which led that way, and paired mind you with the mindset which understandibly came from such influences, so did our youth lay, in that we did not embellish our oblige to school in any capacity beyond the point of sufficiency. "As if to make it seem, and at that validate ourselves, by the most minimal stake." But this did not lead to much more than an enormous vista of oblige upon graduation; for we were then asked, and at that personally placed, to do something with ourselves. As if the point of school had been reached, and set us off to the subsquent chapter. But I had barely finished the book; at least I had skimmed through enough to get through school. But upon the next book, our ability and care to read was so minimal, that the tasked seemed a burden. Especially because, in that large oblige, lied no real desire or end from me. And although this describes all yet too little, It can say that our prep in life failed, upon which our motions through the stalemate which followed led to the interest and care for the lane which were still part of. 
</div>
<div id="rockyflair">
   I feel fair in remarking the motions of liberal goods and consumption, as being fit for analysis through the measure of elation, and how the swerviness of such is no good thing to have; and at that, prone to misinterpration in the way that 'the excess' portion (or upswing) is used as a opponent to the otherwise steadyness of liberty; but in that lies confusion regarding the starting point of such excessity, whereby one goes from a plausible equal point as one whose temper is otherwise calm; and in that case, the high from that standard is not so redeeming, in particular when you consider the actual form of such swing (in terms of quality and width), and the more simple notion of 'the downswing', the result of which is often an upheavel back to the standard; which too, holds its own shape and hue. 
   <br>&emsp;In such sense, the flairs of elation, both up and down, are not so desired when you consider the wholesome plunder within a virtuous state, and at that the bitter taste of the downswing and upheavel. 
   <br>&emsp;I have worked through a near arm and a leg to describe such sentiments in my life. For support is an all to forgotten privalge; in the sense that nature is out to get us, and we hold so much which is worth feeling dear about when it comes to our family and friends who stand by us through our response. But that we would live per those descriptions, marks the fact that our life has peered away from what is normal, and at that prone to the wholest of supports. As it were, our time has been such, that our care for virtue has come from a sort of parched resolve, in that the goods of elation were a farce to me. But absent of virtue as well, we were left with an experience which was all worthy of contempt. Only, our cultivation of virtue, as if a commisery to ends worthy of what we were otherwise averse too (in elation), brought with it a fully integral lane for us; which itself, albeit unpitiful, still lacked the acceptence that our elated success would receive.
   <br>&emsp;Now I stand with much understanding, having ruled the cynic and beggar in me; as not to fold under the lack of support amidst the world, or begrieve those who offer at best their neutral hand. "Who are never elated themselves for our prowess in virtue; merely accepting, and at that ready shame me upon the slightest slip beneath our proclaimed status." But in that lies that the true course of our way, that through the bare embrace to virtue, and our albeit fair yet, in better terms, humble naivety, clambered the currents of care and amends. For in that, ran a dear friendship, between man and himself, through which the world was seen. 
   <br>&emsp;And all our 'descriptions' serve, is a ledger of reasons and defense as to why said stream ought continue flowing. Only, in heartfull matter I know, merrily, that being is all I need. 
   <br>&emsp;"And the lie in life, is that solutions to your problem are in fact the proper course for action; for in my accounts, they are but bracings to the apprhensions born of not being; the strides of which need no candor or stake."
</div>
<div id="localabide">
   I submitt to all that I have no morals. In whole, I have our own mere interests, and nothing else worth commends.
   <br>&emsp;Our sympathy is not barren though, merely our contribution. 
   <br>&emsp;In that, I simply attend to our common matters, namely of virtue, family and friends. 
   <br>&emsp;Where I am no maligned is in our placement within an illustrious world, which holds neither detail in time, nor breadth within the integrity of it. This is the commercialized view, the picterqsue one. And this I do no oblige, for it marks no the bits of world strung together into earth, mammal and man, but rather the theory, tale and practice of it all.
   <br>&emsp;I am a cynic, and by that fair deficit, admitt only to our curmudgen acceptence of those who critique such matters; and be it with respect or passivity, so do I accept. But  of those who blundgeon me with my lack of knowledge or amends in a current world, but not a substantial one, to that wince not at our ill-commission.
   <br>&emsp;Nucleaur weapons may be used, so be it; as may floodings, typhoons and droughts increasingly occur, so be it; as is crime similarly postered, so be it. This is for the governments of the world to align, and at that the citizens to accept the prospective change. Education is fair, as fair accounts of those who say one thing and mean otherwise; but we ought not pretend like we are anything but what we are, be it the chief executive, secretary of finance, civil employee or resident of the state. "Let virtue breathe commradery, and at that open mindedness to the routes by which we exhibit resourcefullness; and at that, an equal receptivity to other's proposed problems."
   <br>&emsp;It is said that philosophy, as in all guidance, is aimed at one thing only: to fear not the future, and in all practicality, accept and bestow the ways into death, and at that senility. But so in our common fears, whereby we fret at the commerce of states, or the flamboyance of corporate officials, does the source of our discontent lie in sympathy. For I truly care not what the government gives and takes from me; for by all accounts, my life is fostered by employment and oppertunity. What really irks me, is seeing others in despair, or subject to violence during conflict; these sightings breathe a fury in me, 'and purge me towards the state culprit'. 
   <br>&emsp;But so in fear of death and the soul gain of wisdom in guiding us through it, that so in our sympathies to other people, and at that the empathy within that as our similar perrils compare, do we need an equal kind of guidance, or wisdom rather, as to be less elated in our fears and struggle; on par with the sentiments which wisdom produces in order to level out our fears and bearing of death.
   <br>&emsp;I know not the pain of severe injury, nor the taste of dust as I sleep woefully on the floor. "My own floor is covered with rugs and linens." I can say though, that our sympathy's sprout as our own struggle ceases. And by that, lies a kindred side to the sense which offers peace through death, whereby the sense of propiety and neccessity spurr an equal economic, and by that worldy grace. 
   <br>&emsp;In that though, per our current place, lies one who is endeared to all, if not for a generous angst. For despite our lack of struggle, and a tender sense of the goods I seek, purely, so do I lack much composure when our sympathy for others is flared up. More than that, we are not in any real sense contributing; which offers no grip on the matter. 
   <br>&emsp;What I can say though, that as erotic images flair our libedo, and at that elate what is otherwise a calmer and contendted passion, that so in the media lies a unfettered source as to elate your fear for the sake of others; and at that, the irritation at others causing it.
   <br>&emsp;And in all ignornace your justness and integrity may lack; but from an understanding which is proportioned and substantiate. "We mustn't measure towns with mile long sticks, for the units become small; nor can the world be represented in anything but miles; yet what I see is a limit to that broader extent, with smaller and fainter measures added onto it, but in no way enough to be circumspect." 
   <br>&emsp;I struggle then, in that of the worlds enormity, my sympthaties are clouded out, for in no fair way can I deeply see. Yet I am somewhat on par with the pace of things, in all there might, and merely keeping along; all the while things occur naturally, and we coalesque with our natural increase of attention and care. Yet when we read or here dramtic statements, we are thrown a little, as if the problem which the world presented was in fact near and clear. I struggle though in seeing this, if only because our sense is otherwise when we are not in view of a small world. For in our greater studies, I keenly compared our sights and senses which are wholesome and appropriate, and those which are righteous, naieve and condensed. 
</div>
<div id="farhappenings">
   We have our truth, and the exploration of it through inquiry. And indeed my desire lies in that course.
   <br>&emsp;But via our sympathies, we somewhat hanker over it, and at that run ourselves over. Indeed our sympathy and or fear is exasterbated by our consumptions and state, but there the question lays: why are we so drawn to our sympathies, or moved by them rather. 
   <br>&emsp;It may be true that what we mean by sympathy is like a stomach ache a 1000 miles away, and we, in line with our own aches and being, trust and or accept them as being per their own place. We are all on the same stream, but each of us our rowing, and less someone is drowning besides you, those far around hold no means or need of oblige. "Indeed our parched sense of those around such people makes it seem like their perrils are unbounded by support, and antagonism at that."
   <br>&emsp;In other words, we have the truth, a path to it in the way that a garden is but a blossoming place, yet the value of this is unclear. Again, I feel it comes from our sympahty, whereby the self regard which empathy affords, wherein you share someone's struggle, but thereby hold warrant to priortize yourself, ceases. At that point, you are, by all abscences, free and liberal. 
   <br>&emsp;The truth though, is that we are somewhat sensible to the worlds despair, in the way that we concern ourselves not with every death, in animal or man. Nor we do account for all accidents, injuries, payments and frustrations. Even a rampant genocide is hard to express; for our efforts feel at best communicative, rather than adversarial. It seems right that our understanding sympathizes with those who are misfortuned amidst natures growing ways, all the while knowing that it is from such growth that the misfortune occurs. And from that, our attiude, contributively, is never gripped by financial aid, as the tempests of the situation are at best dulled. Minorly even; though there is merrit in the means for repair. But we somewhat sit here complacent, resting on the reality which produced this, by which, compartively, we accept like a natural disaster -whereby we hold no blame. Nor does this foreign sense, by which through natures flow we trust (is the cause), do we see the actual misfortune any other way; for in that we equally trust, that there is real, as opposed to illustrious struggle.
   <br>&emsp;In that sense I am wrong. For my mother and father, gautning over the news, pronged in their worldly sense, hold a reaction which is in fact fair. As for the reason, I cannot entirely say. And per our dissedence to such cause, so am I, as in all shortcomings of perfection, understandibly unoritented to such reason, due to our 'less than pronged' impression.
   <br>&emsp;There though lies the care for truth, as it lets me comfortably and suitably be. Perhaps it is it's own prompt for inquiry, of our contribution. For I may be best and right to join military operations, to volunteer in Africa, teach ESL, or something more community based and local.
</div>
<div id="mineandother">
   I might, with literary indulgence, spread our tenants of experience. In a four quadrant view let's say.
   <br>&emsp;For one, there lies joy; along with the marshalling of it. Then there is struggle, meaning our imperative deed to nature. "For not I or any man alike can fake a grasping breathe without airs prescence." Then their is trauma, or better put, the hues of the world; which might be better defined as the contents of the furthest conception. And then, nicely, lies rest; whereby we see no misfortue or foreign grievence.
   <br>&emsp;This latter comes quite easily; but it requires a mixture of integral relief from understanding the world, and at that properly stating it's trauma, and at that plea for you to contribute -or sympathize. But alongside this, sits the mob, or common sentiments, and how these, in the push to solitude and or (fair) dependence, causes a grinding friction between you and that 'percieved pedantry and elation'. 
   <br>&emsp;Aside that balance of peace and true sentiment, lies the mirror of joy and struggle. For in one, you are burdened, and at that stripped away. While the other, you have the treats of life for your attention, and at that the self interest to remark upon such travels. "As if I know where I am going, within my freedom and her aim towards such good." Sometimes though, when the balance of sympathy is high, and our peace is more latched onto rather than situtated upon, then our joy feels more novel, and at that a glimmering promise; and by that, despite the sparks of hope which our moment of peace affords, so deep down lies our honest conset to the tears and thicket below. 
   <br>&emsp;And perhaps virtues greatest claim is the blossoming  from wise integrity; whereby those brambles are tended, the esscence of such being ethics; and by that, our means to remove ignorance and naievity is equal to our means to explore our dearest treats; all mind you, by the proportioned relation to the world, whereby said removal of bare mindedness raises you above the otherwise small minded frustration with things, and at that the pin on your own peace: the description of which, can best be stated as a formative stance through the world, by which our sight is on all things, and at that prudent for your own deeds, and the sympathy of others. For the proportion of that regard leads your attention to actions which are suited within a completely viewed world. "And your own propiety, family, relationships, peers, collegues, neighbours and the kindred interaction with community and humanity at large, bears you a fairer state."
   <br>&emsp;And the ethics of your own nature left bare, leave you vulnerable to the impressions of the world; the broader definition of which elevates the sharp and bitter tastes, but no less drenches your stiff pallete. 
   <br>&emsp;Where I stand then, is why we need definition, which is to say to freshen our views with timely sense and accuracy, and not propitiate our receptive instrument. And the anwser truly comes down to morals; particularly those with earthy as ooposed to local remarks. For in that, you more than likely would attend, as would you with ease to your family. But man is always growing, and contacting other locales. And our moral quandery lies in the mystery of those amends; whereby the boundries are removed between us.
   <br>&emsp;The point being, that you cannnot be entirely perfect so long as the fortune of others has any sort of concern. The nature of said misfortune, and the appropriate response is one thing; and indeed, defintiion removes the risk of error and at that gratuitous sympathy. But so are we somewhat left hollowed and bare, when we are so uninvolved or committed to those around me. It is perhaps are peak towards modernity that has me looking beyond our local borders; but in all our balancing lies therein the farthest end; whereby we act not like people of old, whose idea of success was the triumph of their own folk, even at the expense of others; but for all of mankind. 
   <br>&emsp;For morals can be split into two camps, namely those which are obligate to fighting, as to achieve the ends of duty through opposition; and those which are boundless, or of all people, and beings at that; by which our opposition is to nature; at least that is the mold for our task. "And indeed, it is much easier to accept, holding all of eachothers hands, her task, whereby we all take her hand; rather than taking some of ours in order to break down others." This may be the better path truly. But of its interest, or aim rather, I am not sure what it is beyond the satiety of its people. And nature surely holds no short supply for us all. 
   <br>&emsp;I'd describe then a 'national' sense of unity, as a head down approach; as if such unity is in arms, and at that against others united. But the spoils of that seem somewhat ignored, in terms of the need for such opposition. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps I have a conceived interest, whereby natures truest task, in terms of our liberty and end, is such that, all people being proportioned towards that, removes any stragglers for goods sought in opposition: namely food and shelter. The issue though, is that the truth of that human matter is not but of inquiry. And so the reproach from a life whose gain is measured without appropriation to what the contents of such pursuit would be if they were respective of the bearing of such inquiry, is one thats uneasy to sell.
</div>
<div id="goodlineage">
   I see with some strenght, that our appeal in life is to goods born of virute; and that such state is born of aversion to impropiety, and a disposition to its opposite; the motivation of which is born from the stability it offers, and the flourishing which steadily and congenially spurrs.
   <br>&emsp;Yet, in all opposition, lies a sort of farce. Not so much of those pressing me; for which my family plays the part. Rather, in our awareness of the truth, shortcomings reveal themselves to others, in that our actions correspond only to what we know; and even in foregin lands, less we abandon relations with such sources, so are we left with a trembling to their expectations: as we have nothing positive. 
   <br>&emsp;Central to this are paternal values. As friendly and or romantic relations are like long summers; lucky to have come, but with no damantion upon winters coming. 
   <br>&emsp;Rather, children situtate themselves as the soul concern; in society, from our mother and father, and at that the judgement of others around, commending and or disputing me for my actions as they proper to such oblige.
   <br>&emsp;To begin, beyond traditin and what other people expect, there is no duty in having children. The government does not request; nor are you censored in rights or oppertunity. You are at best subject to scrutiny, pity or indifferent dissapproval by folks familiar with the matter. "And indeed, modernity has brought with it a decrease in the passions of such contempt; nor has the expectation of such afairs remained a custom."
   <br>&emsp;But, we are all people. And as friendship and romance are to be expected, akin to one's sensible course amidst the comfort of food, so is it fair to expect, or predict rather, that children will be sought, and by that sentiment, had.
   <br>&emsp;This is comparable to a kids eventual interest in a car; and despite not requiring it, so would the value and or interest predicted to come, be tailored with the approval of actions set one for such achievment. Children are no different, in that the foresight of their coming, per an assumed interest, elevates actions as worthy of approval --or not- in succeeding in such action.
   <br>&emsp;For all contention and praise in the matter comes down to the requisites for parenthood; in that you must birth, shelter, feed and raise the kid. And of the needs which one's expereicne, or common sentiment (as inhereted) have shown to be useful and or essential in meeting such matters, so doth wisdom lay. 
   <br>&emsp;For all men generally wish well for another. At least, of the concerns men have, it is usually within the sphere of those which they'd deem kindred. And by that, as tenants for certain tasks are inhereted, so does such guidance get passed along. And so a young man will be prompted by their families guidance, via the assumption they have that he has certain interests, and their experience in what is effective for the matter; the union being one of parent's care for him to succeed, and thus offering him what they can that they esteem useful. 
   <br>&emsp;And indeed, as a young man myself, I find that, misguided or not, that the interests of such sentiment are such that it is rarely of little benefit to at least heed such input. For even if those who care for you are fools, you can at least expect that their intent is good. By that, I submitt myself to their words in order to listen to something worth my time. Which is not how most discourse is occasioned, in that, less I beleive there will be worth, then I afford no attention. Whereas to those who I care for, and at that see as caring for me, I bear such attention without pretense of profit. There may be none, and at that, I continue to see them as I had. But their relation to me bears them a constant welcome to try and suggest something. 
   <br>&emsp;Where lifes friction comes to fight, is not neccessarily when said offerings are of no benefit; rather when said inputs are not given with our own welcome to take them or not. But instead, there is a mixture of indigence at our not accepting what is said. That, and of the ways we are presumed to take otherwise, there is a sentiment of pity and disgrace; as if, what was offered confidently as something good for me, upon not being adhered to, colors me with actions that are then not good; which invites the sense that we are thus not doing well, despite the esteemable offer.
   <br>&emsp;The cause of this entanglement is not one that has much basis in the relation; for in that, there would be one if I bore no attention. But seeing as I do, and the concern is one of accpeting such offer, that the reason I do not, is comparable to the reason that the dissent from the offer bears conflict: namely, that those offering such sense, beleive it to be true. 
   <br>&emsp;And to halt our inquiry, I'll simply say, that as for the lineage of one's belief, and the crossover between folk, be it strangers or relatives, that such matters are set in the means by which knowledge is acquired at all. "And the according relations which exhibit themselves based on such material." But aside from that, lies the matters of our believe. Beyond our disputes with others who see otherwise, there is, by our character and right, a bound of liberty to both enjoy and heed such beliefs, and at that their steps and ends.
   <br>&emsp;In that, lies our core principle, which is that a child is something you attent to, and oblige yourself to its helpless need. Romance is a matter of interest; and despite the loss, both parties continue to be. While the loss of a parent by a child is a damning sentence. For despite their comparble trouble in remaining happy, they also cannot feed themselves. If it were the old times, then their inability to gather food would be a complete sentence. Nor in modernity, where employment is concerned, would their lack of so warrant them any stock of food -or shelter. And so bar none, our regard for a child should be a moral one, rather than a fancy. 
   <br>&emsp;And it being so, is a challenge, as I know not how our own life should be. But, considering morals to be defined along the lines of duty, we can at least be imperfect in out attempt to be responsabile. While the whims guided by fancy seem more like dreams and passion; and albeit fair and pleasurable, are not themselves productive, but rather gains. "In other words, one's regard for children is comparable to all regards, in that their are means and ends. But whereas the failure of a relationship is but a cease of the end, so is a failure of parenting a failure of another's being. And by that, we can say, that easy or not, that the duty to a child is of the highest order; and by all fair accounts, ought not be 'handled' with impairment, nor oversight to things we'd thus be ignorant of." 
   <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst this, is that the measure by which we happily and neccessarily raise our child by, ought be whole and complete; and by that, not garnered by convention or approval, but by the measure. To be clear, this is not to say, that if our principle for rearing is to have our kid be well, that our particular case of something be decided by that; as such a statement is not actionable. Rather, we ought have some sense as to what we need, in terms of home, food, prospects. For the ends of our child will be such, that by their own whims, and furnished in their own manner, that such elements will be what we provide for them while they are being cared for and raised: differing only in the complexion relevant to that age.
   <br>&emsp;To return to my inquiry, I am left questioning the merrits and or need for dental work. That, and the neccessity of optics, nutrition, conduct of living, space, education, commradery and being social; that, and the limitations born of childhood, and how travel and employment ought be prepped for and advanced. For it is hard to say what I need as a parent, when the need of my child is unclear. No one debates the need to feed them, and at that whether or not they be fed; but seeing as 'feeding' could vary in constitution, so is it a principle of mine, and at that a fair assumption, that some constitutions will be better; leaving then the question as to what knoweldge or sense leans something as being better; or better said, as having qualities and or effects which are worth higher degrees of approval. "For it is one thing to say that I will feed my kid well, and to do so by not feeding them pop and donuts. But what about the degrees of benefit, and the various forms which things can take to be deemed such. A general measure is what our general sentiment accords, in that we have a general sense of what is good as to correspond with our interest in offering a general benefit. But if we want something riper than that, then so we'll need an equal kind of sense."
</div>
<div id="equallyaimed">
   What I seek for my child is akin to what I seek from me, liberty. But this aim is only strong as I truly seek it: and per our desire, our ignornace throws us off. For liberty is under attack; namely from public, or at least what is percieved as public, opinion. For in that, my morals are otherwise to my family, relations and explicilty so to my child. Moreover, I have a propiatated sense as to treat others kindly, help them in need, or at least be kindred in what they say. Surrounding this though is worldly sentiment; be it from the town over, the kindgom, our people's land, or the relation of such commune with others. 
   <br>&emsp;Our sensibility here is not without promise, in that our awarness of such breadth may offer us freedom from the pangs of stretched concepts; which is to say, that in seeing the world, in meters or miles, we are somewhat subject to it as a realm of thinking. Even if our pleasures and effort surround what is local and dear to us, so is there a foregin, if not adversial sense far and abound. And we may, upon being subject to such sense/extent, remove the risk for inflammed fears or passion which a lack of understading of such breadth imbides. 
   <br>&emsp;Beyond that though, there is a frustration which rears deep within me. Namely, there are representatives, and some common discourse, which remarks the affairs of such world, be it from sympanthy or our relation to something. But unfortunately, there is a sense of imperative, and at that a glare of those inflammed passions which we are all to weary of. And it is one thing, upon seeing more of reality and experiencing the doubts of it, and removing such pang, and hearing others who seem equally distressed, and at that doubtfull, but have leaned in, and at that overlooked their ignorance. On one hand, there is the matter of our discontent of others being so impassioned; as such cries of distress flurry our own view of things, and at that reveal more ignornance: making it thus hard to feel sensible enough. It is another thing though, that in our response to such 'increase to the point of content', that we'd be critical of those who are the cause of such; and at that, our cynicims spurrs up as a sort of righteousness, as if what was fair enough to know in order to give our realtion with the world some peace, that so, in others not as situated, that their passion then is some sort of flaw. It may be such, but it is our own sensitivity which prods us to define them. This is a difficult sentiment, as the merrit in seeing them as 'unrigthfully impassioned' is not far off; but taht we are put off by it is more a remark of our self, and the amiability we have to any sort of ignorance. "As if we padded all the edges to an obsessive degree; but upon someone knocking at the door, I flinch: and is that a problem with their manners, or me?" 
   <br>&emsp;So it is hard for me to say that liberty is what I seek, for I am somewhat seperate from the lingering fears brought on by other people's expression. Our own sentiment about the world is both large and ironed out. But our place in life is such that our composure is more peacefull than it is of luster; and so we get thrown off easier by those clambering around. "And indeed this may be a choice away from remedying back to a relation with the world which is not so intruded upon, fairly at least; for she herself shows me her harshest sides, or at least points out where I have imagined concepts. But upon seeing the truth and letting it sink in, it is only our inactive place amidst such conception that has me feeling off, when others are more apparent in their sense that the world is otherwise." That is the route of solitude.
   <br>&emsp;For it seems natural and fair, that our place in the world would be approved of and preferred had we run the course entirely, rather than starting half way through our life. And at that, I can say, in all our best subtly, that our child will have that regard from me. To the effect, that their liberty will be as bound as mine, but not so from reproach and fortuity. And by that, their full strides will keep them steady and unaverse to the crowd's singing. That, and their own strides, as remark the stature and care of a man, will have more means and pleasure in furthering the moral bound; whereby they may be more invovled in kingdom, the world even. "While we are just squandering our ability to at peace with our friends and family." 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, I have a clearer picture what to do. For the same question I have right now, is one that perhaps indicates an awnser; namely, because of our concern, so will our child reach a similar point, where they are asking what they ought raise their child to be, and at that, what is a) their oblige, as a mixture of duty and interest, and b) how they can achieve this without negligence or oversight, and at that, succeed with excellence -so what they offer is not merely good, but swell.
   <br>&emsp;First off, as my need for a child is my choice, so will our child be the same. And by that, as we are given suggestions and care by the assumption that we naturally will want to have kids, that so will my child revieve such assumption. "Not that they must have a kid, but that seeing as they will at some point wish to, how can we rear them for such."
   <br>&emsp;But foremost in our sentiments, is one of liberty, as opposed to confinement. For in one, the means we seek are those which relieve our troubles; and generally, this is the basis for all our actions. But where liberty differs, is that in our success we don't merely indulge in the excess of those elements, but rather propitiate ourselves to to others matters. For seeing the sun bears no need, and at that holds no essential care. But it serves as an instance whici liberties merrit and need reflect. Namely, that of those excesses of what we basically need, so do these, in excess, blunt our ability and care to see the richer things of the world. Second though, is that beyond such pleasant sights, that we may a) wish to see further, and at that better --as to see the sun is not much more than the bright ball in the sky; while in truth it holds a deeper complexion; and b) contribute towards such matters, in the postive sense that we respond neccessarily to the prompts imbued by nature within us, to treat our hunger and fear; only in this case, the draw is towards something positive, as if a satiety to our curiisity and wonder, rather than our baser needs. 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, we could summize our nature as being one of need; but properly characterize such need as some range of emphasis within a domain of interests wishing to be ceasesed (or full); the gambit of which covers our hunger, wonder, reverence, lust. And not to get derailed, but liberty -as we ought mention what it is- is really just a measure of baser successes, whereby the sight of wonder is given the time to seek, be drawn, and at that be heard, when the pleas of our hunger are equally fufilled. The point being, that withtout air, the concern of food is gone, and water at that. But soon, upon the satiation from those and warmth, we reach a point where our finer instruments can open up, be prompted, and oblige our draw.
   <br>&emsp;No matter, the important note is that along those lines of excess, there lies a sort of stubborness and discipline; whereby the means to such satiety are deemed adversarial, and at that constantly fleeing away. Even if we have enough, and so much that we have more than enough often, there sits this attitud of 'and you musn't let it go, for it will flee away'. Because of this though, there is this fear to focus on things beyond those baser matters. And the reuslt is that contents of those matters get overly emphasized, to an indulgent effect. "For people find stability, but act with respect to it in terms of smoothing their efforts spent on reaching so, or applying themselves as to reach deeper means of provision." But the matter of satiety is fairly objective. Not so much in your means to seed what is neccessary, but what is neccessary. For some indeed do not have enough for what is needed; and at that, are fair to value finding said means. But if you have such means, and are situated somewhat as to maintain them, then the goods on offer are additional, and at that uneccessary. Better yet, if the means to neccessity are enhanced, then you are sitting with profits, as your expenses are more or less payed. And to be fair, meeting those finer tastes does cost money, or at least benefits from such; but in that case it is unessential. At least in terms of the employment towards such things. And from that, the primary means to food and shelter is money, while our finer tastes are advanced through attention; which is, upon the satiety of those former, given reign to. And so working for more money, either bears more food, which causes an all likely indulgence; or softens your means to attending to those finer interests. Though these benefits are in some cases mere novelty, and at that, born from distractions and or draining committments; which has more of a negative effect on your finer attentions, as your time is spent immoderatley elsewhere. For circumstances do change, in time and localle, but generally speaking our means to neccessity are small. And so long as we are propiated to the sufficeincy of such, then the manner of means is fair. And at that, if the course to such means is all consuming, so be it. But as much as it is not, so is our excess of time free for finer attentions. "We can at least have this sense in mind."
</div>
<div id="cleardeeds">
   To bring this together, our childs life is characterized by our excellent vision of it; whereby the felicitous goods of our finer interests hold the fairer dream. That is our hope at least. And in line with that, so would our child be reared with the sense that they would have a similar interest, and at that the means to foster a similar dream (for their own child).
   <br>&emsp;In this though lies a broad concept, namely of equity. Whereby that sense of furthering our means, and at that the pecuniary goods from them, that so lays the common notion of fortune, and our benefit in nurturing it. I do feel like an obvious weakness of this course is clear, as accruing fortune is not in itself advantageous; as the extraction of the accrued funds for use is needed in order for the benefit to be made. "And it is hard to say when you cut off some of the pie." That, and considering our finer interests, so are the attentions for equity draining in terms of the required maintence and appointment. And as formentioned, our aim is of that dream, whereby our higher interests flourish. And as stated, these benefit only novelly from things beyond our needs. 
   <br>&emsp;As a result, our pecuniary care for ourselves and the family to come, is one which more aptly acheives sufficiency. For it is admittedly a chore to work common jobs; nor do those that offer higher wages and ways leave us with as much rigor as we'd please. In all honesty, our modern sense of this is a litle conflicted; as our current time is indeed privaleged to work from home, and through finer means; which themselves afford higher wages then lower jobs, and are generally more hospitable to our health. Even so, if we were a plumber, so would we be one because we applied ourselve to some better means of providing for ourself. 
   <br>&emsp;In all fairness, the scope of our life is not so easy to state. And from that, there may be but a limited sight, in terms of future decades, which our regards struggle to content. But in general, commnon jobs can leave us robust and provided for; that, and they may be achieved without application. I am merely saying, then beyond one's childhood, that they may infuse their liberty, and privalege of application, to form themselves for preferred means. And at any rate, their broader interests, as remark things of a civil and or professed sort, fall equally under this line. And as to conclude, granting the limited scope of our life's end, that so will baser and or applied means to sufficiency reflect the complexion of our commensurate duties. "Contrasting what they are traditionally, in careers, perk packages and pension." These may hold essential benefits; but each item is to be measured seperated from the nicety of something offering one. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, we can remark the slippery notions of dental, optics, babysitting. Along with the more definite, yet demanding in principle situation, of living arrangments, schooling, and the otherwise commiserability of the expected 'oddities' in this, with the common rungs of the world. The rungs mind you, which hold neccessary elements of infancy, namely in being around other people; along with the likely interests in later friendship, romance, cooperation and esteem. 
   <br>&emsp;Let us start though with that notion of working from home or not. I cannot say how this relates to times of the past; though I give myself some leniancy, in that of the understadning of how our life would go along, by our liberal standard even, that so might those hold more unity via the simplicity of said times; or at least whatever those standards were, so would the nature of work be according to that, and thus not so relevant now. 
   <br>&emsp;I will say though that working from home removes alot of hurdles. For one, it does not impact what our child does, in the way they live; for it is merely a matter of whether we drive to work, complete our shift, then return home, compared to starting our shift at home, being there through our shift for the benefit of pleasure and need, and returning to living all while being at home. There is the question of education and people, but babysitting gets removed primarily as our prescence at home fills the otherwise task. That, and our managment of shifts between my partner and self is simpler, as someone (if not both) will always be at home. And indeed this affords some leaway for a potential partner to work out of home; or myself even if they work from home. 
   <br>&emsp;As regards dental, my feeling is that a great deal of its value comes from remedying what is otherwise a result of ill health. And seeing as health is natural to our dearer interests, and quality of life in general, then so do dental issues reach less prominence. Orthodontics may not be worth regarding; but are cleanings even, which I have not partook in since my younger years, become but situationally required -or of worth. And by that, the regard for them is much further then our cares for routine living, but of some irregular expense. I see optics similarly, and less so even as the presumed cost is likely in the low hundreds, and final at that. While dentistry might hold a higher fee, and regular at that. But of any pretense that it is essential, or advantagous, I'd remark the lack of prescence of it through all but the recent century, and how the manner of health likely causes such concerns, and at that, upon good heealth, alleviates them.
   <br>&emsp;With that in mind, I think it'd be fair to offer a sample outline of our finances. For one, working from home holds no expected difference in pricing. Certain costs of living may be introduced, but the actual means is different. Moreover, there are likely health plans afforded by those at-work scenarios. Though, I must note the general state provision for such. No matter, if I and my partner are equal in income, then 25$ per hour, 20 hours per week, is 4000$ a month. At 30 hours, were at 6000$. 
   I submitt that a car is not needed. Beyond the people our child will associate with, there really is no other need. I can remark the need in emergencies, or in order to meet appointments, but these concerns range in prevalence --considerably moreso during early infancy-- along with preference, as less our child cannot walk, then we can otherwise reach appointments. And there are such things as strollers for all things non emergency. "A doctors visit comes to mind." 
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, what I see, for my life and my partners, is a constance of days which is blossomed through our provisions, into a time full of games, reading, tv and craft; along with local living, and land travels. There is the notion of far off travel, and our childs requisite of walking, speaking, and general sense; but this remark holds with it other matters regarding essential and social need. So no matter, my life, like all others, is local; and mine and my partners life is such, that as adults, we need no car. Nor do we need much more than room for television and sleeping. Floor living is an odd comment, but more or less, a little space for living is fine. Establishing values, we can say that there are indeed preferences, and such as regard sound upon the years of infancy, but in terms of space, only an amount needed for what our lives constitute is required. That, and as much as that is fitting and our life is in motion, so do those preferences loose their luster. Moreso, because our needs are easily met, so can we select places with preferred features, namely location. In that, being nearby a park is a god send, for we, as adults, can walk there, play and read; as can our child go there with us, become healthy, find means for rest and at that interest; and otherwise bear him into stateliness: 'as all adults behave like kids, in their emtion at  least, when their inactive; and so is the risk for our kid (in all his procolviity to do so) less so'.
   <br>&emsp;As a quick note, in terms of savings, as might remark the timely needs of the infant, or the prep required for their presumed need of things, so may we live according to that prep; and in line with our choice to have the kid, so may we act with equal deliberation regarding funds; considering what we need, and taking some time to fufill that. In parallel with that, is the notion of retirement, and how the point in which you can do so, or afford to at least, can be sensed an age prior, and prepped for.
   <br>&emsp;Now, concerning strict funds, the essential matter are those elements of routine living. For all other expenses are unclear, and at that met by our own fortunes and effort. I admitt there may be more, in preference or need; but I also rest on the tenants of simplicity, and how the expectations of others things, however common, relly come because we are undefined in the more basic matters. "And I do consent to taking those matters seriously, as to then afford the leisure of principle and chance." In that, our cost of living as a couple is likely 2000 for rent, or 2500 if more space is needed. Then, you have 800 for food and beverage, and really not much more. In that case, to have shelter and bread, would cost between near 3000, perhaps a bit more. But on those basic grounds, we can afford such working 20 hours a week at 25$ an hour. And as I submitt an honest examination of our needs, I also permitt myself on the basis of the natural increase in wages and time. For the case of our lives is ultimately one of activity; and considering the irrelvance of extra money for such, we'd choose a robust job that pays less yet enough, or work fewer hours rather than more, for the sake of activity. But considering our attempt to have a child, and dreaming even of us both working from home, so could we raise our hours to 30 a week, and at that, go from 4000 to 6000 a month. If our expenses were 4000, which in all honesty, considering 2500 for a basement, and 1500 for food (and no car), so would that extra cash be free for saving. And by that, we could, by our middle class earnings paired with lower class frugality, save 20,000$ in a year. "And who couldn't afford a baby carriage after that." And surely the preperation in terms of tools and some rainy day funds could be made during the pregnancy even. For working at home has that benefit, in that the lesser amount of labor affords those pregnant to work more and later into the semesters.
</div>
<div id="burntremiss">
   Let us begin with ourself.
   <br>&emsp;We are fine, yet somewhat burdened by prior effort. This is normal, yet our response to such ware is where we find trouble.
   <br>&emsp;For in our amends we mean to recover. Yet, in prioritizing such, we are unengaged with other affairs. Personally, there is nothing I lack; yet as regards the ultimate means for family, so are we unadvanced or set. 
   <br>&emsp;Weirdly, our life is best summarized as a fine attempt to be ourself, while giving mere regards to the likely future. We settle ourselves unknowingly, but happily on our principle basis; whereby simplicity, such position in the times, and our otherwise humble needs, fair us no mountainous task. "Will I be able to complete my meager task in 10 years time, I do not know; but I am confident on its simple basis, and our trajectory as dervied from past steps; whereby we can see that we'll naturally improve."
   <br>&emsp;In this though lies our contention. For such a remission from gripping the means to your future is not given much approval, or respect at that. And, as the complexion of our relations with others, so is a scenario where such relations see me as dependant, than so does that whiff of contempt (by said others) make me feel pusehd up against the wall.
   <br>&emsp;I don't beleive this to be the truth assessment; but our feeling is more or less, that our wish to oblige our self, while not being so advanced for the future, and mixed within our scenario of dependance, whereby we have asks and needs from said others who are concerned of such future, leaves me feeling averse, and at that seeking some place without such contention.
   <br>&emsp;But this is not the right statement. For we are fine, and our deeds are realy not so poor in thesmelves, nor so contentious. 
   <br>&emsp;What is really occuring is that we don't know what we want to do. It is not so much that we are clear, but letting the present bloom into the future. Rather, that future is not so defined, and at that, prepped for our gradual possession. Instead, it seems, in all infant garulity, that in our care for rest, and the aversion to others wishing me to focus otherwise, that I in fact seek not so much that gradual advance, and at that permission to be right now, but rather to not advance at all, and simply be: whereby the coarsest of interest comes to parse, namely dreams and gratuity. "For I reach for some concept far ahead, but so rash and lustfull that it only holds bounds within our pondering moment; a point I wish to remain at. Moreover, I yearn for an abandoment for that future, in plans or character, and to otherwise live as though there were no rules at all; so that, be it in gluttony or epicurean ends, so may my current pleasure be the soul amend. All mind you, with a measure of consent or reproach based on such pleasure; the indulgence of which, holds permitt to be, then moderate from. Yet duty holds no right to overstep then retreat: for she is always in need to rightly proceed -rather than stopping, erring, then returing to an idle point of less gratuity."
   <br>&emsp;I might state an unwelcomed remark, namely that  of those around me, who hold so much emphasis of the future, that they do so because there angles and humors are off that stationary being -and the wishes around it. And because life holds no warrant or reward for such effort, so do they learn. "For I know not one grown up who is so able and wise, who wasn't at some point a lustfull teen, or gorging loaf." 
   <br>&emsp;In that it is somewhat easier to see how they learned what they did, and at that believed in; of which we receive. 
   <br>&emsp;But I think in all scenarios, there is a lack of character to begin with; and a remaining abscence upon their 'maturing'. For the point at hand, is that the future is unknown; and despite certain wants and needs, that sensibility and principle can curtail both a satiable and easy satisfaction. Whereas those who age with characters of a contrary sort, are merely forced to move via life's tasks. But they don't suddenly become inbalmed to principled living; merely one which is more appropriate to nature's ways. 
   <br>&emsp;The point to clarify then, is how a state of indolence and gratuity get converted into responsability, and the disposition for it. For the thing I'd note, is that the transition from the former to the latter does not remove the tendancies or cares of the former. Rather, amidst lifes bends, there sits spots in need of oblige. And of such younger wants, so must they be subsisted by such obligations. "As such amends mark the means to be: of which our wants are laid upon." On route of this, one either developes better means to subsist in their younger ways; or such ways become propitated to a life which the obligate ways spurr. For being responsabile does not always excite our younger passions, but rather activites and comforts which are more productive, and at that conformable to the itinerary and effort of our deeds. 
   <br>&emsp;But we musn't flinch from the fair description of what we see. Namely, that as obligations are ahdered to, so does the remaining effort, or time rather, exhibit itself in those younger ways. The colors and hues may alter, or the form rather. But the nature remains; in that you drink one way in the younger state, and in another in the responsible one. "But the orbit of wine remains." In this sense, we could describe someone as a mix of oblige and the character proper to it, and a surrounding medley of in between affairs.

<div id="needofnecessity">
   By my accounts, the merrit of metaphysics is based on the sentiment of 'neccessity', and its relation to being and goodness.
   <br>&emsp;For on one end, there is a basic inquiry as to how things became, in motion and substance, from nothing; and that even if they held a constant existence, that of there peculiar motions --as to create the features we deem objective-- that so is this equally unclear. For one may say that in substance and motion, that such things are asietic, or constant rather. There still lies though the issue of composites, or the evident objects we see. "Even if all was but a sliver off in terms of trajectory, so would uniformity be absent." And at that, considering reality as a whole, the question lies in the concession that its material and impetus is innate and constant; yet the orientation of each strand is not so clear; or in other words, 'if we take it to be true that there are forms which remark a lack of isotropy, then how does this inherently occur'. For you come to the question of parts and wholes. Considering that all is but a mixture of slight differences, how do such differences occur? The common notion is that, akin to the fabric of a sheet, that so may it ripple here and there, while remaining whole. The mystery though, is what causes any such ripples? There is no evidence that what we take to be objects are but compositions of the slightest ripples. Yet, of such small ripples, why would they compound into the complexities we see today, or in the infant stage of existence, if said ripples were not oriented differently. "For if they were in fact equal in their orientation, wouldn't the result, however extensive due to there being motion at all, be one that was uniform? And thus, how are such strands oriented differently than others, if not for their own uniqueness compared to them. But as so, what springs each piece to be a certain way? Or better yet, less there be some guided emphasis, why would each piece, in its being and end, differ from any other?"
   <br>&emsp;There is something taken for granted in all of this though, and it primarily falls into the thinking that our portion of the supposed 'force', or spirit, which guides all into being, is in fact something for us to reunite with upon our cease of objective being. "As if the food on the plate was done, and all that was left was the platter: the baseness of which, is viewed as something to desire, in that of our deepest end, to be souly with such (baseness), means we have won." And this indeed leads to the sentiment that 'our objective body' as guided by the plate, weighs it down; and thus, upon such release from said body, that the portion of nature's plate is all thats left, 'leaving us pure'.
   <br>&emsp;Science, and indeed sceptical inquiry, 'or a method of advancement rather than angsty conclusion', means to demonstrate that the basis for such notions is unfounded, and at that, truly discover more about nature; and by that, our relation to it. The method of this is one thing, and indeed it differs than the scholastic or abstract. But foremost in the trail of promiscuties (produced by the latter) is the abbrasive notion that without the prescence of a nature which remarks the tenants of such, that the world is otherwise evil. "For how am I suppose to be pure, and at that emablmed with the fairest of things." 
   <br>&emsp;My response is almost impossible, as it ultimatley leans on the strength of our beliefs in the contraries of neccessity. For in that, I say, that the denial of metaphysics is not merely a reorienting  of one's place within it; namely, that per the norm, that in that deeper realm (upon death) we return to, our rebuke of metaphysics does not claim that this 'salvation' is merely denied, but rather the concept of such realm entirely. And the promiscuity in this, is that most folk have little idea of how things move in a 'unneccessary way', that so do they have little concpetion of the 'unneccesary way' of death. And so when I say, that not only is there no realm for your soul, but not a soul entirely, you are left with the mystery of true death. But such an idea ought not frighten us at all. For even if it did, it would be in all likelihood the apprhension of what sent you there, namely things which constitute threats. But the irony is that most folk who have a handle on the soul-realm concept, hold a sort of ambivolence to such threats: 'for they throw me not into a place I'm afraid of; and at that, offer but a different means to the same end: an end which I am all to happy to reach. And the route to such point, in terms of what happens to me (as our own choices do stear us a litte), is generally irrelevant: so do as you please'. And all the while the fear from living stirrs them not, as the consquences are somewhat muted, so are we distraught without such ends in mind; whereby we succumb to the fear of danger, and at that the contention of there being no sturdying end. Yet there is such a place; one which compares to the peace found in rest, or the tranquility in deep sleeping. "A state which, like those, is equally dark, void of dreams or discomfort, nor distaste for the lack of comfort; for like those who feel held by the body, so is such an experience (of deep sleep) one which exhibits the qualities found when one is seperate from the body: death being a mirror of that, but constant."
   <br>&emsp;In that, the truth otherwise considering the illusion of a dual realm and soul, is unknown. But as I know not the truth in the earth's orbit, or the composition of matter, so am I aware of their complexions, and at that character. And as features of a mystery I do not know, so am I content in the qualities of such feature; in the same way that I am all to pleased to not be without air. And by that, beyond our faith in discovery, and at that understanding through inquiry, of the term good, and its contrary of evil, 'I accept the sentence of death in all it's nativety'; the peace of which, makes the truth unremarkable. "For my life, like those subject to danger, yet with ambivolence upon their end's security, is all too gracefull in the meagerest of fortune; in that such a state is colored by an abscence of danger; which upon the removal of beasts and famine, holds little attention by me.

<div id="grippingourmeasure">
   So a contract is a fair point of security. As are dealings towards one but prospective, but not yet securing.
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, I must state that my views of peoples aims in life, and at that methods to reach them, is ill thought, antiquated, and at that contrary to the purer things worth seeking. But as we are not so imbued by the choices of others, so do I feel like I have to prove our own merrit within the path we take. The problem though comes down to aims; for we are not merely reaching for the same thing but through a different method; nor do we have some way of living which is proposed to reach the points sought by other methods.
   <br>&emsp;Where the notion of contract comes in, is that I see, in our own way of being, that of our confidence in it, that so is it fair as much as we have a contract; which is to say that we are secure in our place -wherever that may be.
   <br>&emsp;For I ultimately feel like we are asked to be something, and at that define ourselves and reach such end. For if we are otherwise, then we are but exploring, inquiring, seeing things as we gradually be; but such a pace is not so respected; and foremost is it tricky to share. For less I communicate why we are not grasping for common ends, or one of our own, then we are left with a sort of shaded development; one which hankers little over the future and its outcome, but merely blossoms as it be's right now. "But it is oh so hard to convene yourself amidst elders, or those inbued to their ways, when to an end you are not endowed."
   <br>&emsp;Our ultimate concern is not one which remarks a soul, but rather a united state of nature in which our forms are merely part of. And to that, our familie's along with our own ends, are in finality such. "So I dredd any reality wherehy the gluttonies of pain are shrewd upon them, or even those primitavley moral and or natural fair; but that they'd be thrown to such ends, is not but assuring; for such finality (in access or complexion) differs not by any entry." 
   <br>&emsp;But so in life ought we work to be pleased; for we need to in many ways, 'less our stomach forever grumbles'. But beyond the natural futility of this, 'seeing as the ends are the same', so can we respect the fact that we are alive, and at that with cognizance of such ends, but all the while we live. In that sense, our idea of the end is but a kind of idea, as would compare to other kinds --of the present or future. And so from that, we can rightfully amend to the cares of our living, and at that settle on that ultimate fact as if it were but a further kind of regard, as compared to those more pressing. "For our fear of death, or address of it at least, is for the sake of fortifying ourself against nearer concerns; as a final sense angles the meaning of everything as to be accordingly set and kept." The crucial sentiment though, is that although all that we do is in peace or attempt for such end, that seeing as such an end holds no 'requisite' to it's entry, but rather a mere understanding as to know its ultimate offer is freely had, that so in our security and rest upon such understanding, can we do as we presently please. 
   <br>&emsp;With that in mind, might we be a little principled in this, and as all past men have, concern ourselves with the aim of our living. 
   <br>&emsp;To be clear, that living and the aim within it hold a warrant for us to address, so has that been stated. "And favorably so, for most of a man's regards are so as to remove unseen or predicted threats (and consqeunces), as to then earn the ease of living as his more 'pleasingly tuned senses' care for." Culture thus is a primary tailoring of such 'unpleasant regards'; whereby the experiences of one's negligence and or ignorance in the world bears them an insight and or lesson to learn, and then share: culture being the sum of attitudes and principles which collaesque said experiences, and faciliate them into societal norms and custom. 
   <br>&emsp;My feeling though, and where I stand, is that as one grievence is dealt with, in food let's say, and another subsquently --upon our attention and care opening up- that so is our final concer of death, and the mystery of being an ending point whereby our fears are dispersed --which the soul, or 'other realm' is neccessitated as the fair attribution. By that, the whims of us which are not endowed and or 'naturally' disposed to aversion and risk have warrant and ease to flair, and in that blossom towards the grades of the world which postively attract us. "The point being that such relations are proportionally stirred, as the whims which brace towards things which appear negative, and at that spurr apprhension, cease." 
   <br>&emsp;Bringing it all together then, the world is a certain way, but considering it as food and platter is flawed. And per older ways, the soul is not a present concept. No matter, the fairer view of death, or one in unity, is such that the experience is A) preferable, as one feels in the deepest of rest, and B) reached by the ceasing of one's form; which exhibits them as not being dead; and as such, occurs by any means which such form ceases. With this being so, our place within such form, whereby the experience of living is at hand, so may we concern ourseles with worries and threats nearer than our final end. "As such an end is not something we must prepare for, but merely accept so much as we care to know, and are insecure without. But in knowing how it is effortlessly reached, and at that not so unfavorable upon entry, so may it, as a mere kind of concern within the domain of all worries, be set aside happily: like our hunger had been satiated, and thus there was no attention brought to mention: all the while mind you, other pangs worth mentioning (by memory or throbbig) can be addressed: and at that naturally orient you as so." 
   <br>&emsp;And by that remark, one may say that pleasure is a servant to pain, 'for no amount of what pleases us could subsit for the oitment to our grasp for air'. And by that, only such a treatment is of concern, and as such a neccessity. But considering that such requirment is met, then so are we free to pleasantly be. "For I am indeed pleased with the air around me; yet this is not effectivley so when it is absent; for I am not then lacing what pleases me, but what I need. In the same way without heat I am desparetly in need; while having enough gives mention to the amount which is of excess, and at that pleasing." 
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, seeing as pain is brought on by a thwarting our needs, then so is an abscence of such need a remark of our natural expression of what pleases us. In that sense, stability is the means to such pleasure; while the weakness of the former bears no fair or effective strenght to the latter.

<div id="goodscenery">
   So much in life do I think, but in an unclear haze. And although the contents are desirable, so do they lug me down due to that haze; as their permeability gets blurred, and thus I stirr to keep them defined.
   <br>&emsp;In that, I might benefit in stating some terms, then elaborating on them. First, is pleasure, which is not in its own right good, but rather an objective remark; or a description rather, per our common ways, as is the case for the appearence of red, or warmth of a fire. In the same light as a stars motion as seen through observation, yet not known entirely but the mystery of motion in itself, so do such 'descriped', if not experienced remarks, account for all things beyond that mysterious realm; pleasure and pain of which, are but a memebr of such domain. And in that sense, 'the good and bad', in a purely rational sense, sit in those shaded depths --where the sentiments of motion, substance and being lie.
   <br>&emsp;In this sense, the ethics of our time are inconclusive. Or to quote Russel, 'laudible or not, of all theories which pruport a scale for right and wrong, none ought be reaosnably accepted'.
   <br>&emsp;And so in that way, all we have is a presumed, if not misguided attempt towards the real good; and the all to likely prejudice of what we feel to pleasurable, or at least preffered (as found in experience), as a leaning factor towards what the utlimate good either is, or would correspond too, in the sense that of the pleasure we normally experience, and that such an experience is more or less deemed good, than so would the real one serve but a compartively higher amount. 
   <br>&emsp;And like many things, the Humean notion comes to mind, in that of any idea or sense of what the good would be, we are really referring to what we already experience as good, or consider to be; but in that there lies only what is personally positive; and the good seems but a source of something which would offer but a richer form of what we've already experienced. This assumption though, is built on the fact, that of the good, we presume it to be postive upon being with it; and as such, what we've already experienced as positive is but an instance of some other good, differing only in the form of it. And the highest good, or true one which ethics is concerned with, is but the fairest form to acquaint with. The point though, is that what we imagine such a relation to be, and at that worth in doing so, is in the experiences we've already had which build in prejudices of what the true good would bring, and at that be.
   <br>&emsp;For it is hard to say what the good is outside of your common experience. For it is said that the soul binds to our body, and at that releases upon death; and from there finds a the supposed good. "As if being released from the world back into the fairest meadow." This notion though, in its oldness, seems all to promising, and built as such (in the terms) to mould such promise. Besides that, sits a sort of neccessary moulding, as if a lack of knowledge of the good, and thus resolve to it, will lead to evil; or negative experiences rather. Again, this seems to fall prey to the prejudice of what we presume to bad, and thus the motivations for finding the truth and adhering to it bear themselves from the aversions within our experience. Morevover, if we look at things frankly, then the prescence of a soul, and at that other-realm whereby our own portion of such is set for, is not a theory worth accepting. Foremost, is that the basis for it comes from the supposed neccessity of there being so. But per the being of things, so is this but an absent thought as regards the worlds complexion; in that of the phenomena we see, that it is our ignorance to other worldly elements causing such mystery that has us believing something arbitray caused them. Moreover, if we look at the question deeply, we will see, less we have faith in the ways of such arbitrary force, or at least faith in the conduct of it, all the while we understand little of such conduct, that the question left to us is equal to the sensible mystery of the 'piece like' components of the baser world. For no matter our ignornace there, there is almost surely a lingering question of cause, and at that impetus; the origin of substance too. When we lean on neccessity though, we are really permitting ourselves to conclude based on an explantion which we believe is there neccessarily; yet we have no understanding of the ways in which such 'neccessity' occurs. And even if we attribute good intention of it, we merely have faith and not knowledge. 
   <br>&emsp;This creates a permiscious scenario. For the argument may be that knowledge is the mighteous of interests, and faith is but an appeal to what we have no basis to be true, yet believe in by the intention we attribute to such mystery. The contrary of this holds no reign, despite our uncertainty of knowledge. For that attribution of intent is itself born from knowledge; at least, how can you truly say that the neccessity which faciliates the world has you in mind, or if so, is benevolent? And one may say, 'well, that is fair, but having no truth means that we won't know what to do at all; and tradition does indeed fortell the meaness of human nature, and the then required discipline; the conduct of which, is born from the moral refinement that comes from some scale for approval: in which we form ourselves against.' And to this I say sure, that is itself fair. But we musn't make the common mistake of thinking that our fears of uncertainty, or incomplete morality --in truth or givens- is worth anything more than what we commonly deem as unfavorable, and at that worth 'being good' to avoid. In this way, we are left to the givens of reflection and deliberation, and the all to wordly prominence of pleasure and pain; and by which means or another, that so do we give ourselves a natural placement as to be as we naturally are, in terms of such experiences. 
   <br>&emsp;What I mean then to say, is that if we are to marshal ourselves based on experience, then we ought not pretend like the motivations we have are born from anything other. For we do not know if the sentiment of defintiion is fair, or if it is but a linguistic behavor, and at that feature of our nature. In any case, if we mean to live by givens and principle, then we are effectively giving into prejudice, and at that experience; the procedure of which ought exhibit itself through the propieties of evidence and inquiry. "Where we merely account for, then ask; chartering whats been, and where the meaning may be." 
</div>
<div id="senseandcause">
   All comes down to being. For I might say that our response to things is featured in our use of language; as is our structural composure a response to gravity; or our use of pens and tools, which are features of our dexterity. 
   <br>&emsp;But in this, lies a sort of trouble, in that how we are is baked into the question as to how anything is at all. For the modern notion is that all, or all of us, is but a part of nature's form, and of our portion, 'so are we a strand'. 
   <br>&emsp;On one end, you have the remark of the earth's orbit, and the insight that the mass of the sun draws it to do so; compared to a heavy object in the center of a sheet, and how it moulds the plane as for surrounding things to fall inwards ---or orbit if they have their own initial vecolity, as to create centrigul motion. In this case, what was a blatant observation of the earth orbiting the sun, as the moon orbiting the earth, so was this not itself the point in which the depths of reality lay: beyond that is. Rather, it was as if a deck of cards formed into a tower, and of such form that was all you saw. But upon inspection, you saw the cards, and at that the actual elements in question. But as for their own basis, so would that be closer to any supposed 'depths'; compared to the higher form at least. 
   <br>&emsp;In terms of knowledge then, we have what is apparnet, and at that regarded. But deeper as we go, so do things which appear phenomal have some objective reason. And indeed, the faith in reason is such, that no matter how deep you go, or better yet, considering the depths to which we've been, we still hold faith that a) more light will be shown, and b) that any mystery per the level we've reached, holds a rational explanation below.
   <br>&emsp;In this way, our knowledge can be expressed by sentiments which are observed and understood, and those which hold either a faith as to their rational cause, or one of an arbitraty sort --which we presume neccessary. 
   <br>&emsp;Considering that, our model of life is such, that the phenomena of language and sensation are but nestled in the rocky alcoves of objectivity. And like all chemical elements, which serve as the deeper reasons for higher forms, yet hold themselves a rational source in particles and forces, that so are the subjects of language and mind elements of an equal sort; only, like all dinosaurs that were, and of the fossils which remain, so are the discoveries of mentality but remains of something not yet uncovered; yet with faith, we believe they are there; and at that, our model states that such things are not but ill-observed elements within the higher world. Their pecularitiy, and at that need to be further observed, does remark the mysteries of the deepest of things. For the nature of iron is not much more than the nature of charges and forces particularly arranged. Yet, while iron is quite understood, as an object and with cause, so is the deeper mystery of its cause more easily set, 'for we are clear what the mystery's towards'. While the mind is not rightly presumed to be a part of the world in a distinct way compared to all other things; but in its own way, we hold smaller definitions and much ambiguity. And considering then that for nearly all things the deepest basis is unknown, then so is the link between that and the unclear effect of 'mind', a hotspot for ill-concieved imagination. "For we tend to define that deeper cause in order to anwser the pecularity of the consquent object of the mind; yet the ill-clarity of the latter awkwardly motivates the cause of it to be a certain way; for we both have too little guidelines to propose such cause, and at that, a awry bias in our want to understanding such mindfull effect, to the ends that we make the cause of it in such a way that what we suppose and or preusme the mind to be, as then caused by the manner of something which we deem neccessary to produce what we assume as such. Yet within the mystery irony lay."
   <br>&emsp;At this point, it is only fair to resort to inquiry. And as one in the past may have resorted to faith in the esteemed causes which they held as being with intent for them, that so may we, in the denial of that, and otherwise ignorance of any pre-concieved form or being, that so our faith lies in the frontiers where reason lay.
   <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst these rules, is that in attributing the cause of something apparent with the properties deemed essential, you are still subjecting your understanding of such to the measures which knowledge is found on; and accordingly, if your understanding is ill-placed and guided, then of the truth you do not know. "It is as if a ball was in motion, and your prompted as to whether it came to be so by means of its identity, or another's. And in attributing the latter to something beyond, you really are placing it as nothing more than a prior dominoe; with properties of an esteemed kind mind you, but of properties no less." Asserting then that such properties are present because the effect which they are esteemed to cause could not be so otherwise, is a proof that holds little resistance to all but the faintess wind. 
   <br>&emsp;Indeed though, certifying this as the base of our inquiry is in itself essential. Namely, why the properties of a cause, as relate to its effect, cannot, nor would not be so if in fact, as stated, 'were neccessary, for the effect could not otherwise be'? How is this not true then? Is the attribution wrong, in terms of what is deemed to be required for the effect, and thus the cause? Or perhaps the cause is credited with an end which is itself misunderstood. As if we saw red, but were decieved from the truth in it being a different color. For indeed this is where metaphysics lies, in that weaving of cause and effect. In all fairness, the latter is quite easy to isolate, and formulate as something false in the end attributed to the cause. Yet, even with accuracy to the effect, there still lies something essential. And one's faith in reason is akin to the belief that a discovery will be made. While the belief that the cause produced said effect due to something neccessary, is all but the toughest claims to refute. For I do not know any reason for the effect; and at that, denying the property lauded as the cause, or amidst the being of said clause, is without much validity beyond the speculative prejudice I have; in terms of explaning something by an irrevent factor distinct from the effect itself, but something imposing upon it instead. "While it is not much more than hydrogen and oxygen being that corresponds with their binding into H20. Yet the force of their meeting is the question. Only then though, are we left with the prescence and slight differentation of the field which exhibits the basic particles and forces. And I find little meaning in the neccessity banked on as the explanation of that."
</div>
<div id="truthorinquiry">
   Of ends, so may we falsify attribued means on the basis that the effect of such cause is in itself ill-founded. "So and so is the source for this thing happening; but if that thing is in fact not happening, in dynamics or substance, then so is the proported clause false. At least, that gravity causes the earth to orbit the sun is true, but that it causes our heartbeat (its rythyn at least) is not a reason which falsifies gravity, less it is proposed as the source for so."
   <br>&emsp;Propositions then are a tricky statement, for falsity and truth therein lie. Yet description falls a little short of what they offer, in that their aim is one of explanation, while the other is merely observation. No matter, if I say that iron is but a meddley of particle, so is this true; while saying that quarks are a meddley of particles is not; but this holds no bearing to either of the subjects, rather the quality of their stated relation. 
   <br>&emsp;In this way, one's faith in reason is really one or refutation towards the claim that in being or substance, that so the basis for thing lays. For I may say that atoms are soul, and at that born from the qualities neccessary to proport them. But in doubt, and upon findings, I may deny that, and use such evidence or reasoning to support my falsified claim. 
   <br>&emsp;Where we lie then, is how even the deepest of understandings will be either a) born of reason rather than neccessity, and of such matter known, or b) how in our doubts and or thinking as to the further depths where reason lie, how we know that, at the very least, nothing other will do, whether we have any glimmer of hope, or merely have faith in so; and as such, rest on our uncertainty and inquiry, encouraged by faith and at that the revelations through progress, all the while we care little for, and at that seek to deny, the sentiments which exclaim some non-rational basis for things: as if reason, or its promsing depths, hold nothing more but what neccessity is required to grow. 
   <br>&emsp;That is our trouble. Not the strenghts of our inquiry, and at that encouragment of the gains so far; but whether it is futile to look deeper or explore, but instead accept the infalluable fact that the features we seek explanation's for, are so from something not discoverable; or in other words real, but rather transcendetally moulded and guided. 
</div>
<div id="stainedcloth">
   In this way, the canvas of reality is painted two fold: of completeness, be it of the real we suppose real or not, but entirely so, or of distinction, or otherly rather realms: transendance if you will, whereby that existent realm is cushioned by some resonant other; and of such other, so is it the source for substance and being, i.e properties of mass and magnitude. While the soul realm, or one which, akin to pantheism, is entire, is not one that sees its elements as imposed upon, but rather with immanence. 
   <br>&emsp;For each there is a difficulty; though one seems less laudible. In the dual realm, there lies the mystery of how the other-realm functions, and at that, of its own nature as the guiding force for the real realm. While the complete realm, holds the weakness of ostentation, whereby we ad finitum reach the defintivie quandery of space, form and differentiation. In this case, we can say, that the speculative theory of entirey, is such, that of the complexity we see, so is it sourced from an aggregation of the meagerest differences; the apparent effect being but a compounding of the real entities, and their slightly slivered differences sewing together. 
   <br>&emsp;In some sense, the dual real theory is perhaps the most skeptical. For it does not propose how such other-realm faciliates the features of extistence we see. Instead, it is generally deemed by neccessity that the means to such existence are caused by properties which are not themselves real or explanable, but merely required for anything to be at all. For our point was that the nature of such other-realm was not itself understood. But we are then attributing characteristics to it which we find in existence. "As if there were motions in the other-realm which spurred the motions in the existant realm." But this is not the actual claim of the theory. Rather, it states, that unlike existence, which ebbs and flows in certain ways, that the other-realm, or neccessary cause, is not itself real, and at that subject to any understanding as we'd find in the effect it produces. Personally, this is the frankest statement of, 'it is what it is'; which to me, as a ultimate theory, is quite skeptical. Though, in all fairness, the nature of such theory is such, that it does not support any inquiry into the conduct of its cause; but rather accpets them --with right statement-- as required for the explantion we seek to be claimed.
   <br>&emsp;The main issue though, is where do the neccessary, or otherly qualities and the existant ones begin. For we may say that being is innate, and at that, the effect of motion is born from some unqualified force. And we may accept this as true. Yet, understanding how such a force produces the motions we see is mightliy unclear. At that, we can rightly falsify any 'neccessary' statement on the basis that the effect in question is not fairly stated. Which itself, holds a reccessive issue, in that, as effects appear in their composite form, that so is their actual form an unknown point in which said neccessary causes would unfold. And in that sense, it is quite hard to say what any neccessary cause is, when the proported effect of it is unknown. "For how can something be attributed a cause, when there is no clear effect for it to be a source of. How can we state something as being the means, when there is no (fairly stated) end for it to be reckoned as spurring. For it would seem that of such end, that so is it so, and as such reasonably deemed, by a cause which is in such  a way as to create such end. Yet, of such way, how can we rightly say what it is, when the ends which said ways are reckoned to be so as to create such end, are not themselves known." 
   <br>&emsp;To me then, the weakness of an imposed theory, is that it does not question the composite nature which we mean to explain; moreover, it cannot say what the true elements are, in the early 21st century at least. And that, so much as this weakness holds, 'whereby it affirms a cause to an end with no further basis', than so are you left with a never ending point of real-explanation. For less we rightly and or wrongly affirm the identity of something, and thus subject it completely as the thing for which a cause is proported to make, then so is it fairer to expect that our perpetous discovery of the identity of things will illustrate the explanation which we affored to those 'neccessary causes'. In that case, ought the soul question of our inquiry be, 'at what point do we affirm; at what point does our curisoity feel satiated by the things we really know?' For death, mind, space and magnitude may be understood in the way that we've learned about light, mechanics, organics and such. To which we have one question to ask: is there any more worth to our inquiry? For if every person were adbundantly pleased, and absent of pain, nor were there any doubts of the entrence and or quality of our tranistions within existence, and at that any such doubt as to the conduct of existence as it pertains to our relations with the world, and that such relations were based on findings which held forward and true by the constance of said nature, and at that the lack of suspension and or intrusion, then so might we merely settle some finer despairs, namely in the realm of language, and the other features of the mysterious sides of existence; all the while though, we held no trouble at all but accepting our peace and liberty through life and the stream of infinity. "For at that point, as man, for pleasure, and in the richest of states, are we charged with being as we are liberty to see fit; and by that, forgo, and at that shed, off those behaviros and concerns of primitive disposition."

   So I am here, in Pitt meadows. And I'd like to remark a certain bit of closure; namely of the relevance of other people's thoughts, and our otherwise begrudgement about not being invovled with the things they are so flippant about. In that, we normally feel like the advice, and our wisdom and fair guidance, say to mind your own buisness; attend to it at least. But in doing so, we tend to feel like we are ignoring the buisness of others; which I can only say, in our simplicity, does not hold any fear in me; but there is indeed the hurt you sense in others. And at that, I feel conflicted in disposing our time and attention to our own efforts, all while 'the apparent distress' of others is left for someone else to tend. 
   <br>&emsp;The point however, is that despite this feeling, so is right that our idea of this would be well-founded, and that we wouldn't let imagery, rhetoric, quick conlcusions form our idea of things; and at that, so would individual circusmtances be but random occurences; while remarking upon the world could only be done so with a broader sense and statistics. And upon that view, so are the ruffledness of others response to near sighted views, encourage me to think of the greater good. But so as remarks our irreverence to the seamingly odd occurences, yet amidst a world I am either ignorant of, or with the sense that it is normal, and at that not so pointed towards another's suffering, that so in this approach, are we left with the right mindest. Yet, we feel that others remarks about it are so caved in, and at that full of irratable confusion. Only, what I see is that despitre there being this way, and in such a way as remarks passing conversation, or that at a dinner party (so to speak), that so is it assuring that such moments of seemingly 'in tune' disccsion, despite the empty custom and falir of it all, is all but a moment whereby people's social strides combine with their ignornace, and they say 'trump', or 'get this'; but so do they move on, to occupation, seperate converstions, or relevant interests to their day. And by that, I am not upset to be outside such discussion, and begrieve at that consquences of such flaunty conversation. Nor, do I fear taht such converse leads to irriatbale reactions; as if people would then contribtue towards a the problem they think has occured, and at that be rebellious, dissarayed, anarachic, and brutal. "There is not much of that outswide the despots of Cairo or Sudan."
   <br>&emsp;There will be more developments upon that sure; but what I can say, is that of the fairer view of the world I see, and at that the reproach towards such view, whereby our judgement is suspended, I think I can appropriately be as a single man within the extent of the world; and at that, consider our place within such extent, all the while we are begrieved not, or nor affraid, of flippant and or passive remarks regarding faintly viewed things.
   <br>&emsp;In that way, I have little to comment on in terms of proper custom. What I can say, is that we are here, in Pitt Meadows, lauding the bounty of fruit. And beyond our rustling harmony of concerns I ought to approve, so are we left with the normal course of our life. I can say that health is a prioirity, and besides our moral remarks and enlightenment reading, so is there little but our woodland ventures and homely actions. These are all nice and plenty; though I am somewhat unsure of things in the near term, and so paying 50$ for a short campagin, additional map area, and new game mode, seems a little rich consdiering the means we have. I am not sure if I am overly excited to merely try the base mechanics. 
</div>
<div id="dutiedexpress">
   Might I iron out a loose thread in my mind, namely that of variable forms of discussion; be it promotional, organized, civil, or more along the lines of scoffing and barking, or being talkative and social. 
   <br>&emsp;None truly bother me. For the latter kinds do not lead heavily into the effects aimed at by the former. It is true that such aims are in relation to our representative interests, and at that the right by said interested to democratically convene. But in the case of talk and scoff, so is this quite seperate from the choices eventually made; and at that, any reall contribution to the matter: be it positive or of revolt.
   <br>&emsp;In terms of those organizes and deeply expressive, so are these doing what is fair and appropriate within a state of affairs which faciliates itself on public consent. Whether or not that public is really influenced by said expressions one thing; and that, so much as they are, if it is towards revolt or educated consent, so lies a mystery. "For I remark the recent sentiment of class and orientation equality, and the general scoffing of folks who see such statements as 'over the top'. What I see in fact, is not that in the common walk of theres or any ones lives, that such expressions remark an actual change; beside the barest and most deeply packed policies; but instead, there thrown off by the notion due to ignorance, and how such ignorance thwarts their sense of normacy and security: the consquence being one of hidden fears that they are being supressed, and at that, upset by an equaly deep sympathy for someone other who they feel is being oppressed."
</div>
<div id="theeveryday">
   So it is all to concerning when a person draws their view of the world by the incidents they see. For presumably, there sentiment is one that remarks a supposed world as to produce such incident. 
   <br>&emsp;I would illustrate things this way. There is a light source, and it shines in all directions. Then, there is debris, scattered if you will surrounding it --a spherical orbit. As the line shines, it catches such partciles and creates a sort of figure; of which we are impressed. 
   <br>&emsp;By my accounts, the government, or culture at least which is mixed in, speaks to the light; while the surrounding material in which it shines marks the actual tenants of the world, in people namely. And so if some incident is seen, there is generally two responses: 'man, people are crazy', or, 'damn, those people (of a country or place) are messed up': that, or it is 'why does the government allow this? Like did you see what some guy did: the states is nuts'. Of that  latter, it might be better to state it as a sort of confused irriation, as to how either a people or state can permitt such things, and at that, not remedy them in some supposedly proper way.
   <br>&emsp;The main point I would make, is that not only is the light source as less than prominent cause of those impressions we, compared to the elements shined upon, but that even so, if such light was what caused such a figure to occur, that so would this not speak to the other elements being shined upon. For in that, the glimmers of oddity and despair speak out in ways that both eagerly and crookedly catch our eye. Yet it is perhaps a fair definition of ignorance to say, that being unware of how the less than striking forms appear, and at that, having no solid basis as to ground your impression of something odd, speaks to something worth our concern, in terms of someone exhibiting such ignorance and rashness.
   <br>&emsp;In our own way then, an ignorance as to how people are in general, and at that groups of them, in general or specifically, makes room for our own irrations upon hearing someone else be so rash; as we attribute their feeling to be one of commen sentiment, which is an alarming feeling, in that you perceive the common folk as then being rash. Yet, I  find it important, that even if we suspend or own judgements, and are not elated by incidents, that so is someones contary response but an incident itself, and at that, not often an incident which holds huge amounts of weight. "For someone who is rash and negative, and at that flippantly topical,  but an instigator to other people's shared proclivites; but as such, is not an expressor of something many people care for or respect; and thus, doing so yourself is seldom rewarded; and of such aversion, so may others get sucked into to being equally unappealing. But akin to a mob, which supports others who get invovled in their fury, that upon the mobs cease, so are you left out in amidst the prefferred customs; to which you stand alone as you remain rash, or you then revert back to the acceptable ways."

<div id="sourceforprinciple">
   What ought a man ought to do? I cannot say I know. As regards felicitous pleasure, and peacefull absence of pain, of that I know quite much. But that such a principle would be invoked, seems but a personal pursuit; and at that, not what others exhibit around.
   <br>&emsp;Oddly though, it is not so easy to describe their efforts as anything but. Only, it seems what is regarded as worthy of concern, and otherwise worth seeking, is varied from mine. In that, the notion of utility and pleasure is quite universal in its appeal. And only the apolagists or endowed saints (and their disciples) have much character or need for qualities which pertain to something beyond life. They are not unwise on the whole of it though; for their efforts keep their pleasures moderate yet fair, and their pains at a minimum; nor are their duties dealt with in toil. 
   <br>&emsp;In that way, the principle one uses is always the mighty question. For in the advancment of whichever point we choose, so are we fair to accept the knowledge we have, and merely make do with it while we further learn. At that, assessing things in terms of a principle is as easy as such a thing is understood. "For the sweetness of soda will offer such and such; but of one of those offerings, in the glycemic load namely, in terms of utility contrariety lays." 
   <br>&emsp;Indeed, it would be proper to better define such principle. For if the mere sentiment of pleasure is whats regarded, then such sweetness of soda may remark a higher good than that of an orange. But if the scale for measurment includes in it qualities such as accessibility and consistency, the latter being a mark of what the good from health can afford, then the effect of soda despite its sweetness does not align. 
   <br>&emsp;What I find tricky though, is that in deciding on the principle of utility, or that of idoltry, so there lays a deeper mystery than the mere alignment of comprable things; but rather the actual discovery of what a) the complexion of such principle should be, and b) what the core of the principle is based on; or in other words, what merrits deciding one principle over the other. For that latter mark strikes me as something quite overlooked when it comes to orienting our morals and interests. And the likley reason, is that of whats required to learn about a principle, and at that what bears promsie to a principle of any sort, that in such needed discovery to establish such basic things, that by legacy and it's continued propogation, so do the contents relevant to such discovery already appear to be stated. Just as one may say, that in utility, that accesibilit ought be a concern. For the pleasure of a donut may be fine, but not if you must hike a mountain to recieve it. While the pleasure of a deep breathe, and the creative strides that merrily come, holds a sort of good that is born within, and from there simply. This is all part of the discourse as pertains to objects and their relation to value. But as the alignment of such things is but a matter of understanding them, that so in the acceptence of the principle by which such things ought merely be appropriated to, that our establishment of said principles are comparably based; in that, of certain truths and or insights about the world, whereby the apparent nature of things spurrs the principle we have, so is such knowledge which principles are derived from not full or founded. And at that, as we take for granted the principle in question, and spend our time assessing the subjects fit for it, that so do such principles come in by a similar way; whereby we take for granted the nature of things, and merely assess the principles fit for it. "Yet in that, the ancient waves of tradition hold too mightily a claim. And with much evidence to, for the tug-O-war between values newly established in the 16th century and those developed from establishments in antiquity, mark the trajectory in which governments and cultures have come. Quite unfortunatley, the larger wars within the recent past, seem merely a result of the major powers fending off those whose 'state of living' was born upon the developments of such ancient-modern conflict. In Germany namely."

<div id="composed">
   So the nature of things is such, that via observation, both our mind, and its otherwise ambigious counterpart of matter ---and converseley- are but composites of baser things. Such things appear to be nothing more than excitations of basic fields (and or field), which exhibit the properties of particles and forces. For the former, you have up and down Quarsk; two of the former and one of the latter create a positive charge, while one up and two down create a neutral charge. The gluon initates the binding force between the quarks, as to create the charges and charge relation: the body of which (of postive and neutral charges) is the nucleus. Surrounding the nucleus are electrons; and the amount corresponds to the amout of charges in the nucleus. As well, more electrons there are, the further out will they be disperesed from the nucleus: these are valence shells. Via the electromagentic force, the electrons bind to electrons orbiting other nuclei; such a union forms an atomic bond, and at that a molecule. These molecules interact with others, and as pertains to life, so are cells made. A union of cells is termed organism; and within said organism, different kinds of cells joined together is called tissue. In animals, these tissues form organs. And in terms of sense, it is all to clear that what we mean by that, is some sort of impression, and some mysterious response. 
   <br>&emsp;Such an interaction is of a compositie type; in that, of visions case, the light coming in does so individually, and by the various points of input, as reflects the coordinates of points within our field of vision, so are our senses excited in such a way. Our percpetion of such an impression, and in a composite way, is in itself comparable, in that, as the input is but a collection of light-streams, and so as to create proportions, so is our response equally composite, in that of the collected input, so is it harnessed and exhbited (to our  perception) in a compositionally assembled way. Cameras serve as an example of this. In their inital form, light would hit a surface, and a firming chemical would be placed as to hold the 'more or less relfection, or proportioned glimmer' into the surface. Illustrating this though in depth, there were indiviudals light-streasm that hit particular points on the surface. Upon each point hitting its respective spot, so was the binding agent exhibted to that point, by the piece of such agent as was placed at such point. Our brains potentially differ though, in that of the collective input, that so is this brought in, as if a solidified impression, but therein dispersed to various points of the brain for perception. The question, is whether the collected input is sent as a whole to each point, or if each point which indivudlaly came into the senses, goes to a corresponding point of the brain; by which each brain-point which recvies an according input-point, offers an according point of perception: the total being a composite perception. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps the ambiguity comes from the total-view of the sense-appartus. For it is not so true that a left and right point come in, and as a line, are inputed to the processing parts of the brain; whereby the left goes to one recpective point, the right the other. Rather, the actual input-apparatus is a point system itself; so that the left input impressess  itself to a certain spot on the appartus, and the right equally. And my feeling, is that each spot on the input-appartus corresponds to a recpective point. 
   <br>&emsp;This feels very Humian, in that, of our composite perception, it is more likely that the experience of  perception is but each processed point offering its own pointed perception. The act of processing into perception is one thing, be it whole or composite. But we can say, that whether the inputs are processed and something else is made aware as to call perception, or if the processing brings on the perception more innately, that so if if a left point came in, was processed then perceived as a point, that the adjacent right point being processed does not in fact lead to the perception of a line, but rather the perception of a right point and left one as parallel with one another: yet, per the Humian notion, that only each point is per itself percieved. "And perhaps via the actual means to perception, that the experience of said points being parallel, and at that a line, occurs." 
   <br>&emsp;In other words, that one perceives compositionaly is fucntionally true. But that, of the composition, or seemingly whole object which we normally see, so is the means to that unclear, and at that, unevident that such a unity is actually occuring. "And not a sholl of perceptions of the elements of the composition; leading perhaps to the sense of unity by their being enough elements to actually consit of something composed; yet we are in our ignorance and naievty fooled into thinking that the breadth of compositionla elements are in fact the thing composed." As if one really thought, in terms of tissue, that their body was whole, and not a bundle of cells. 
   <br>&emsp;Though, in all things, it is hard to the baser elements, and at that, affirm the prescence of actual points, as opposed to a whoole. For the truth in that matter, is that compositions of the mental kind, like those atomic, may be but feeatures of an otherwise univseral fabric, who's unaltering ripples create the seeming effects of otherwise seeming elements; only such elements are in fact mere ripples in complete fabric. For otherwise, if there are indeed pieces, then the magnitude of them is unclear. As for substance, so is the source of that in terms of a whole fabric equally unclear. Nor is the source of its ripples, as to compound into via differenation, clear. But in that, the question lies in the movement for something complete and entire, and not so of a vast amount of distinct things. "Who would need some source of motion which brought them into each others company. While the fabric needs only a gust of wind; for in the consquent ripple, so is each seeming strand already strung together."
</div>
<div id="simplycomplex">
   That all being said, it is fair to say that the form of nature is very basic compared to the complex objects apparent to us. And our perception is, arguably, nothing more than an exhibition of such simplcity, but in a peculiar form. For the motions of particles is either a) basic, or b) a feature of baser magnitudes; and thus water is a relatviely complex form, regarding motion. And our mind, as in the complexities of tissues and DNA, are but a equal kind of complexity. The mind is perhaps foremost; but our ignorance and confusion, seems the cause of us thinking that it is something distinct from those other complexities; and at that, per its special form, that by the mystery of how any form is at all, that so is the mind subject to a unique part of said mystery; whereby we attribute some neccessity to the baser motions of things, as if imposed upon; and that the mind is uniquely impposed on, and at that, in relation to the imposition: and its sender. "This comes from the ambiguity of perception, and its seeming governance by us; and from there, it seems like such governance is in line wiht, or tapping into and thus in relation to, the otherly source which imposes itself upon all things; and that perhaps, in imposition that the mind is uniquely subject to, that so is our mind such as to seemingly connect us with the special portion of the general imposition. 'Gods heart, rather than the clap of his hands."
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, of the nature of things is thus, than history merely lays as a precedent to our current undertanding of this; and it acts as a sort of disposition which modernity must reorient itself from. 
   <br>&emsp;One of the key principles for man, is that considering the past, that the explanation of change, as has come and will be, as that the evident mistakes of the past were such that, of those holding them, that the evident falsity merely led to incongruety with nature; thus causing more pain than ought be made, and less pleasure than ought be had. And because, generally speaking, our beliefs are esteemed by their output of such, that so was an experience which brought litte something which spurred us to inquire and advance. And the insight I have, is that the resistance to doing so tends to occur when the point of suggestion revovles around beliefs that people are afraid to change; and by that, the content of such beliefs is almost typically in the ways and aims of idoltry. Governance holds similar whims and cares; but the turbelence in that is more than not drawn from the conflicts of devotion. For it is not so hard to say, that of our devotions, that they are not in fact promsiing for anything beyond life; nor are they advantegous to life, 'as nature does not change'. As regars morals, these are commonly argued in favor for devotion due to the collective harmony, and at that ethics within such resolve. Only, the actual contents of the deovtion are not themsevles true; and at that, it seems fairer that an agreement to what was true was the requirment for collective harmony. Indeed the nature of devotion is one of worship and oblige; and one may argue that without the sense of some fatherly and or threatening judge, that people will not act suitably. 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, histroy lays as a sort of superstition to the divine, and the esteemed qualities which follow; but equally, resits any usefull change via the strict contents of such devotion. I cannot say entirely, but it seems that the point in which man had begun to inquire and ask, that the initial beliefs he had, and at that devotion, barred him from doing so: indeed causing the great war of man. 
   <br>&emsp;From that, I am not convinced that the nature of things has been properly defined; nor has any moral pretense of what is required for man to properly be, been rightly stated. For all the experience one has to suggest such a thing, is born from an age, or eon even, where man has been nothing but devoted. Yet in all the fraility of that, there has not been a point where an devotion to something true has been done; or that he has, in mass community, co-existed withotu devotion. It feels more historic to say, that in mans communion, that upon the core of it being harmonized by devotion, that all war and petulance was born. Now, in the modern age, or approach to it at least, the sentiments of the day are of liberty and discovery: and the riches are so expansive, that even those who we accept will in poverty lay, hold in fact similar riches. "The wilds of Africa, be it in the jungle or Sudan, is barring a complexion of the fortuned world: whereby it, and most others, are becoming developed, at that of the first kind: second even, as reached with a relatively recent and quick pace, would be dispproptialty fine."
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the contrast to modernity is in the remants of the prior age. Namely, the cultures and custom which centre themselves around the objects of devotion. But the conflict in life has come primarily from those seeking to achieve the goods and utility from living; while their opponents are those stuck in the past cares of divine goods. "But upon mere examinations, you may find much strenght to believe that such goods are made by those who propogate the merrits of devotion, for the sake of moral harmony, but in fact know nothing more than the past experiences of morality as it pertains to devotion --and thus they know no community based upon liberty and natural oblige--- nor do they say, rightfully or not (in their falisty), how such devotions are in fact true, beyond their utility; for the heart of their validity comes from illiterate and 'telephoned' testimony, and the otherwise confirmations as are prejudiced by past falsity, or the pressures from custom to do so." 
   <br>&emsp;In all of this, per the actual world, lies the broken core of Germany: through the world wars at least. For, upon Rome's demise and the Barabarian settlement, the eastern portion of Gaul came under rule of the soon to be Holy Roman Empire: Charlemgane and his father to be exact. By this legacy, the split of Germany and France saw the former as bishoped by the church, and at that, culturally endowed with the contempory notions of the Church. Upon the reformation, Germany was the foremost ruined; as the influences of the surrounding countries, upon the slightest impression in Germany, saw the highest offence: to which the country, in what is known as the thirty years war, lost a third of its population. From there, the powers of England, Spain, Russia and France grew. And indeed, modernity lent its hand equally to all of them, including Germany. But upon the Napolenic and Prussian wars, the country of Germany was hoddled beneath the strenghts of England and France. Upon the Ferdinand asssination, the lines were drawn, and Germany (and its ally in Austria Hungary), lashed out, seeking conquest. They indeed drew allies (into the central powers); while the remaining countries, who's more liberal aim was continue advancing their internal means of propserity, merely unified in order to defend themselves, and at that, cease the threat. England sought no conquest; nor did Russia and France. It was Germany who sought much; and upon their defeat in the first war, the ruins held much motive for a drastic leader to come in; and weilding the prejudices against other cultures and ethnicities --in order to gain power, and rally the public-- so did the holocaust, along with more attempts (and successes) for conlfict ensue. Allied again, the rest of the world --barring Italy and Japan-- dealt with the woes of such tradition. "For upon liberty, which England and France notably embellished, the aim of man was not to overtake and at that supercerde, but to flourish, for utility; the tenant of which held no difference between man other than that of his past. But in the present, in the lands more or less established, would he cooperate, and by his able and relished means, proceed. While the flair of Germany held the ashes of devoted policy and conflict; and despite the falir of liberty that incorporated itself through modern days, compared to the surrounding powers, the roots of Germany prominently lay."

<div id="honestconsent">
   Life would be so easy if we could just try and be happy. But there is this principle which holds me back from such satiety.
   <br>&emsp;And I can't say why. Nor can I clearly say what such principle is. It has to do with someone asking if you wan't to go out and have fun; and you reply with,'what will that consist of'; and they say drinks and food. And I have always said no to this; and felt quite incongruous with most people who otherwise would.
   <br>&emsp;At heart, the principle is one of standard over taste; as not to drink soda despite its flavor, and thus avoid the glycemic overload. Moreover, the good which come's from such refusal, is more than a mere avoidance of pain; for soda does not bring much which is terrible. Rather, it allows for the promulagation of creative and or tender interests and cares; and at that, by avoiding the soda, you also avoid its contrariety to such an experience. 
   <br>&emsp;For none can rightly say that your rigor and accuity holds little effect to your more invovled experience. One who drinks can surely do so and still enjoy the drimking, or the food and lavish converse. But the principle we abide by, is such that all toil is removed from our labor, nor is there any short amount of steadyness through our days. There is little fear, no sickness, no boredom. But our fun then, comes from things we do. And despite the actions invovled with partying, so is there little which is actually done; it's more like a festival, whereby the candor and vibes provide a sort of liveliness and excitment. But when you consider the actual acts you do, its more about taking it in. Our interests are purely in tasks, namely in reading essays and texts, writing more or less constrcutively, but heavily in a reflective and or considerate way; we play games of all sorts, from Witcher, Battleifeld, Ark and Civ; and we sink into shows such as Star Trek and Seinfeld; nor are we beyond the pleasure of long ago videos, 'whereby the times and character hold our interest'.
   <br>&emsp;As a child find's fun in making things, running around, breaking rules, seeking adventure, so as an adult, am I more inclined to heartier experiences. I bear myself upon them with equal luster, but also with the neccessary care and oblige in order to see them. It is not easy to watch a movie you've seen several times before, or a show at that; youtube is like this even moreso. Nor do games grab our attention when there similarly old, or in need of ingenuity and investment. Nor can I write when I've little to say; which almsot entirely comes from curiosity and affirmation; but such is lacking when my interest is dulled, and thus there is no care for inquiry; or I am restless or impassioend, and merely declaring how our fortune's will be. 
   <br>&emsp;I just simply invest myself into an array of books, writers, reflections, films, shows, youtubers and videos, along with various kinds of games, whose discourse and development brings me to relish; and at that, I am fond of nature, in her colors, form and shine; nor does her constancy of such offerings ever dissapoint. And surrounding this, is a relatively effortless mode of being; whereby work is nothing but the smallest employment; nor is our health and reasoning but a fostering of such ease. I am never sick, nor am I in any trembling way tired. I am always walking, listening to music, sitting upright, writing, enjoying, playing.
   <br>&emsp;And from this experience, I can say, that by chance or complacnency, that I see how certain items impact said experience. Namely, sitting in chairs hankers my ability to sit on the ground; which on principle, and in practice, is akin to eating whole foods or not. Eating sugar begrudges my body, as does eating breakfast weigh me down; nor does the right blend of strenght, stability and restoratvie training treat me to anything more than adaqueate energy and form; while doing the latter brings a solid and tender pace throughout my day. "Where industry, love and time come to bear." 
   <br>&emsp;By my accounnts, the terms richness, splendor, wonder and felicity remark something somewhat broader, firmer and fresher than that of longing, craving, recklessness or elation. These are admittedly peaks which spring higher than the tops of those former; but so do they fall. And at that, such springs are not so constant, considering their nature as shining moments, rather than entire days. "And if so, but seldom, if not passing one offs." 
   <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is in a sort of contrast to the common fancies and wishes for comfort and fun; and at that, exotic delight and luster. As such, our course of action, so far as our means are concerned, is so for such ends. And like those who's means are for those funner ends, so do we have our own line to convene with. And as per all lines of oblige, so lies in it potential contrariety: which we will merely define as anything which brings you off the line. "For sin brings you away from the path to God; as does junk and fatigue bring me away from industry and recreation. While the case for comfort and fun, is such that being uneconomical whithers away the extent to which you can afford to enjoy such a state." 
   <br>&emsp;As it stands, I am an incomplete man. For I have the cares and quality which remark the deepest interests. Only, I have little form outside of this; and by the neccessity to exist in such a way, that the required amends make me anxious. It is not from the work demanded, but the association with other people. "For it seems that upon their work being done, that they go to the bar, or somewhere fun; and upon asking me, I have no recourse but to agree, or for some reason say know. I tend to just say no, and let life go on. And indeed existing this way is fine; as not all are in such cahoots; nor are we so aversr to all matters. But it is hard to enter a new enivronment, and only therein mingle; whereby you don't convene beyond that."
   <br>&emsp;Ultimtaely, what it comes down to is that I am tensely disposed to the goodness of a day, and at that our life. As one innately knows that college affords credit, and thus means to money, so do I, in what a good life seems to me, in being wide and plenty of rich and flourishing activity, know that what affords this is your health and care. For in one, you mould the furnace which burns the coals for all your active attention; and the other, faciliates the skill and familiarity to be both drawn and able within said tasks.
   <br>&emsp;We have learned that there are things beyond this. As food is but an adjacent element to our crafts, so are itineraries, trades and friendship equally around. And despite some of this being harder to find, and at that properly align, so are some accessible. Admittedly, they may require you to sit in a chair, or pay a small fee. But so is the worth of such things sufficeint. And at that, the value of such things is not comprasmied but the things itself. Eating out costs money; and although working for so much disposable income is not ideal, so is it permissible in its own right; but for 'eating out', so is this a fatiguing use of such means. By that, going to church or temple requires you to sit down, listen, communicate, and at that, be upright while public and social; but the ends are one whereby the instruments of such task are exercised, yielding us a little recovery from our private state. Plus, the advent of an occasion brings structure to your day; which irons out the neccessary appointments of work. As well, by exercsing those faculties, and being somewhat invovled, so do you hold more ground compared to other possible relations or scenarios; which brings more ease towards those, as you are not so eager or bashfull. "And thus, the cost being time, there holds no concern from me; while sitting, and at that begging the question of our principle, so may we be discrete, or confident as per the norm: which all in all, makes for a small price compared to the good received."

   In our heart, we know a mistake has been made. For we left our home, our stbaility, maybe even a friend. Of that latter I hold no remorse, for how would I know; nor would it be but a vain experience amidst our attempt for truth. "And, admittedly, I saw little which remark much relation to to truth we then glemead."
   <br>&emsp;But now, having lived on for so long, all we've done is accumulate wellness to our living. Yet our position is such, that such living is held onto to much; and thus any return to stability is one that is all to apprehnesive. This is so though, for we are so ill-grounded outside our families offer and fortune. Yet, we know we must go; and thus, in leaving, we have left ourselve bare to such a return.
   <br>&emsp;For I never wish to do much more than the freedom given by my parent's provides. It is an odd scenario, as our simplicity and respect propagate our tenancy. But so is such a stay strictly limited. For my parents wish well for me, and at that, hold a fair discipline to our ultimate task of being ourself in a unprivate way.
   <br>&emsp;We are so private, for the procurring of such ways was done in contrast to the ordinary path; and at that, our cares and congruency fell short of the affairs of such path. And in that, we found a relative amount of joy, that being at home, 'as it was then esteemed', felt like the concillary action. But time went on, and we were asked for more; and perhaps fairly so. 
   <br>&emsp;I can't say whether the merrits of pushing me out there is well-based. But I can say, that in my heart, I at least know that it is not to our benefit or comfort to be as we are. And of such view, I accept it without concern, for of such matters which would better surround me, so are these not contrary to our dearer cares. 
   <br>&emsp;For the truth in the matter is that upon the cultivation of such cares, we disposed ourselves so heavily that obliging ourselves to dutiful affairs felt like a defecit; in both the toil and time. Now, our cares are not with much luster, but our harmony with such labors and their offer of autonomy and invovlment, is not but smooth and consistent. But as it were, we have come from a time, centered perhaps on the divergence from what our entire yuoth built towards; and thus, in all our ripe cultivation and awkward stubborness, we have cornered ourselve as to be so far out of outward connection, that finding any, be it demanded or sought, is so relatively stark, and thus a prompter for paranoi and reservation. "And as such, our contrivances run amuch, and at that over indulge in perfect scenarios, as to accomdaote our weariness."

<div id="wholeofme">
   I want limber shoulders; those which don't bear down on me, nor lug unevenly. To accomplish this, I ought primarily do dowanrd and upward facing dog. I also seek a solid core, as to hilt my shoulders, and at that, be secure while seated. To do this, I ought remain active, along with doing leg raises and lunges.
   <br>&emsp;I seek good friends, but per interest. I play Diablo, Ark and some shooters; we'll play together. I do wish for a girlfirend, but only if I like her and she likes me. Our naieve optimism that our irrelevant merrit will procure some sort awe upon me is not right. Nor should we hope for something which is not realistic. "Our view on such things should not be but 'furgal' amidst a supposed exoticness." 
   <br>&emsp;At that, from work I find commradery with peers; along with some commune with distant associates and nearby customers. My name is Ryan, we love films, gaming, writing, youtube discoure on such things. I am seeking future professions as an online worker. Right now, I have helped my parents move, and am looking to work part time.
   <br>&emsp;The most important thing to me is flow. So I work shorter shifts, nearby, and nicely, while at home, in order to accumulate future rents; all while the meadows warm up, and the mountains afford nicer spots to see them. While doing so, our in between time is spent playing Diablo, Ark or Civ; all while we read at parks, having walked or ridden. We eat brussel sprouts, the freshest oranges, the greatest soups, and the fairest breads. 
   <br>&emsp;In life, I am obliged to regard the future with our likely family. As are such partners requiring of me to bloom with integrity; so that our true wisdom is not hidden or afraid. I fear no obscurity, nor does the world's path alarm me; nor are we ignorant on the tracks of it; the former motion being one of ultiamte and peacefull insight; the latter one of understanding, and at that humility to further understanding we lack, 'whereby the points of potential threat are being attended to in droves'. 
   <br>&emsp;I simply wish to express myself. And instead of doing so in the overt contrasts to responsibility, or dreaming like a child, or from bravado, I rather harness what good health and care brings us; whereby the work from our eyes and hands bring me to a rich and hearty cheer. This needs little possession. Instead, it requires the little which our provision is staked on. At that, those exotic and or hampered delights are overlooked as passions swirling from our unable means to an otherwise dear expression. And so I sit in such inability without dreams, but rather communcate, to those I depend on, or those who agree to exhanve work for provision, as to be stably thus, and therefore commenmurative to our aim.

<div id="beesanddreams">
   So two things are on my minde, namely that of work, and making friends/relations.
   <br>&emsp;For one, I think our need is quite tame, and at that, can settle on the point we care for. Let yourself be oriented, say hello to those who you were acquainted with; learn the names of those who your not. Remark your situation if it comes up; focus yourself, and at that situate yourself, by learning more about the various jobs. Find a way to talk about games, be it Cod or diablo, star wars, House of the dragon. And all in all, seek little which you at heart care not for, or are not right to, and be merrily cheerful, friendly, hard working and ethical. You can show up, say good morning, rest between the 2nd and third hour, then say that you are leaving. And honestly, my interest is such, as to faciliate our means of living; or at leas the comfort in doing so now. Also, having funds for our PC, future moves is appealling. As is the general free time amidst our stability to play Civ and scooter to the fields and read. We like ambient music because it makes me relax and into a flow; in particular, I like film scores or soundtracks; though, if I did like normal music, it would be soft rock, ie. chili peppers. I'm really into yoga, and eating heartily. I am not a vegan, but I tend to eat in such manner. Ask people their names, where their from, if their ready for the holidays, if their taking advantage of Black Friday, for VR, new computer, tv --considering how cheap they are. In total, the smooth pace of the holidays makes for a rather clean and comfy ambivolence; for bot our home and active life, mixed with work. "And to be fair, I never felt off while at that job, nor much while on Mariner. It was only so, when we yearned towards, and acted on our expectation of interest by another. I don't think so in any literal way, but I do consider whether such remarks by me made Holly, Nicole or Bailey feel like I'd harrassed them. If I did, I hope they'd forgive me, and know that I only meant it with a plain heart. And much of our forwardness was from our kind indifference, as to merely share that I felt that way. But we have learned that such feelings were not brought on because they, or me truly, liked them; but rather that I thought they did, and felt like I was oppertune to do so. Now it feels like, whether we need it or not, or at least if we can wait, that so is the question and at that interest, care, approach or regard for someone angled little on our heart fluttering or the apprhensive mystery of whether or not they share my feeling. For in truth, you should already know, for you have spoken to them, and they you. Try chatting, skyping, going for a walk or playing games. Just see if there's something for you to do. That is what a relationship should form around. And so a) if that core isn't there, then you need not pressure yourself, to make her feel uncomfortable, by being motivated and elated by mere repor, as to usher said relation; and b) if such thing isn't prescence, then let your hinderance or nerves come from an inner confusion, that there are such flutterings, but ill-placed considering your less than wholesome view (or intent); and thus, you need not linger or embrace, but be; and if that means you are not with another, so be it; better to be ourselves, free, ready and steady through acquaintence and familiarity, than fixate our impassioned breathe on some envied, begrieved, self assured and or ashamed feeling."
   <br>&emsp;That being said, I can see that spring holds a dream, whereby the woods and bees of Pitt Meadows open up, and mellow me into a cheery state. As such, less we are asked to quickly leave, then so may we stay for the warmer months. That being so, whether not we get the job now or later is not essential. I reckon that the holidays are a great way to meet people in an occupied state, and at that, build a point of friendly relations. I only seek part time, and thus, our meager ask (for Dev) need accordingly oblige. If that is not available, or the time isn't right, then we'll wait, and hopefully get hired prior to winter. So let's just phone, say that we've returned to Pitt and were looking to come back to PCX. Were a solid 80-90 uph ---with a bit of resharpening-- and that we wish to learn more about fill rates and 'department boons'. That, and while were there, ought we draw on such elements for our reflections --as we might do upon moving, or anything of the sort--- along with seeking proper conduct and ability within different tasks: notably the register and phone. "I just want to be more involved and able, as to feel more drawn and with care as to time and producitivity. And we have our own personal adendum, to speak clearly, ask and share about youtube, movies, tech, holidays and games. Ask even whether or not someone is from Pitt. Someone even who seem's another ethnicity, ask them where their from; and whether there is alot to be said, you can end with 'and do you like Canada, lower mainland, or Pitt Meadows'; for you can share your own feelings too."

<div id="meansfordifference">
   I am not a scientist in any meaningfull way. I may test my insights, but for now, I merely wish to cultivate the hyposethis which I'd then test.
   <br>&emsp;By that, what I seek are methods and or principles for inquiry. Namely, is that our mind is to be deemed as something analagous to the derived motions of planets; or that in life, that these are but motions of equally derived objects, but whose motions are best described by 'water dripping down snow, whereby the force of one propells it through certain trajectoriees by the friction of the substance'. Moreover, we have a Humian principle, whereby the recognition of our senses is but an equally derived thing; and just as the actual sense is but a union of finer motions, so is are regard a union of finer perceptions. 
   <br>&emsp;In that way, we can remove our mind as being some distinct object which the mystery of nature has produced. 
   <br>&emsp;From there, we can merely sit on the two main questions; namely that of esscence, in both substance and magnitute; along with distribution, as to see, how beyond an entities impetus, how it actually bore relation to others to create the complexities we see today. 
   <br>&emsp;This is better explained as a pairing of compliments, in both the inquiry needed to discern the base esscence; but then the science, and or investigation, as to see a) what are we anlaysising, ie, what is the form by some method made, and b) what is said form? 
   <br>&emsp;This latter portion is perhaps the truest question. For it is one thing to say, how did the planets come together: and you say through the sun's infant debris. But upon primordial unity, the question then reaches a basic form; as to how such unity is possible --or differentation at least as to procurr complexity within a soul, yet rippling fabric. 
   <br>&emsp;But such possibilty is not itself the question; at least, of that and how something complex came to be, so are these but the ontology and law, as to make results (or unity, as observed and descibred) able. Rather, the question, is of that ability through ontology, and to the laws we see --ie, the evident unities-- so are we looking at the means to the design of such ends. Or in other words, that unity could occur, why did it occur in the manner that it did? Why weren't other laws or unities created? Is it perhaps possible that the prescence of being at all is exlusively unique, and at that bound to the results we see? Could the results now seen been apart of a basis which would produce nothing else? Or better put, could be there be any basis which did not produce what we see? And at that, ought we consider whether there are many basis', if not potentially? 
   <br>&emsp;For the true test of a base theory, is not that any literary understanding of being is exlaimed, nor the deepest laws understood; but rather, one must understand how complexions made by the former and generalizes into the latter, came to be. For you are otherwise left with a fair idea of how being could be at all, but know causal effect as to the evidence we seek to explain. "And indeed, much confusion and contraiety lies in this isse: whereby you suppose the basis' conduct as to reach the evident end; or to work back from said evidence to reach either a)  a similar basis, but with with properties that are understood via analysis, or b) an understanding which is more akin to our causal view that cells are made of molecules which are made of atoms, which are bundles of particles bound by forces; and that these, may be composed of something equally definitive, but basic, or something deeper at least --of which may be made of something baser as well." 
   <br>&emsp;In fact, beyond the ostenstive principles we use to simplify the world we seek to explain, so may we use a crowned piece of evidence to better determine the 'grooved and or complex principle' we also seek to explain. Namely, that in the Cosmic Microwave background, you have distributions of 'lumops'; and that these are deemed to be the marks of anistropy in the universe; and at that, the points which would draw more matter (due to graviation), as to produce the massive clumps of matter which galaxies are. Alongside that, is the notion of dark matter, which is proposed to be the source of such anistropies, 'as if such points remarked dark matter wells, but which dissproportionate amounts of matter would fall into'. 
   <br>&emsp;Now, the question for all eternity, is why there is such non-uniformity? This indeed is why we remark that the baser esscence of things is not merely remarked by substance and motion, but magnitude, as to reflect the results which seem caused by a less than unifrom motion. At that, we can say that of the cause of CBM distributions, that these may be merely parts of a prior chain. But the question seemingly, be it inquired of in terms of baser magnitudes, or through analysis, as to see, how galaxies for instance are in fact in their wholeness, distributed by such CBM wells, is to how such anistropies were formed. And, foremost, to the form they took. For it is one thing to state that there are anistropies; just as there is fairness to say that the universe on the whole, seems homogenous. But of such homogenuity, so is it only so on a broad scale; where in fact, each element is where it is by a precise output of the function which causes non-uniformity. "For everything would be complete, soul, and at that featureless. Which in terms of the earliest things may be so; but so is everything we now see, in all its complexitites, a seeming result of some prior anisotropy. Meaning there was something which produced the features we now see."
   <br>&emsp;In short, the definitive principles regarding evidence make the investagtive principles approahcbale; for we need not regard any output as special. But said principles are not easy to declare; if only because we have too little to state regarding the cause of the particlar complexities, as opposed to there being complexity at all.

<div id="tillnow">
   All I seek is permission to express myself. My ignorance and adolescence barrs me from the sights and or resolve to public affairs. "But we are alike most peopple in that way." In any case, we prioritze our family and attendances; and derive a warm and stable liberty from there. "Or better put, such things direct my duties; to which our amends yields the treats of success." Again, we are perhaps privilaged to regard our 'deeds' as such, and not look to the affairs of others. "But such is the times; in that of our culture, it lacks broad reason."
   <br>&emsp;In this though, as the care for what is near and dear, so lies the battle to support oneself, while thwarting the 'customary' requests by others, to possess more than whats needed. And at that, the trouble to pronounce yourself, and by that find relations, via your interest in joy and active things: and not mere possession --or the active dreams which remark one's post towards the former, all the while there unpossessed state is drawn to things which promise some movement outside their idle station.
   <br>&emsp;In that, our own care for such principle is such, that finding stability is not so hard; if at all but the easiest amends to a slice of normal things. But thereby runs the frozen sentiment of our unacquiring progress; and the, albeit admittedly youthfull, feeling of being stuck in your stability, with no room to use it, 'nor any sight of developing it'. This is for me though, and indeed our growing years have shown little which is required that can't be mended to easily.
   <br>&emsp;But I think that our remarks here are bound by a sentiment of the past, whereby all these 'stable and or impassioned' matters, were measured up against the amount of princiuple good I could afford. And by that, I can see clearly that the last peg of such regard, lies in an understadning of the world; as if, upon our balance between deep and common pleasure, that so would the truth of the world commend the former. Even now, the balance is not much of a comrpamise, but an acceptence of remission from the passions built up till this point, and the practical trimmings of our excessive free time in order to secure that which is left, and nourish that deeper good

   So our localle is quite rich in plenty. It is not perfect though, like most locations.
   <br>&emsp;To begin, the 193 walk (north) is a run away hit, for it is so easy to take that path and come back up 192, or keep going to the park. At night, you can do the standard 193, or add to it naturally. You can also go south of 193, then turn around before you reach the round about. This road is not very busy; and everything is obscured by trees or backyards in this lower part. 
   <br>&emsp;Scattered all around are little routes to walk. At our intersection there are a set of townhomes which runs you to harris; and right there is a crosswalk to go to the rec center or town park. "Which is itself a fair place to sit and read." Besides that, you have Ford road, the back lane, or the curve at 193, each bridging Harris and 193. Further than that, lies the town hall area, the back road of the Coachmem and Hoffman park. There is a big loop from lower 193 and Blakely, with two long dead end streets on the latter. Going through the school is a bust during the day, though evenings and weekends you can add to 120 by looping through there, or going up Bonson.
   <br>&emsp;The main attraction though is scootering. In this regard, the town has welcomed me with renovated arms. From Pitt, you go down the stairs, and have a paved path which continues down the back of Pitt Athletic, coming out onto lower Airport way; or you can turn right, and take  the path to Harris. That airport path takes you to the long road, which has a stretch of dike which connects with the end of the airport; or you can turn back to go up the dike to Bonson's Landing --or take the forest route. The long road has a mid point which takes you through the woods to Harris, or brings you to Hammond or 119.  There is also a path which connects lower Hammond to the lower Airport way. And from there you can enter the Hammond region, or take Hammond road up to 203rd.
   <br>&emsp;We have learned that the moutains of the north are really the souther tips of the Pacific Range; and bordering those on the southeast portion of the Fraser Valley are the Cascades --with Mount Baker and Saint Helens layed prominently in the north. The Pacific Range holds all our familiar mountains within sub ranges. Cyprus, Grouse and Seymour are of the North Shore range, bordering the Gariboldi Range which Burker and Golden Ears are apart of --they are divided by Indian Arm. East of Golden Ears lies Stave Lake, which acts as a border between the Douglas Range; which extends to Harris Lake. From there, between Harris, lies the Lillolet range, which extends to the Fraser River, and all the way up to the eastern portion of Pemberton. 
   <br>&emsp;Looking Eastward, you have Golden Ears; the left point being the Golden Ear, the right being Edge Peak, and the little bump right of that being Blandshand Peak, or the needle. The valley between this holds Alouette lake, and to east side of the said valley is summited by Mount Crikmer. To the east of that lies Stave Lake and the border between the Gariboldi and Douglas Range. Also, from the meadows we live, there lies a small hill in the distance. This is Thornhill, and holds at its base SRT, Albion and 240th.
   <br>&emsp;The grand daddy of this thinking though, is to views. For clouds, the moon, color in general, finds its greatest strid over distance. And indeed we are privalaged to be near many bountiful spots. But as one who has many allergies cannot fully enjoy a menu, so does our limitation via terrain, or time of day even, lower the vantage points of interest. For we must see the North Shore Mountains, and those of the central range. Too, Mt Crimpken and Thornhill, being quite prominent to our eastern eye, are but the northern portion of the further ranges; namely that of Mt Sumas, Mt Baker, and the far off Cascades. 
   <br>&emsp;In that, there are many known spots which offer according views. Pitt Athletic offers a fairly detailed eastern view; and near the back of it, you get a fairly nice and rounded view of the northern mountains. It is almost entirely flat though, so sitting is limited. Near the foot of Airport road, sits a dike which runs to the Pitt river. Seeing as it is a dike, there is an inherent lip for you to sit on. And although the far West of the North Shore is harder to see, you get a very drawn back view of the eastern portion and all of the central range. I don't believe you get such a good view of the east; but even the east portion of the central range can be seen. In order to see Baker and the Cascades, you need to be either high up, or on the back of a western front. Ford Road is the main culprit, near the farm path. There are also northern portions that may offer isolated spaces as to see further east, or at least be closer to see the central portion. Up Ford  Road you can turn right onto Mctavish and go to a potential spot; or you can go a little up Harris and turn down a farm path --which is quite isolated if I remember. You may be able to see Baker, but I do not know. You can turn left on Old Dewdney onto Hale road, and sit by its own lip.

<div id="vagrant">
   One's remarks about things tends to be a little awry when they are of a vagabond type. For stability being what we seek, so may we relish the amount we have as given by those were housed by; but then upon leave, be in a relatively unstable place; as our vagrancy was not so much out of need, but choice. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, our principle of vagrancy comes by our principle of simplcity; so that our dependance does not merely satiate us, but bear means to flourish.
   <br>&emsp;What I've learned over the years is that dependance is not the means to such flourishing; but that having such a meager satiety has its advantage.
   <br>&emsp;Now, that we are more or less seeking a return to our own provisision, that so is our place in dependance one that is at a minmum beneficial, in that if we work as though we were providing, then we can accrue resources.
   <br>&emsp;In this though, I feel a little exposed; as if upon our plea to work, we feel entirely absent from anything of the sort. That, and there is still a perpendicular parallel from those we depend on, as regards the pressure for such provision, and at that, our leniancy for preference.
   <br>&emsp;For I don't admitt any shortcoming to our self made stability. I also have no qualms about recieving provisions; nor am I confused as to their periodic retreats. What I do remark though, is that each state holds a certain posture, and at that suitable conduct. While we are working, while being provided, then we are merely saving; and by that, so long as we are employed, than our promise should be sufficient for those housing us.

<div id="spanahead">
   It seems that pain is but a reoccuring event in our lives. Yet, in moments of pleasure, or spans at least, so do we forget; and at that, priotizie such pleasures and the expense of future pain.
   <br>&emsp;There is a lesson though, namely in your constitution as a being; and by that, akin to your forgoing air for comfort, that so will the latter have no vessel to please while the former is absent.
   <br>&emsp;By that, I can say that remarking our learned and or forseen troubles is the right thing to do. "For those we care for will at best be subject to our own experiences, having shown up unprepared; and that is even if we can handle such affairs when they do occur, and at that, develop any sight or understanding to pass on."
   <br>&emsp;In this case, the point is one of sincere admission and remarks; for the inevitable hurdle will thwart any current and coming good. 
   <br>&emsp;The moral of this though, is not that dredd should be our proper response: as if the neccessary challenges ahead warranted such. Instead, as we would break iron to reach gold, consider your abilities spent on things of such neccessity. And from there, earn the stability to be, as though you were unburdened. For it is one thing to forgo breathing, and by that, cease to live; and another, to oblige the requisites for home and bread; but thereby, over time, develop the character and composure as to accomdate stresses, appreciate what's nice; and at that, lower the actual weight of the incoming trouble, via wisdom and skill, and otherwise raising the good you receive, via commisery and time's fortune.
   <br>&emsp;To note then, we have learned that the ultimate requirment of satiety, is one that ought be truly adhered to. For this indeed is the poster child for, 'I am fine now, and oh well, we'll deal with that later'. So that even in stable positions, we abandon them for pleasure; but then upon our encumbant return, so are we with little, and at that, forced to reorient ourselves; which drags down any current pleasure, and at that, invivtes much pain from the novel prescence of responsibility. "Life is like a spearhead, and one ought always be in line with the thrust of it; for never in their privalage will they hold so forever; nor, in their fortunes, will time offer much or demand less. For the joy in things still comes down to your engagement with things; which is not something which fortune especially faciliates. In fact, it seems our fortunes are sought due to their clearing of pain, as oppposed to the freedom they provuide for pleasure to be gained. And when we consider what such aim requires, we realize that it is not but clarity and commission; which is something that fortune merely orients from stable grounds. But only so you can fully be."

   The world's complexion is such that, of its various canders and hues, so do they return to the points once been, and by that, blend with any subsquent or prior points: which indeed, makes for much warmth in the coldest days, 'as you know that change is coming'.
   <br>&emsp;This creates a sentiment of indifference regarding our itineraries. For our life indeed will grow and end by the summer's day; but ought this be remarked upon by the elements of such course: leaving year ends and quarterlies for buisnesses.
   <br>&emsp;In this sense, we can look at the time of our lives as being bare, or blossomed; and at that, warm, hot, cold and Icy. And marbling that are the clouds; and they may be dry, puffy or overcast. 
   <br>&emsp;For the world is not homogenous, in that as you go from top to bottom, so do the arrangments of said factors change. There is a sort of mirror considering opposites in terms of relative southern and northern distances from the equator. But all in all, one really ought assess their local pattern.
   <br>&emsp;Far east of us lies a great flat. And between us and it is a line of mountains, namely the coastal, columbia and cascade. In our little neck of the woods, we sit between the coastal-cascade knot, whereby one has come from the north to meet the tip of the one who's come from the south. In that exchange, lies the Fraser Valley; named by the prominent river which runs from the eastern side of the northern ranges, in between that coastal-cascade exchange. The land is generally flat, though there are some hills, if not minor mounts and plateaus; such as the strip between central Vancouver and Burnaby. The foliage is a mix of leafy and confier trees; along with surrounding areas of farmland and fields --some of which are either public, or lined by public trails. And flanking the western side, is the ocean, and all its wafting salted smell. Due north lies the head of the Coastal mountains. These come southwest into the Northshore, due south into Garibaldi, slighly more east into the Douglas range, and fairly southeast inot Lilloete. "While Mount Baker lines the northern tip of the cascades."
   <br>&emsp;As for the warmth and hues, we ought remark the solstics and equinoxes per our hemisphere. For all I know, the winter solstice for those in the south, is when ours hits summer. At any rate, from the winter solstice, the land is completely bare, as is there a fair amount of overcast and rain. There are some clear moments, with clouds and open skies; but besides the propensity for purple hued dusks, the land is essentially devoid of color. There is mind you, a vibrant effect by light, as such blankeness takes it all in. As are the morning moors crisp in their paleness, and at that tinted with a icy blue. As the Spring equinox is approached, the land begins to blossom and warm up. There is rain, but it is not as often, nor persistent when it occurs. And by that, there comes a medley of clouds; be it souly on days wihotu rain, or in the evenings when the rain has lapsed. To note, the early approach to spring is still cold, and does not get warm till the equinox happens. Upon that though, the land reaches full blossom, and begins to settle into a consistent heat. And as such, the evenings open up for sitting. As the solstice is met, the ground is dry, and the clouds are thinned out. They remain somewhat puffy, but it is more of a dry streak across the sky. And from here till the fall approach, the air is stuffy and hot. But as that ceases and the late equinox arrives, so is there a coolness which mixes with the lingering heat. And albeit light in rain, there begins to occrue great clouds in the sky. And alas the lushness nears its end, so do the colors of it all change, and at that, offer us a lenghty fairwell, as the land then becomes more bare, cold and wet; upon which the ice resumes and the sky-coverage sets in. But for a mere time though, as the ice eventually wains, as do the rains reign their excess in. And by that moments end, the puff of all that coverage lines the common points of our day; and in that, marbles the sprouting flowers and leaves. And through warmth and heat we're sent.

<div id="soughtends">
   Needs are what, upon absence, bring us to cease.
   <br>&emsp;There are means to such needs, both in ability and substance; by which our need is comparable, in that we must exhibit the motion of breathing amidst the prescence of air. The latter is the purpose though. And in terms of what we are, as to have needs, so is it that which ceases upon the abscence of that which we are porported to. "For such thing is given the titled purpose, in that it is the thing which we require."
   <br>&emsp;Along these lines then, we can consider that air, nutrients, water and warmth are what our efforts are aimed at. 
   <br>&emsp;In this though, we come to remark the factors which give life to the according means. For if we need food, then our capability is so, that it is persisent so lnng as it can sustain the body which therein substaniates the prescence of said capability. "Like a system which provides for itself; and by the systems needs, so do such appartus behave like an appartus which is given its own being by virute of being an extension of the thing which it satiates." 
   <br>&emsp;In that, we can look at our needs and means, and say that such means have their own requisites. In htat, for food we need locomation, and by that dexterity. While the means for warmth may be found throug shelter; but we thereby need the means for resourceufllness and design. Nor is the appartus for scooping water sufficeint without the sense to find it. 
   <br>&emsp;History lays it's basic claim here, in that, by our resolve to satsify our hunger, we developed such greater means to do so that excessive efforts could be attended. And by that, economy grew, per the exchange of novel goods. And from that, so did those baser productions of food get incorpoarted inot the economy; making them goods which were neccessary, amongst goods which were novel. Only, because folk's partcipation was based on their input into the labor required to extract such goods, so were inefficneis there consquential for those who'd otherwise be subject to their own local shortcomings. For the food-system was one that spanned the country, and by that, failed those at all ends of its borders. "This contrasted the local ventures, whereby those within a clan, or a village, lived and died by their own local capacity."
   <br>&emsp;As a result, the means to satiety were found by efforts prompted by novel exchange. And through currency, folks were compensated by those whose motivation for such currency, as to offer goods in exchange for it, was so as to also offer such currency to those who aided them in producing said goods. And the moderation of such venture was merely in the proportions, so that a profit could be made. 
   <br>&emsp;Of note then, is that as such motives were based on the prospects of exchange, the fact of risk and investment into such a venture made it so that those with such motives would share in the capitol required, and then split the rewards. And although the early stages of this saw a mixture of indivudals and groups making such attempts, so did the higher stages see broader cooperation, and by that further inputs to the requisite capital. Or better said, that be it initially, where the greatest risk and potential lay, to the matured moments whereby further progress could made, and at that benefit from the capitol to do so, that so things lay.
   <br>&emsp;Through the advent of industry, the means for those with such motives was enabled, and by that, the output of goods increased, and also the potential for those seeking compensation for their contributions. Wages mark the labored efforts of the former, while equity marks the capitol and or stocked investments, and by that potential return, of the latter.
   <br>&emsp;In that, the economy is akin to goverment, in that each are a kind of soceital mode. And by that, the promise of the latter is in organization of the groups capacity, and at that, regulation of the conduct of those invovled. The advent of the former aspect is that through the excess' born by industry, that so can valued goods and producive labor be offered, and by that, quality of living and common wealth. 
   <br>&emsp;The downside, is that of that latter, that so is it banked on the availability of the required goods, and at that, the capacity for those in need to hold currency. 
   <br>&emsp;In this though, by perpetual attempts, one is subject to their according capacity; and at that, hurt upon failure. While the stability from production is one that is limited by one's work elsewhere, and it's fiat offerings as to purchase said products. 
   <br>&emsp;But in this,  I would say, that the matter of stability, and the broader notion of freedom, is such that be it through hunting or gathering, or an economoy of any varied sort, that these are merely means to such settled ends. Indeed we may remark how we are in the mode of soceity were in; but for the same kind of gain. "For what is novel and basic does not change in a value'd sense. The only difference is in the ease and consistency by which said things are acquired."
</div>
<div id="meansmode">
   So we need food. And our choice is either to gather it, or exchange cash for it. The former is limited by our abilities and permitt; while the latter is a mark efficeicny within the culture which would produce such goods to begin with, and at that the posiitions of labor as to award me the currency to purchase.
   <br>&emsp;The principle though, is that one who gets what they need, is done so through a veil that is equal regardless of mode. Those being one of gathering or exchange. And it is important to rememeber, that with the change of society being long and gradual, that all who you are acquainted with, be it family, friends, offspring, romance and peers -past or present- that so will they be of the current mode. And by that, we are all part of this collective economoy, as we were of collective forgaing.
   <br>&emsp;And so when I think of our progenitors, I see that they will be apart of an economy, and by that, be subject to the labor required, and cost of goods. As may there fortunes sway by output of such goods.
   <br>&emsp;Our remark though of the economical mode, is one that clearly varies in complexion. For the Greeks held an equal kind of economy as we in the modern world. Yet, the character of all our elements differ then them; particulary in the richness of our own.
   <br>&emsp;By that, the moment we give up on our aversion to the 'neccessary' principle, is one where we are left to see what life is in respects to that.  
   <br>&emsp;For pain, and by that token the hunger for one's need, is something which will always run paramount. "For our state amidst such a way, whereby a need is not met, is one which ceases our ability to be otherwise pleased. As our needs are such that they are, or rightly remarked at least, by the satiety of things which allow us to be. In living at least."
   <br>&emsp;For life is in many ways a mere stripe in nature's canvas. Beyond the tiny details, there lies an esscence which is merely trying to proceed. And as enzymes bear us certain gifts, and oxygen the means for energy in our cells, so do the abscences of these merely alter the form of such esscence; whereby the state we'd call living, whereby the relation with nature is such as to exhibit such living form, that so is an alteration of this but a different orientation of such esscence, as to upon its cease, be what we'd call death, or a transition into the rest of nature's flow. For life is an assembly; in that the traits we remark as being inherent to living, are but the expressions of an ordered assembly. While death is but a dissassembly, whereby those traits are no longer exhibited; and as it were, the portions once assembled drift off into the winds and currents.
   <br>&emsp;In all of this then, you have two sides of things. One, is the state your in, your condition. While the other, remarks the motions of your time and attention. The former might describe a moment of peace, in that by your actions, such was your result; while the latter remarks your will, your patience, your oblige; by which your esscence, as assembled and exhibited amidsts the rest of nature, yields a sort of state in such assembly. 
   <br>&emsp;Virtue is indeed the term used to describe actions (from one to nature) that yield the subject a fair response. Namely, if all ends, in composition that is, were coneyed as either peace or despair, then virute would be that which, considering the subjects assembly, and that of nature around, that so the relation of the two brought that favorable end; and equally to the averse end, does vice lay. "My actions are of virtue or vice according to the result they give me. I may move in the same way for one or the other; but it is in truth, that per our relation with nature, that the motion I made would be evaluated as having been of virtue or vice, upon the result it gave me. Virtue and Vice then are judgements, in that we reflect upon the result of our actions."
   <br>&emsp;It is to often overlooked that, in our assessments, that it is not enough to simply know the properties of our actions, but that of the qualities we seek. For it is one thing to say that an action was such, whereby we remarked what we did; and it is likely fair that the point we reached is also simple to describe. But as to what was dealt to us, in terms of our actual condition, so must that be remarked upon. For it is easy to say that I did such and such, and as a result, this thing happened. But this is not what virtue is measured by, but rather how such results impacted you. "Were you left in peace or despair? And, perhaps rightly so, were you, in the former even, moral?"
   <br>&emsp;For that is soul the question ultimately. Not so much that we'd understand peace as to be able to remark what dealt us so; but that, in seeing what did, that our effective choice did not cause pain to another. 
   <br>&emsp;Oddly though, it would seem that as I remark the yield of my results, that so would my moderation against others be measured by what they, upon reflection, saw as good in their own yields. 
   <br>&emsp;At this point, we have some basic properties to our neccessary principle. For man is not merely pleased when he earns his share. Rather, he works with others as to bear an excess which feeds all. He doesn't do this out of generosity, but requirment. For it is not in his nature to satiate himself alone. Not that he wouldn't be pleased if he could; rather, by his self, he is not able. At least, being consistent and sufficeint is difficult to do.
   <br>&emsp;And so by being collective, he is exhibiting a trait, or acting in a certain way, of communcation, aggreement and harmony, for ends which please him. 
   <br>&emsp;And I cannot entirely say whether morals are such, that by his pleasure in collective harmony, that he is admitting his own good alongside the admittence of other's goods. Or, if his virtue is merely one of an effective trait, in that by being collective, he finds what he needs. For in that, he is acting in a certain way as to satisfy the requirments in working together; the effect being one of finer production.
   <br>&emsp;For the concern then, is that morals seem more like something you owe somebody, while principle remarks what is wise for someone to do. And the truth in things, albeit hard to ever know, merely forrays as to what will lead to results worth acting for. While morals seem to enstate what is otherwise a given by the prescence of principle. But perhaps, the obligation in place, is there to counteract any lack of principle

<div id="thelineofexchange">
   In all, the complete inquiry of things regards the means for differentiation. Yet, it is oh so hard to show where the slight differences began; and where the aparent complexions are but compositions of such.
   <br>&emsp;For I do not know if we have a soul, or if our mind is tapping into something, or recieving at that. But so much as we are fair to suspend our assessment, so may we say, that in all entirety, so is there the baser question of being, by which all other things are judged by.
   <br>&emsp;The question then of morals, right and wrong, sin and virtue, is not much more than a feature within nature, or at least a statement regarding what we presume nature to be. For the latter, I'd say that evidence holds the soul merrit. While the former, marks a sort of challenge, in that we are at best exploring the possibilities. It is worth noting that both sides tend to converge, in that what we deem nature to be, is both inspired, and at that confirmed by, evidence which we deem laudible by its relation to such truths we see. In that, miracles lie, and all things of intervetion or thought.
   <br>&emsp;I would say though, that the basis of nature, and of a sort which is not to beholden to antiqauted concepts, is such as to be rightly tempid; as neither our physical understanding of the world is complete, and at that fully handled, for us to make any precident claims: as the ends are unknown. Nor, in the evidence that we use to conjure causes, and by that, bear a sort of 'neccessity' to our sentiments, as if such maxims must be in order to produce what we mean to explain, that so in this are we quite ill-formed in any logic or philosophy which is, explcitily, born of evidence and concepts of a modern sort; nor, in my view at least, is there much richness within such inquiry, as would remark modern sentiments brought through our liberal ways. For the past did not allow for much exploration beyond the norms. And now even, considering the baser facts established, so has there been little inquiry from that point. And by my account, attempts at such highlight what facts are not understood, or ar absent to our personal understanding. But foremost, is that in those inquiries there lies a depth which goes further down then our physical understadning can support; nor are there the right terms as correspond with such understanding, as to appropriaptely concieve of the realm of such depths; as the colors and hues of such abyss are not naturally exposed to our definite senses; or at least the state of such senses is not developed enough. But beyond the promise of our path, and where such progress can lead us, I can say, that in the realm beneath there lies what can only be described as dark, awkwardly proportioned, and at that, unsure. 
   <br>&emsp;Our deepest belief though, as if a soul spike in our inquistive ground, is that although we cannot be much more than skeptical of the truth in things, that we can say that the mystery lies not in proving that there is someting which there is a basis for. For in our apparent being, there lies a evident and concieved conposition, all  of which is sewn from simplicity. And the point is not so much to speak of the result of such weaving, but rather that such weaving occured, and by that, there must be fibres and strands to do so. "For even in our barest reduction of all things complex, there is still no supposed blankedness; or absolute unity at least, whereby uniformity and fullness is explicitly so."
   <br>&emsp;In other words, albeit immesurably simple compared to the complexity we see, so is the truth of such composition possessed of character, and by that edges, traits, grooves. For without it, it is hard to see how there would be anything but the smoothest complexion. Yet, in the earliest evidence of things, there lies the grooves of dark matter holes. "So we ought clarify the edge by which objects are basically deemed; and how the depths by which said basis, be it seperate to said objects, or a mere darker spot to their own definition, can be better illustrated and explained." For it is not a meager task to describe nothing. Yet, with a bright eye and literary fidelity, the attempt is not so hard. For our mere idea of nothing, and the presumed difficulty in describinbg, is so, as to hold inherent traits which we assume within it; and such properties are in need of a steady hand to reckon such.

<div id="cleanerror">
   At heart, I am not concerned about our place right now. For as remarks our happiness, we are free. 
   <br>&emsp;But life goes on, and as we know that we will not be a vagrant forever, so do I see that we will not be by ourselves forever. Nor will we be absent from the world. 
   <br>&emsp;Yet these things are all so far away. And in many ways, the heart of our suspense in vagrancy; for those other things are built on the requisite of us being non-vagrant; by which there is none who hold much above me.
   <br>&emsp;What is odd, is that if I consider our forutnes, be it from time, the lands, or family, I still see that what I deem as promsiing from that, there is little to do with those supposed ends of our future. If we receive money, we are not thinking of its relevance to relations or family, but travel and leisure.
   <br>&emsp;In that way, having the former is akin to buying a home, in that a down payment is required along with means to pay the mortage: meaning that it is but a matter of meeting the requirments, and earning the reward. Perhaps our confusion lies in the less than prevalent concern for providing for our family, but rather raising them, and at that, moulding them as not to be subject to, and at that  personally reach fortune, but to actually live, and by that do so to their family. 
   <br>&emsp;Yet, we are left in all of this a sort of complacent to such interest. For I could almost care little for it to be.
   <br>&emsp;One thought is that what we care for so much, at least what satisfies us enough not to seek such goods from family, is that our interests lie within blend of disregard and or unexposure to duty. For we are not required to have children or family; nor are we so discouraged. We in fact are at most subject to scrutiny over our personal dependance; yet such a situation only occurs because we find so much relief in having our meager needs met; whereby we have not oblige which bolts us to the ground. Admittedly I have been poor in making friends, and otherwise been too lavish in the one's we did make, and also foolish in our romantic attempts. And so the lacking of other's who bring security and strenght to your life is in part why you struggle to see much promsie in  novelty; and at that, much care for accessory goods from labor.
   <br>&emsp;In many ways my life is such, that it has never been but a coming or steady going to flourishing. All squelching delights have vanished; nor have the impassioned flames of our heart been tended for any blazing moment. Instead, we have that feeling you get after exercise, or success in some work or task; where we breathe nicely and with ease. 
   <br>&emsp;Pleasure is very hard to state. For sex is clearly a marvel,  as are trips and promotions surreal. And I don't mean to simplify them as mere moments. But we can say that the form of life is such, that of its entire canvas there are many spots; and such elations brighten spots of it; but do not strictly color any other. The fair admission is that, of those spots elsewhere, that the actions which effect those may be so as to enrich them, or make them pleasant, by the glowing effect from those brighter spots. But wisdom doth profess that the actions required to brighten the rest of the canvas does not come purely on the elation of those particular points; for the right choice need be elected, from the glee of those other pleasantries. "Ones' moments of pleasure bring a sort of well of cheer and intent, as to feel more free and open to do the right things. But beyond the effect of those points, in terms of pleasure, so  are the accompanying effects which they inspire unaltered by those sources of inspiration; such sources are but mitigators as to bring an action to fruition: but the end of such action remain in line with the action which brought it: and thus, and influence to do usch action is but a motivation for another cause and effect. And wisdom fairly suggests that the orientation of our selves, from reason, is both usefull and required for cause and effects of a good kind to be the one's motivated. For a thief who was brought to glee, is only then happier to do his thieving."
   <br>&emsp;Where we lie then, albeit obscure in quality, is of an end which has come by the leniance of tradition, and our otherwise forray away from its lingering threads.  For we were not damned to not have relations or strict family lines. But we were ushered to a profession; if only out of the potential benefit, or the concern of the family we some day had. But in this, I sought not such benefits; nor were such ends but far off remarks. And by that, our later youth held not but a retreat from the duties proposed, if only because their labors and chastisment was without promise. Not till the blankedness of our consqeunt state began to fledge, did we take any part in forming ourselves to what did interest us. For in some baser way, the strenght one finds in being skilled and able, or of prowess, is such as to be pleasing; in a comprable way to settled peace, but of a confident and by that reasuring sort. And as it occured, in our lapse from the affairs of romance and profession, so did our self regard (and according practice) produce a hankering for such prowess. "And indeed, for some time, upon our bareness within the abscence of duty, did we vehmently take to those self-committments." For such efforts were in themselves pleasing, and at that very rewarding in their honor and fortitude. Moreover, did they lead to an appreciaton of things, as perhaps remarked our more youthfull interests. 
   <br>&emsp;I think, that as histroy goes, that the depth of it all lies in the propogation of the species. For it is odd for someone to disregard that; or at least, considering theire nature to care for the elements which lead to such, that they'd not oblige themselves to so, or expect such things to happen. "As if compared to our expected breathe a moment from now, that family was but a gasp that we saw years ahead."
   <br>&emsp;In this sense, I am wondering how the notion of happiness comes to be. For it seems a weird, and almost exlucisviely modern concept, in the way that governemtns operate in ways that are leagues away from our own attention. There are so many people as it is, and what one person does fails to faulter the whole of the species. Yet the sentiment of rignt and wrong, and what is othewise wise or foolish, cannot be fully stated.

   For simplicity sake, we'll say there are two kinds of jobs: flexible and immobile.
   <br>&emsp;For the latter, there is the concern of being stationary, and at that powerless to heed your passions for yonder. There is also the risk of coming and going, as such jobs are about employment, as opposed to gigs.
   <br>&emsp;Flexible jobs have no inherent value; at least, the passion which a stationary job can curry is not absent from flexible jobs; they can merely respond better. Amd truly, coming and going is a novel pleasure, and can cease any staleness or depression in life. "The ability at least is calming." But the requisites for such jobs is in a skill that can be flexibly employed. As such, one must train to do so; which is not itself a drawback from the provision it provides. But, the actual use of it must be sufficient as to maintain said skill; so that the flexibility it is merrited on can be satiated by the quality of the ability. But on top of that, you must also submitt yourself to the employment. Which indeed may lower as time goes on, as the rewards of your application become richer. But so are we past the neccessary training, and into the progress through employment; whereby you grow in skill and fortitude through the demonstration of your novice means; to a point where such means become more promsiing, in that you can do more lucrative tasks; and by their richness, less of them. In other words, one must invest in the training required, but with a fair sense as to the use of such development for employment and further growth. For such a path is one that is in esscence fruitful; but by that, there is also committment and lasting expression of said skill; and one may not wish to dedicate themselves to that. Or, better yet, the novice years of said skill and their sterner needs, may not be so enticing. "For any path of this sort will lead to a state which is satiates you through little effort; but only so because you can do jobs that award satiety through meager effort: all the while your means to do so have developed to do so. For you are otherwise settled in the prospects which your novice skills can engage with." And beyond the actual good from the work, the purpose of it in being provisional holds the flexible quality of such tasks under the measure of consistency. For in being flexible, we must be able to employ ourselves with equal motion. And indeed, experience does increase your means to find such oppertunities where you go; or you may not leave your prospects due to online. "It is just simply the case, that these kinds of jobs are hard to cultivate with the meagerest amount of effort. For your promise never solidifes."

<div id="fullaim">
   There seems regards for what I care for, and those which remark others. Friendship and romance are not limited by the simple ways of the former. But the subjects of the latter are not satisfied by the extent of such simplicity. I can remark that our vagrant stake is not a stable condition for our own interests. But the care for family is not a remark of that,  but one of future equity. 
   <br>&emsp;For I don't wish to work from home for the sake of me. The work is either monotonous or consuming. And maturely, I see that our care to go where the perks of flexibility take me, are not substantial when you consider the good that your simpler stability offers. "I seek not that which more specialized efforts provide."
   <br>&emsp;I lie then with a notion that our fortunes are such as to be sought so that we can merrily proceed and figure things out. But as the pressure to figure them out not feels so prominent, I see that very little of what I concieve as happening, will not occur naturally. Nor is a gradual prescence of your being a sufficeint state as to procurr such ends. Such a state may incorporate you into the world in ways that faciliate the requisites for such ends. But such an effect is merely the result of you being more stable, and at that comfortable in being broadly drawn, or positively hopefull and receptive to things you concieve. That may occur, in that you station in the world will compell you to more things; and at that, color them with worth, to which your oblige isn't one of insecure conjurings, but sincere want: of which you happily proceed, and earn the perks of having done so. 
   <br>&emsp;Again, this suggests that if we are working and happy, that friends will come our way, as will romance. And considering we have so many interests and cares, that the whims of these, ie. in podcasts, writing, things of posterous glory, will feed off of our confidence from such happiness, and thus treat us to the goods from those things we love.
   <br>&emsp;Indeed this sentiment holds some truth. As our lack of friends or romance, in a baser way, is a factor as to why we feel to reserved in our pleasure, and at that, without enough pleasure or ease to feel peace in  our station --whereby those wants from flexibility occur.
   <br>&emsp;In that, I am not so accepting of this personal stake in things;  whereby we otherwise ignore the requirments for children. But I do see in this, that there are two paths; one being of hope from our adventures and promise; the other being from our current pressures and unsure state, whereby we anxisouly see and dream of sufficeint scenarios (to meet those familial provisions) that are in themselves pleasing. "Whereby we held a stable scenario, which was pleasing in the obligate part." 
   <br>&emsp;The first scenario feels like the hopefull one. And I can say, that if we iron out all the lingering fear and gloopy assurance, we are  left with the tender and kind stability; in that the fruits from the more humane want of romance and friends, is such that the gradual growth and acquaintence with the world from there, is as humble and oppertune as those things we seek. "Whereas behing the hot one in town, and earning the according cred, is an aligned excess."

   What is the best time to move? Well the cycle is such, considering our latitudnal constant, that it will more or less repeat in a timely manner. It is not irrelevant that you'd enter a new place on the foot of spring, or the exit of summer; but that you would feel the effects of missing one over the other, is not very mucb more than the minor experience of going through the stretch you choose. "And in accounting for our life, I can see, that through growth and maturity, that time becomes easier to sink into, and by that, let it whisp by." 
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, I can say that the foot of spring is such,  that the coming months are warm, full of clouds, leaves and birds singing; nor do the mornings peak early, or the sun setting so late. Though, once said foot has settled, the land becomes dry, hot, thin in the attire and full of haze; and the days are longer, which brings on much excess of leisure; though the late skies are nice to see, and free to do so. "And our age is such that experiencing the mornings is tough; but our bend is towards that." 
   <br>&emsp;Te exit of summer is similar to spring, in that the land lush, warm and full of clouds. But the rains do begin, and as the entrence to winter is met, so do they come often. The cool airs are nothing to be averse to, nor are the leaves falling but a final welcome. But things do become bare, and eventually frigid; eventually pitching to a freezing cold. 
   <br>&emsp;Case in point though, as time goes, that so as the heart of winter sets in, do you reach a point where it is exited, and the foot of spring is on the horizon. In late January this occurs, as the rains become less severe; or at least less daunting as the winds and temperature don't mix them into a freezing tempest. And despite the lack of pleasure from the sleeping forest, there is more room to go outside and see the skie, and otherwise rest. For the sun rises earlier, and sets latter, and all the harshness of the winter ceases. The good to come has not yet occured, but there is still much which is naturally present. And by my accounts, if life were like that forever, there'd be little to complain about.

<div id="yettoknow">
   So I have no celebreatory remarks, merely those which reflect the heart of our path.
   <br>&emsp;For our mom and dad pressure me for the right reasons. As pain, being the grand exhibitor, is not something that a mometns pleasure should be put of for. As we've learned, the nature of things continuously comes knocking on our day; or eventurally at least. Ansd whether such things are fairly known by those who'd implore me, so are they right in their sense that occurences of any sort will occur.
   <br>&emsp;From that, I can see that our want of family is a final plea for us to be responsible. By that, our need as to faciliate that is the extent of our quest; concerning duties. 
   <br>&emsp;From this, I can say that of such quest, we've marbled the end, the right in our means. But we've got a somewhat open hollow between such ends. For we are not so stable right now as to be able to pursue such things; but as our want excites. 
   <br>&emsp;All in all, I see how our course in life is such, that for pleasures which are fair and hearty, to those which are broader and demanding, that so of the path we are on. 
   <br>&emsp;But I cannot say that our strides are full, or firm at that. We've seen much, and at that learned all but little. But our currennt place is not much as to reflect that; but rather a precipce to action which remarks what we've learned.
   <br>&emsp;Our ignorance is not so prevalent, but our knowledge of things is not complete. From that, I know not which means would be best for those final pursuits. I have a sense of the qualities which would bear sufficiency and preference; but of what would fit such a bill, I am yet to know.
</div>
<div id="aplacetosee">
   So our aim is such, that to return to a point in which I'll have to leave, is both unpleasing and contrary to basic future goods. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, we will have to continue working. And indeed, there being a state of this which has a balance of preference and ease, can form over time. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, I prefer efforts which are robust, as opposed to laborous or monotnous. This is why personal shopping is great; as your always moving, but lightly. Cooperation also plays a factor, as you build peers, and otherwise soften your days.
   <br>&emsp;Another important factor is that ordinary jobs are stationary, in that you commit to the position their in. But if you stay long enough, you may transfer. At least, leaaving a job with the confidence that a new one will be found, is not only unnerving, but also a little deterimental; as you loose your credibility and stake. "At least it seems like something which you'd be better to hide; that you'd come and gone to so many jobs."
   <br>&emsp;Now, there is the richer matter of wage and quality. The former comes through higher kinds of jobs, or specilized ones. While the latter remarks the form, namely in that you'd work remoetly. You may also do something meaningfull, and by that warrant your station. 
   <br>&emsp;In the simplest terms, these kinds of jobs are either steeped in requirment, or monotnous. There may be some which are not, and our resourecfullness will tell. 
   <br>&emsp;But an important remark, is that whether you must look and at that heed, or see and work towards, that you must be in such a place as to rightfully see the end you seek, and be drawn by it to go through the requisites; or, even in simplicity, you ought be able to apply yourself for such things. Better yet, that doing what is less comfortable for the sake of more money or flexibility, is a mark of your stature, in that you are not so sensitive to richer yet harder things. These sentiments have to do with the gradations from stability. In that, if you are secure, in that your needs are truly met, and that of such security there is space around via the advents of leisure and friends, then your skin will become thicker, your confidence more malleable, nor your dreams so depraiving, 'as you otherwise feel distant from a point which contrasts the lesser one your in: the one of which draws such far horizon'. 
</div>
<div id="destined">
   There is this sentiment which I have sought to explain; and I think I can.
   <br>&emsp;It goes simply, that our work is meant to seep provision. And per recent insights, such provision is not based on what we need now, but a family ahead. Indeed, the state of our development may be so, as to remark our progress along such means; in that we were at a certain point to faciliate an according measure of want; nor were we lacking headway to grounds ahead which would faciliate more. "And our principle is such, that such ends ought be destined for the provision of family: for not much else is required but what the world asks for you in integrity, or the world in your opinion. And such means are in abundance now: and merrley flat because of our construction of it, rather than a lack of tools."
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, this future sentiment is atop the finer grounds of personal interest; whereby the means for such are as simple to faciliate our creative whims and expression. Such needs are but what satiates our stomach and rest: and thus the income for the according food and bed. 
   <br>&emsp;In that though, the truth is that such affairs are not in themselves promising for those future ends. Nor are they at all sufficeint in their current state.
   <br>&emsp;And the sentiment I mean to explain, is that so much as I don't care for that future end, that being dependant or not in terms of personal stability, differs only in the constancy of such stability. As those who you depend on, family namely, are not so lasting in their vagrant support; for they wish well for you in those final demands. 
   <br>&emsp;It seems that our interests are free for expression when we are the ones providing. But in that, we are merely at liberty to be on route or not for such final ends. "And your family is not going to otherwise let you fail. All the while, your effort to support yourself, is free to do so in vain."

<div id="torncomplete">
   So consider this line of thought: Plutarch, as a dutiful man, who writes and smelters for his own pleasure and place, compared with the likes of Descartes and Hume, who seek much from their inquiry, as they doubt the declerations ahead, but in that, find no pleasure in merely thinking, but knowing; and by that, they seek praise and applause, as to warrant their quest, but are in effect worn thin.
   <br>&emsp;In regards to Plutarch, I see his free time like a garden, in that he means not to sell the fruits, or earn acclaim; he might, and considering his novel attention, so may the expression of such as grown from his stability offer him some breadth; yet he does not care if he faulters, nor does he yearn to be heard, or finsihed, for in his duty he's already won; and in that, he is both calm in his wonder, and unsubjedted to the hopes of infamy; nor the associated fear of disdain. "For his duty already absolves him from the need to be known and seen: for he is already acquited. Yet steady, and as such, able to see by the fecundity in his oblige; whereby his gifts naturally extend, in both constance and design."
   <br>&emsp;Descarte and Hume on the other hand have this restless search for mystery. Yet, there is a contrast between the two, and of the sort which may remark their complexions. For both seem inquistive, and through that skeptical. And the source of this seems to occur by the falsity in the accustomed declerations. Where they differ, is that in order to find the truth further ahead, Descartes begins at the base of things, prooving he exists, all the while he doubts everything less reason provides; while Hume seems but leaned back, away from the indignence and cleracy of the accustomed front. But while Descartes creates the world anew, and finds in that a sort of novel understanding of the world, Hume merely inquires, and in that moves further than the truth once known, but to a point which is not itself complete. In that, Descartes is whole, yet mixed with ignorance and or complacence to his certainty. While Hume is merely alive and well within his further unknown. As such, Hume is remarked as being cheerfull and gallant; an instance of which is remarked in his tender comment regarding the false claim of man's wickedness, as compared to his ignorance --and that being the source of which we think is otherwise wicked. Descartes though, despite his adult acclaim, reaches a certain point as Nietzche, in that despite their productions and praise, they still remain inquiring, and bare the effect of being worn. Perhaps the key difference is that Hume is more happy and able, in that the unease which motiveated his inquiry was merely to state what he thought; wherein he moved past the norms, but by mere expression of a more well founded truth -albeit unwhole. While Descartes, and Nietzche similarly, sought to rebuild; the source of which can only be remarked in some form of their inquiry, as reflects the depth of their doubt. "While Hume merely saw false reasoning, and sought to speak clearly: while the former two saw a foundation in need of renew." 
   <br>&emsp;In effect, you have Descartes and Nieztche, full in their acclaimed ways, yet still pondering, as if the weight of being proper in their completion wore upon them; for as history shows, more thinking and fact was to come; so almost certaintly there fuller theories were indebitaly false. And my suspcion is that they in some sense knew that. Or at least by virtue of the evident adolescence of their thoughts, so was there still more for them to ask. While Hume, in all his gallantry, seemed more pleased to have offered what he thought, and by that progress, won. While the other two seemed more enstated to the wholeness of their offering; which in terms of  reward was perhaps foremost; for as we all know, Hume was only later in life remarked, while both Nieztche and Descartes were heradled as young men. The point however, is that upon the statement of a complete sort, that so did such an appeal by said makers, in terms of the care of such statement by such makers, weigh them down by the nature of such propsitions; in that, by their being supposedly whole, that the measure for things is almost always further than that which you can properly profess. And my point is not that the demands of the public, as remarked their fame, led them to further perfection; but rather, that their own care, as remarked their offerings, of a whole statement, did not absolve them of restless need or want upon such statement being made; as such a statement, in retrospect, and perhpas by the still present difficulties of whole statements, brought them to an endless weary. "Whereby what they sought, were credited to do, or merely thought by the liberty to do so,ledgered in them a ceaseless plea to reach said perfection. Fools of which they may have been, in that their methods were poor and false. But more than likely, it was there unsettled composition as to seek such completion, and see little in what they had, but what was still wrong." 
   <br>&emsp;Plutarch on the other hand is sentenced to something of an oddity. For if a man, less composed and centered as our friend, implores the idea of truth, then what is our friends actions worth? In that, of their supposed stabiliy, how are they rightfully so, when such truth is not known? Better yet, what worth is there in his novel offerings, when they are, for argument sake, mere thoughts; and not something which justifies his supposed stability, or advances the truth which would.
   <br>&emsp;I'd remark Caesor's words in this case, whereby he says 'that things afar seem larger then they actually are; and upon coming close, they seem so small'. By this, we are to understand that what we believe to be the case is not always a proper subject for judgement; in that, despite the readiest and fruitfull resolve upon a certain scenario, that such amends, or the need for any, are not themselves just by their very relation to a supposed event: said event must be there, and of the complexion in which our conclusions are based. Otherwise the proposition is wrong, and any lauded appeals based on it. 
   <br>&emsp;And the point overall, is that those who's inquiry, however flavorable, is born from restless pining, or at least an unceasing need upon the steadiest of progress, that so are the claims and or appeals from such squanched and squinted eyes unbecoming. "As the perfection which they see, or deem to be there in the mould of perfection, of which the properties need only be told, seems more a mark from someone whos sense of such a thing, in structure or filling, is from a hurried and leary mind." With that sentiment we may rest upon the ever advancing laurels of what bears warrant to our actions: whereby right and wrong, and at that bad and goodness, is bent upon the scale of which we know so far as true. And nothing more than what that moment suggests.

<div id="allwecando">
   So thinking of Plutarch, he seems the man whos efforts are born from the lessons of yore; in that, upon his lapse of responsibility, he learend the reason to amend; in both need and award. I compare him them with Hume in that each are quite settled in their path, in that life affords them needs which are common to most, and their place, per the collective of said most, is to be as they are fit within said most. Which in all simplicity, is to partake in the mode of such collective, be it governed, pastural or economic. And to cite our prior point, any caution and or concern as to the rest of the world, all while you partake in your own moral affairs, seems to be drawn by to hasty an eye. There are indeed things which are upsetting, and the conduct of the world does seem to stem from the accustomed truths, and their effect on culture and policy. But so ought one not hurry themsleves to a further truth, but simply speak their mind, offer their opinion, express the statements they think that truth would reflect. 
   <br>&emsp;But time must go on; and if we think that if we just reached completion that all would change, we tend to run ourselves over, and fall behind the ever-constant pace of things. Such things can be turned, but their results take centuries, if not the very least decades. And perhaps, as not to be flustered and worried about the inefficiency of the world, ought we be, in whats normal, and what is in all reason fair, set. For it is not so hard to find, that upon doing in a centered way, that our view of the world, in both its custom and effect, becomes less glaring or concise; but rather a medley of oceans and seas, lakes and streams, ponds and varied gusts of wind. As such, we see the world as less a point, but rather a broad system, of which we can only speak of in according terms. In effect, there is no event, or sight of said world, which is so as to draw a sense that perfection is needed; or a thing entirely to be found. For the truth in things, is that all the worlds knots lead to tighter points, or loose ones, and those enriched. But those sowers are but those rightuflly or not commissioned, to attend to their points, and mend them through the days and constant time. As such, our opinions are all that can be offered; as to influence those near and around us, or to some one who's commissioned effort creates too tight of knot. And by the parlance of credulity, so is the influence to one the source for another who's farther; as impressions get passed along. I believe this is why those prone to inquiry seek literary fame, for by prior times, and our expressive sense, that such fortuen and acclaim regarding such efforts is the way for broader changes to happen; as, per our word, so do more hear it. But none who are seeking such infamy, be it out of sympathy or whats vain, really have so much to say. There may be underlying influence, but only as much as you are in suspense enough to ask the novel question, do you produce anything worth remarking. And by that, the purest thing to do, is that which is not hasty or full of derision, but rather to do spread that which comes to you naturally, in your obliged state; one of which begins as if instructed, and that despite any true perill by which change is needed, so are we at least in line with our own affair. From which the mark of any with the plea for inquiry, comes gradually, and with a fashion of pure conception and regard: for of the world, of our wishes, to ends which were afraid not to me, so are we uninclined. Rather, we are at rest, treated, and at that wholesomely pleased. And what our eyes see is welcomed; nor is anything liable to imagery druged within us, but set with proportion; in which our sympathies are whole and fair, and not sweltered by grimmness. 
   <br>&emsp;To this, I say, with perhaps all the might of one who is calm enough to deem it, that by the ideal command, and our own false labors that have brought us of trajectory, that we ought be as such deeds would instruct us: or revert back to said path. "Wherein guidance is not that which bears us forward, but back."
</div>
<div id="missedends">
   It is strange to consider that our instruction in life was wrong. For we seemed to be angled towards a set of experiences that our lessons were based on, in terms of what we could expect. 
   <br>&emsp;And indeed, our later life has levelled into seeing that the elements of such offerings were not far off; but in terms of their complexion and hue, so has the past, and our own sensibility, revealed otherwise.
   <br>&emsp;For I see that a child is a dear want. I may not desire one now, or a deep relationship. But these are bound to happen. And so much as they do, so are our personal efforts, be it vagrant or stable, strictly ill-fit for such affairs. "As they are, in all bareness, comparable to homes and cars, in that you must meet the requisite costs, including maintence."
   <br>&emsp;In that, per the truth in this, I see that our life's amends is such that family requisites are required. As far as I know, the cost of this is such, that for myself and partner, we need little more than what pleases us, and any minor addition in terms of what is practically required for bonded living; and for preference. But as remarks a child, of which I am sound to only have one, I see that our requisites are in principle and strict cost. For I don't believe that, beyond the special contents of the beginning, our need is to provide much more than we need ourself. And by that count, if we could offer what we each require, then the need would be as much as combining half more than what each of us already provides: as to warrant an additional hole. As our pairing introduces novel if not desired developments, so may our family be similar. But in esscence, beyond a small living for the two of us, to a more moderate one, so is there a relatively small living for our family, and a moderate one beyond that. For once we introduce the scale for instruction, we realize that our interest in having children is not much more than natural meaning and care; and of what we hold our child's interest to be, so is of the truest sort. Which is not, upon a brief relfection, impacted by living conditions beyond the moderate sort. 
   <br>&emsp;Briefly, I would mention the novel aspect of modernity, in that we can easily work remotely; and as such, live remotely, and by that, travel with our kid. Let us say though that such means were not available; and that, despite having such econmic means, that the oppertunity was not much more than occasional travel. For perhaps friends, or medical needs, required that we be in Canada longer. And to our point, in a permanent fashion, in terms of remaining local. What then would our life look like? For we'd satiate our own needs and that of our child. As would we raise them with composure, and the principle deed of integrating (our kid) with other people. But as I then think about education, work oppertunities and self expression, I am left with a blank sense of what we mean to do. For our life may in fact remain the same. And from there, we are more or less kept till our kid becomes their own. But that is likely a decade and a half away. Though perhaps the irons keeping us local would cease our child aged. By which our novel advent of remote work, could permitt us to travel. "For their development could have already occured, and they'd have more means to socialize and mingle in newer areas."

<div id="happilyshot">
   I feel happily shot, 'like someone, disposed to peace, but is nervously comfortable'.
   <br>&emsp;It is not in any fair sense, the fault of those which spark our angst. Such a proclivity comes from the awkward bent of our soul. Nor do our questions as pertain to such soul, 'as if were were identifying the nature of that which was wrong', holds any real merrit when it comes to our insight; for such remarks really amount to compressing yourself out of this confined state, and in effect, drilling forever inward to some supposed source. The aim of this though is negative, in that it comes from our response. And as such, like the sun's glare, we turn away; but with the consquent neeed to find somewhere to go, in which our source being the problem becomes the fixation point. Yet we only burry further, never reaching a fixed end. "Like the awkard contraiety of nature's solid prescence, yet is more deeply evident to be small, bare, hollow." And our weary time comes from reaching for that voided point.
   <br>&emsp;In many ways, the mark of a man is in the simple fact that he's being one. Without comparison to other objects, I merely say, of the one which are, of a sort, are we so when we can speak, see, hear and touch; and with a sort of rigor, in that we are not to stirn or forwardly wrenched, nor to layed back and soft, but firm rather, solid, real, pure. 
   <br>&emsp;Our regression burns via the coals of kindling. And such things furry is up, and earn our mournfull care. But we are not but that which is born from 'drying the timber, and making us excitable'. And the irony is that in such a diffused state, we spend more time near the flame. 
   <br>&emsp;For in many ways the root of our ends is from our choices. And such choices, as make us dry and suscpetible, are bade from a ignorance to rules, and bumbling inquiry. A sort of conduct in which, less you remain enriched as a fool, 'you don't trust yourself, as you know the good that had once been before'. The burnt state were come's from a sort of tearing contrition, whereby we hastle ourselves out of this poor state, but invertly pitch ourselves into the ground; the effect of which, bares its form in  the way that such a pitched state seeks thing. For the things which are dear are those which we find delight in, in and from a state of joy. While the care we have in a burnt state, are of that which such a state can recieve. The treats of the former come only to those who have seen, and from that mould themselves to gleam further, and as such, hold no entrence to those whose sight has whithered away. We are so happily shot though, for we find remants of such pleasure even in our pitched state. Only, as we comfortably drive through the lands of gratuity, so are we charred in our surrounding epxression; in that those former goods, despite there lingering place, loose such prescence; making us somewhat resorted to keep to the goods on our drive, and to the effective end. And perhaps the point I mean to make, is that such objects, in all their flavor and charm, hold not whihc my memory dreams of of the past, nor what my content and pleasure relish as a promised future
</div>
<div id="sightandscenery">
   The world of deduction bares us a brute end. Inquiry though, and working to principle, rather than from, is not an argumentative process, but one of observation. 
   <br>&emsp;From that, we remark upon what we see, and ask what it means. We may reckon the terms, as in the notion of how there's anything at all, or maybe we, in a scholarly or illustrative sense, paint the portrait of such observations, understanding what they are as objects, and what they mean. 
   <br>&emsp;And like Socrates exposition, Aurelius' reflections, or those comparable strides of Montainge or Emerson, so do we turn such sight towards ourselves, seeing who we are, and what we mean.
   <br>&emsp;There is a improper property though of this inquisition, namely the relation we have to the world, where we wonder how we are as to earn meaning by such things; in a similar light as to say, beyond what something appears, how it is in relation to the baser strands of nature, and being in general. By my accounts, this distinction between us and the world, and that of objects and the world (or nature), holds more sway via tradition than it does from merrit. And indeed, those blunt strides of deduction come from our attempts to be as such, where the admitted mysteries of ourselves (and things around) drives us to make explicit statements.
   <br>&emsp;Here is the beginning of things though, the channel for process. If we are to inquire, it is because we wish to and can. But the response to our prompts, which curries us to keep forward, is a remark as to the frontier yet ahead; and our according immaturity. If we are to deduce for the sake of completion, we are doing because our investigations are not full in their yields; and almost naturally so, considering they only mean  to desxribe and illustrate, rather than know. 
   <br>&emsp;In any case, we might say that our observation merely exclaims what's seen, and by that, concieves all things which urge our inquiry as things of an equally happneing sort. In the same way that the motion of the moon is but a sight we've seen, so is the rapid beat of our heart but a remark made, during a moment of exhaustion. Indeed, there is still a unmodern vocabularly as to the motions of our mind, in terms of our fear and curiosity; but the point still lays. We are not here mending words in order to reach some alternate deduction. Such an attempt would have us but in a different dress, but equally ordained to faulter. Said ways are but a blatant acceptence to our inquiry's shortcoming, and the consquent concession to proceed with the certainty which our observations can draw. The point though, is that said proclomations are but a stronger guess, there being some evidence to support them. But the consquence is one of disagreement, and the irony of there being so amidst a proclaimed certainty. 
   <br>&emsp;In that, I mean only to say what I see, and remark ourselves by a continued inquiry. The subjects of such pursuit are but rooted from things far and near that I've noticed; and as I have motions while running, fleeing and at rest, so are there finer motions --comparable to those dextrous-- when it comes to remarking upon things, and furthering ourselves as our observations spring. For instance, our angst is but a clawing sensation, pinning our openenss against a gritted wall. As in many cases, our very ailment from this blurrs our sense to recognize that we are experiening a symptom, rather than normality. But via the domain of all experience, and the natural bent of men and their outputs to other's around, so are there enrgaved motions and experience which trickle out of these confined and senseless states; to the point where a clear recognition occurs, and resolution attempted. 
   <br>&emsp;Weirdly though, those prior experiences which hold there place beneath the surface  level disturbances, have there place via similar recognitions and resolves. Said motions may have been brought on by parental guidance and pleas, or the bulk of common strides which retain in us some core propiety. Riding a bike for instance never goes away, even in a delerious state. Nor do we lose our means to read, speak, walk and breathe, despite possible erosions from a current ailment. And the point, is that in all things, or moments rather, some recognition and resolve occurs, if not by a drip. In a word, the slightest slope will bring all water to the sea, and by that, will the ocean rise. Our experiences fair accordingly.
   <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst these subjects, or recognitions in myself, is the lack of curisoity regarding death. It seems common, in drama at least, that children often wonder what death means, and what happen's when we die. I would say that their somewhat concerned, and likely so for they've heard remarks about; such things being the charms of the wind blowing by from time's past. But looking at the source for such gusts, you come to the question as to why anyone remarked upon death at all? Is it for the simple reason of closure, or comfort; to know that a loved on, or yourself, were set for some fine destination? I really can't say. Nor am I left with anything but two glaring points, namely as to the concern for a destination at all, and whether or not such concept held a dual end: meaning that the afterlife was regarded, and the promise of the light side being reached held one's comfort. 
   <br>&emsp;But both sentiments seem obscure in their origins? And only mention that, for in our current time, where the utterings of such things are, as I said, heard through echoes of older ways, and by that  practiced by those who gleam to such, but in private, that so are we in some sense left with an original question, like those in that rooted past. For we are not presently with any pre-conception or influence to what death would mean, nor, I admitt, is there much which strikes me as being relevant about it. In fact, considering that we are influenced by the words of others, and in a better light, encouraged by those who, depsite not being afraid, still reflect and define for good in inquiry, that so in our own remarks, have we relished in a fair and simple concept of death, one in which the comparison to sleep has me seeing both as calm and gentle. "Such a statement, albeit driven out of curioisty and principle definition --and not fear- holds in me a sort of strenght and secuirty; for death indeed, albeit not inherenlty frightening, does hold a sort of neccessity; and by that, having a defintion gives the course of yuor life some sense." And it would not be right of me not to mention the obvious notion of death's appeal, when the fact of its mystery pairs with that ultimate point of it. But I am not sure whether the culture which developed in terms of it, was so by their own means to develop some sort of finality, for it's own sake. 
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, I reckon the most prominent source of our regard for death, lies in our closer mysteries, namely mentaility. For such a thing, whereby dreams, vison, fear and doubt are colored, holds with it the deepest yet obscure relevance to our life. And I believe that, the weight we fairly give to such things, in binding with the little of it which we truly know, makes for a sort of baser uncertainty about things. "For we don't even know ourselves." But it is not so far off, by my account, to suggest that the obscurity of death does not pair with the obscurity of our mind; and that the apprhensions and wobbliness which come from the latter, meld with the nature of former being unknown. There's surely more to this, but we might say, in one sense, that our condition, or provclivirty rather, to be nervouce and or unsure, makes the greatest thing of uncertainty, in death, the more concerning. This is likely why the steady man still benefits from defining death, for he is at least sure amidst his comfort; while someone less sturdy, seeks for a relief to their fear, the defintiion of which bears them said claim.
   <br>&emsp;Where I land then is in the managment of oneself, and how this, by its ordinary stability, procurrs that indifference to death. For like a threat approaching, even the bravest of us locks onto it; unafraid sure, but attentive to the thing which their bravery holds them up to. But those nervous act the same, and likely moreso, in that their fear of something, draws their attention to it further. And so, by one's proclivity, not only is there view of it likely different, but so is their care for it equally less. 
   <br>&emsp;The question though, is what would bring a man, in all his composure, to attend to death; or find reason and principle to do so. For I am sure that there are other men like me, who have no fear of death's mystery? It also may be so that their confidence brings their attention elsewhere, and away from death's waiting eye. By that, death never scared me, or alarmed me personally as we made our own broader attentions. But, the nature of such attentions were such, that our grip on life was not solid; and so the postive response from defining death, brought with it some strenght for that. As I'd state it, our efforts brought us to an open view of the world, and with that, an annoyance with cheap words, a fear of whether they might be right, a rancour as to our self-inccured afflictions, and a cheerfull heart which bore us a measure for such contraierty. There are life lies.

   As in most things, our limited knoweldge prevents us from making simpler inquiries. In this case, I feel too stuck in comparing deductions with observation; and at that, the irksome point of poor concepts home to the former.
   <br>&emsp;But alas, I can say, as I think I last mentioned, that my life is such, that it found itself moving a certain way, but in such strides as were in relation to the world; and by that, the obscuirty of such extent brought with it a tearing sensation, 'as if there were fires on the horizon'. To this day those flames still flare, but it is our personal solidity which has rendered them less scorching.
   <br>&emsp;Where I fail, or have not yet succeeded, is in a full portrayal of the unknown world. For deductions are not wrong, nor are the results of observation truly insightfull. But there is a great deal to say, and winding all the aspects together fairs a great struggle. For it is hard to remark upon things, when you admittedly suggest they are not in the way you use them. But as deductions take things for granted, regardless of merrit, so do those who suppose do the same; in that their observations  lead them to principles, or assumptions, which are in accords to an accurate view of the world. Yet the ground still has depths to go. And at heart, it is that tug o war between the course to knowledge, and the completion of it; the latter always being evidently premature, and the former never ceasing course.

   There seems not much more to life than experience and principal. 
   <br>&emsp;However, each seem to be derived from some deeper truth, and a contested one at that. Namely, that of our experience, so do we mean that which we've observed, or been impressed by. And to remove the confusion of sensibility and objects, let us simply indicate this sentiment as one of relation; as we would describe a balls bounce of a wall, to which the motions fairly lie. For the other, lies the root contention, namely whether the source of our principles and declarations are completely born from experience. As a likely result of experience being the source of said affirmations, so to the limits of our relations lie as the spring for declaration: as not to be stuck progressing throug inquiry. But beyond the motivation and resolve, the point lies in whether or not our principle reasoning is born from what we have already experienced. The Humian in me says it does; at least such sentiments do suggest this. Namely, that of the truth which we proclaim, be it of neccasary motions and conduct, to the meaning and or reality of objects on terms of that, that so does a) the urge to affirm come from our experience thus far, and by that, our incomplete dealings with the world, and b) that what we see as born from the truth (now affirmed) is too bade from experience; nor, and formoest, do the elements and or strides of our reasoning bear themselves from anything other than what we've experienced so far. Indeed, one of the fair contentions is that, albeit true that our sight and hearing are impressed upon by the world, and of such qualities which we'd see and or deem in reaosning, that so would those inputs bear the source of our notions: the material if you will. But it is otherwise said, that of our thinking, in it's varied form, that these are not so much the senses in play, and by that receptors during experience, but rather something innate, intelligence, on par with the deeper streams of nature which we suppose. In a Humian way though, I'd wonder how our regards for such thinking are identified without the contents of our sensible impressions. Is the form of something, be it in color or proportion not derived from our experience with such qualities? And in many ways, there seems not but a progressive dimunition of abstracteness, whereby the subject of our thoughts is not merely an arrangment of what we've experienced, but formed in our mode of thinking. Mathematics seems the key mystery then, for the marshalling of logic, or deduction rather, still uses subjects that bear there cloth from our impressions; while numerals seem inherently abstract. But I would say, that our sense of numerals being so, comes not from our imagining of them, as the vision of 1 or 2 still holds with it some objective form. Rather, it is the relations which we deem, or see mathematically, and the consquent feeling that their reality is beyond objective. In this though, I would say that as we remark upon things of a real sort in such way, as to correspond with proportions and relations, that so do the strides of mathematics merely stem from what is inherent to the syntax. "That if such and such occurs, by the natural relation of numbers, something happens." And by my account, this is itself an observation.

   I say these things, in part, because of our modern times. Times of which the truth is able to seen, or rather sought. But so in that, lies the free expressions of promiscuity, things obscene. And by that, by whichever cause, our course into the world's view brings with it burnt impressions of its harsher matters. And to that I care the least. For violence and tryanny are not clean subjects. But as material, and something which we can relate to, so are the impressions from inappropriate things a detriment to such ends. To be clear, said things are not inappropriate, as in the case of poor behaviour, but rather as sources for seeing the properties of those harsher subjects. For one, these sources are quite oppressing, in that their form is very dense, saturated and expressive. This does not lead to understanding though, but merely a pure digestion of everything they offer. On that, the actual merrit in what they have to say makes this consquence a fault, simply because the quality of their impression stands small besides those of other sorts. Said alternatives not only leave with you a fuller impression due to the conduct of their form; but so does the material hold more nuance and proportion. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps, by our younger ways, we were so overt to the common path, that the submission to one more freeing and liberal, held with it an open lane to the farther parts of the world. And from that, our igorance of such matters lead to a mixture of over-confidence, 'as if we in fact knew', and gratuitous contempt, 'where the apparent elments of the world gleamed upon us, but without any accuracy or proper receptiivty (by us)'. And this is why, by our irksome despiar regarding such ingestions, did we lawyer over the inneuendos and promsicuity which we normally consumed. Such things have their place, and like in sobriety, so is it partly pleasing. But our pressue and condition towards the fuller world, hold no bars when it came to awkward insights of it's total elements. And through reflection and honesty, we recgonized that our nomral ingestions were both sourcing the imagery which those foregin ideas were made from; and otherwise rotting ourselves away, as we sought to see the world without being tugged by such novel elements, and better yet define them with proper sources.

<div id="oldaims">
   My brain is burnt, and I'm putt off by everything. I appreciate that our emotions are not so filled with envy and fear; but the former does seem to linger, albeit postive, while the latter still comes up, when something less respected by me strikes our cooked mind.
   <br>&emsp;All I'll say is that we are a certain way, and from that, open ourselves to thorny impressions. Why we are such a way, time does tell. But as to the form and pace of such state, that is more remarkable.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the time of my youth was met with a sort of lifeless commissery; whereby the sentiment of school and profession held me in a muted gaze. I rebelled though, recklessly in some cases; by in that, as our turn was not so horrid, so did our neutral state prime us for a different path. For we had always been young, open and kind, but held not grit or delight in the promsie of tradition. As I mentioned, our contarry efforts were of either idleness or gratuity; but so did our environment and natural complexion shed off the harsher sides of this. Leaving me then in a tempered state, I was struck by things of a redeeming sort; in the way that those in struggle turn to idoltray. I did the same, particularly when it came to productivity and prudence. Guided mind you with a modern bend. 
   <br>&emsp;Here though our story lies, for in that wake, we shed off any lingering attention to the properties of norm, and instead burrowed ourselves in to the matters of health, writing, and eventually reason. As it happened, those early days were ripe with vehemence; partly to affirm ourselves and void negative reception, as well as to inbed our simmering passion for a life further and bound. As time went on though, those emtions began to bade, and the eagerness to please and obsess washed off. 
   <br>&emsp;The result though was not one of grand progress, but rather solitude and mute sentiment. Our life was rather ornate in the basest of ways, and our free time and care was laundered by nothing other than our novel pleasantry. The story goes though that we emboldened the latter by reading older texts, and found both merrit and means in our self-goverened way. From this point our life pitched up, but not to any fufilled end.
   <br>&emsp;You see, that early portion of our formative ways, was one that held a clear villain: the lack of living which would produce depression; and the promiscuously gallant life which we held too little love or fortitude to embrace. By that, it was easy to ignore the future and sink into passivity; and otherwise grow into those reverant ways. Such reverence though did not procure much more than novel satisfaction. There was a large amount, but the world around seemed either intrusive or contemptable. I'd remark the fact that in those days we'd plan everything; from meals to bed time. While our more settled chapters held less reservation to naturally be, as perhaps guided by our experience thus far. But you see, therein lies the change, in which the good which I procucred against the bad of tradition, that so did our 'tradition' develop into a full and settled state; whereby we needed no more aversion or aggrssion towards such norms, but rather to simply be ourself in the way we pleased. Indeed, there were lessons, and much of our matured stated brought with it the mud of prior emotions. 
   <br>&emsp;That is however, the concern for the recent past and our coming memories; as such strides are what we'd remark upon in terms of the bearing our past deciions gave. As for those times, it is the case that we sunk into ourselves, and held less occupation by purely being ourself. We had been so obsessed with such as a matter of validation and engagement; propogated mind you by the happiness this brought. But as the heat from tradition died down, and our ease of reaching finer pleasure ensued, so were we left without occupation or ends. Indeed, I found much which brought further light to that path, whereby we saw more that we could do, and by that, further goods we could reach. 
   <br>&emsp;But this soft abandoment of common committments, and our otherwise flourishing through our private governance, brought with it a sort of division regarding possibility. For the good from me has always been enough; and never anything but lacking ourselves and right action, would bend me off that vibrant road. But our place amidst people, time and things while being such way, brought with it a sort of trouble and confusion. For my efforts were such that they could almost naturally procure themselves: I still needed a home though. And by that, our pecuniary efforts saw an expected exchamge between me and other folks. But via our fear of revealing our personal governance, our reservation to be more involved as not to run contrary to such governance --and by that have to explain why--- and our more common and emtional desires (in both love and praise), we errored in finding any broader footing, in both comfort and profession. It was not so much that being ourself was a struggle, or unfufilling, but the basic pressure from being so occupied warranted the deeper feelings that had been covered through our maturing state. But, our efforts to partake in such, and succeed, failed on the count of being as our we were in that governed sense. We never adapted, partook, or spoke in ways that were relevant or effective for the ends our feelings sought. And as those matters failed, we found life restraining, and sought freerer time to be myself. I have learned recently that the means to said feelings is not so challening, or contrary to your goverened self. which is encouraging. But that is merely a remark of our less than free state, continuing to care for the goods of our governance, but with the acquaintences which soothe the emotions which our duties erect. "And our maturing state held to much fear and too little means for relation per our personal state; and so the conditions which sprung our hope for relations and growth remained unchecked, and thus turned us to conditions which were less demanding."
   <br>&emsp;In other words, we learned to be ourself in a resourefull way upon our abscence from the common path. As the concentration for this left, and our natural gait was of that formed complexion, so did we further enrich such state, and simmer our care and judgement for it's goods.

<div id="oldflakes">
   Tradition has lost its stature. The effects of it linger, but so are we merely asked to contend with that as we freely explore.
   <br>&emsp;Such dispositions of the past hold not much more than a sensible view of the world, which rests on both the function of it, and our surrounding oblige. As we ignore the ucstom of the latter, despite being free to beleive what we want regarding the formeer, so do I find much comfort and peace in affirming such things, as it mends our tendancy  to be on our own.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, if I removed the notions tangled on the weeds of mentality, I am left with a fairly deemed concept of the world. Considering the legacy of observation, and the pressures exerted onto the seams of pure reason, I can say that all things seem constant and orderly. By that, our place in the world, orbiting the sun, with plants and man foraging about, so our life lay. By that, I fear no interuption of things, and can remark upon my life as if the things I commonly observe, and know to be present by other's observatoins, are true. I do see the plea for reason, as to rightly know. But our proclivity of thought is one that affords little concern for the concepts and truths born in the past: as such things, despite there fullest attempts, seem to hold their aboslutness in small borders. And my calmet principle, is that iwthi nthe borders that our observations profess, there is neither mcuh which is suggested as our purely reasonable statements would propose; nor, foremost, is there much to concern yourself with outside said borders, which you may suppose. By that notion, I don't deny or refute reason, nor the attempts to bind the modern borders. But there is little merrit I see, in the more animate and customary interprations brought from the past. Namely that they rest on what I can only say is a cesing ambiguity of mentality. 
   <br>&emsp;In that, I can say that our need to affirm, or remark at least baser things, is that our more common actions are so far off, that having a sturdy point from in front and behind, eases our time while doing so.

   I turned my head as my time as a boy was ending; and the direction of my gaze peered inwards, and happily so. Prior to this, my time had been either reckless or somber, and the resolve to mend both seemed out of reach, or uninteresting. As a sort of boiling point occured, I amended to what I was drawn to, and that was myself.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the proclivity for such cares were such, that by the inportance which self-regard brought, I was wholly prepped to converge with such. Upon doing so, I worked myself through efforts and tasks that were a benefit to me personally, be it in prudence or calm delight. 
   <br>&emsp;As the years went on though, our discipline began to settle in, and our need to attend things became less about focus and managment, but rather letting it naturally happen. But as the norms of our gait turned, so were we left with little to attend. We warmly felt the heat of our inner glow, but without the deeds to tend the flame, we felt unoriented. In effect, the common obligations we had began to feel more like burdens than provision. And the result was that the goods which our disposition proccured, felt intruded upon by those civil tasks. Resulting from this was a barron appeal to some route that seperated me from such mundaneness. But this resolve was fruitless, and we were left with nothing else but our self, and the civil norms.
   <br>&emsp;From  this point I realized that our need for things could not be met outside civil affairs. I turned my head towards things which would afford more excess in the things we needed, and more simplicity and fulfullment in the means to them. This part of the path though did not lead to success. As it were, we were well in our intent, and quite able to achieve something. But by our behavior and choices, we did not follow through. And as these aims were subject to our adolescent character, so did our care for romance and friends equally suffer. 
   <br>&emsp;Time then began for me, in that I questioned little of our happiness and its appeal; but the stability which this was propped on held not but a dim light. There was just something about having to provide for the things I cared for, that had me filled with envy and shame. Reasoning that our ends justified the mundane means felt hard to convene with; if only because such reasons were too private, and by that, hard to share. As it happened, we spent our time fiddling and meandering, trying to find acceptance and fortune, as to bear our simple needs a simple furnishment. This did go well, and these years were not short of positive. But the truth, is that nothing but our momentary grace ever came to fruition. And despite having a range of dreamt and firm predictions, so were we merely alof on time's current, never set or ordained for anything beyond. We simply settled and sat at the point we were at, letting our fortuity and felicitiy grown.
   <br>&emsp;Upon this age, where we found ourself, and thereupon the solidity of its frame, so have I struggled to fill that form with any constant amount of living. You see, life is hard to particpate in, as the candor of her sides, albeit bright, hold a draining effect by the surrounding amends to her stirn requirments. I always morned over our need for such affairs, as the cost of them seemed so protuding into our calmer delights. That, and the nature of those delights were such, that all I needed was the meagerest means to sufficiency. But our mature state did not afford us anything more than the admission that we needed satiation. 
   <br>&emsp;From this day where I now live, I have learned and grown, dreamt and reflected; and here and now, in the greenest of places, we have not but a lingering amount of weeds. For our time and ways is not ordained to far off fancies, nor the crushing defeat of our overly stirn regards. We have moulded ourself to care, in a way that remarks the world in all her depth and light; a way that holds me accountable to both her promsie and place, via actions which our common, needed, and affordable. By that, we need not dream of a time when our sweet delights are free for us to tend to; as we do not see this as realistic, nor a misfortune. It is true, that life demands that you breathe, eat and keep warm. Nor does she permitt you to acheive this nasically or happily, without the abilities and slant of man. But our time in the recent year and days, has shown me that our shortcomings have purely come, from our ill treatment of our own portion of that slant, and the fufilling process of being both stable and fed in the whole of life. To much had our aims been garnered on the goods of reason; yet such a manner was not fully stated, in either a mature sense of the world, and our appropraite requirments. As a boy we held no belief in the common end; but to another we did not know, and thus go. We turned to ourself; but it is fair to characterize this as someone finding joy in not; or at least delight outside a path. Truly, the fruits of that became the path itself. But this is not what we feel is offered by reason, nor what we find true in reflection. For the goods our governed way are not so as to be comeplte in themself; but rather as an assortment of scents and flavors that blossom upon our stride living. For no bad day cuold cease enough to prevent our calmest cares being met. And the moral, or lesson rather, is that the goods of reason are merely those which formed on another of life's path; one which holds its candor and hues to all her sides and shades. And from that, our insight is that the steps we take, and to the glimmer on the horizon, is such that of this path which reason exacts, so must we take it as if it were the path were on.
   <br>&emsp;Indeed, the part of our writing which lies like an iceberg under the sea, in part lies in the matter of defintiion. But such elements are merely there as a means of binding against your inefficency. For it is not one in motion who must reflect and treat, but those who fail; as strictly, they have done so if being is no longer bade. For that is what reason is for; to orchestrate what you feel and expect based on your past and place within nature. For however she is, and what we wish she'd be, so are our motions fair and finest, when they can be ordained to be so, as the world accepts. And quite literally, all actions are such, that they warrant reproval, if upon use they elicit the hault of being.  And so, as time can finely exclaim, that tradition, naievety and an otherwise wordly progress, garners a need to iron out the effects of imperfection, to bear clarity in how your proceed imperfectly, and otherwise remark on the goods which make it worthwhile to progress to. For it is all too easy to abide with whats common; as such norms feel laudible by there lasting prescence. But life is always changing, and the standards of now are but the deeper strands which life has not yet woven out. None of us really act in the way that those in the 1800s did. Nor do we see things fundementally as those a millenia ago. But despite admitting the contrast of the former, and the differing norms which our standards now reflect, it is in those of olden days, far back in the faintest history, that still hold a basic thread; one of which our own deepst cares and beliefs reflect. And one which, upon a mere honest observation, can over time be shown to leave nothing but scarrs. But as we don't do what those in recent centuries did, for such manners seem immediate in their antiquation, so is it those deeper threads which take time to iron out. And the fairest way to succeed this, is to

   So the world is more or less a certain way; and of the way it is, so is there a way to be. It is worth noting that a natural view of the world, no matter the colors or proportions, is more or less assumed. If we do not assume it, then it seems better to look past any practical matters. Or, at the very least, if nature was in fact all dual and loopy, ought we define the elements of our oblige in such accords. "For it seems wrong to view things in a certain way, all the while we hold our standards in a different light: the two ought reminsicen one another."
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, of the world and how she is, it is important to note that our view of such is drawn primarily from how she seems; and as such, we deem our amends based on what such view amounts to. Only, this view is mixed between sentiments which are present and lasting. In that, our sense of things may be born from beliefs that have thei heritage upon the beginning of time. Or it may be something that is newly contemporary.
   <br>&emsp;In all of this, I see much importance in simply illustrating the scope of things; and by that, having but a point of view, that perhaps sees both sides, but then merely inclines. For I do not know much; as the deeper nature of things is both a matter itself, and otherwise obscure is its depths reflect. Nor do the definite strands of the world afford much reasoning for which our natural inquiries obsess. But we may rest on the observations we do have. And considering that much of what we believe sits upon surrounding sentiments, so may we remark the points of we which remark some, of the deeper sort maybe, all the while we oblige the specifics which derive from such sides. For instance, if our view of family is born from the roots of civilization, then our current sense may simply spring from that direction. But if we hold more anthropoligical sentiments, then so may our ends seem differnet; considering the possible pitch from points further back. Despite the compaisons being somewhat absent, I simply wish to say that if you are going to consider farther points, and by that simplify more recent ones (which we might have seen as being relativley far back), that our otherwise further regard is not itself a marker of truth, if only because it is further. It is fair to think that the further back you go, the more narrow the points become, as there are either less; or those which are there, are so that they have been precisley seen; for things so far back would not otherwise be deemed, if they in fact were not seen. So past the edge of common concepts, there is a cohesive bend to most observation. If we applied this sentiment though to the remarks of nature herself, then we might say that our descripition of things, for instance the universes simplicity, would be a perspetcive amidst others, each hovering around a shared point; the perspepctives being a variation of concpetion and understanding (theory even) of a piece of evdidence; the nature of which, holds not much more than the doubts of measures and submission. So upon verification, we may simply vary in terms of what we think.
   <br>&emsp;On this note, I would say that our modern permitt to view things naturally, permitts us to consider our efforts via the truth of our personal world; and thereby not the one which governs the whole. In a similar light though, the idea of life, and by that the candor and process of it it's way, is comparable to the borders of our 'natural view' and that of the depths below. In this case, we'd say that on the natural end, wherey observation stacks ontop of that obscure frontier, that so the microbes of Archeon lay. Indeed the border lies between the geology of the Hadeon, and that of microbial fossils in early Archeon. It is prpphecised that polymers, a sort of medley of moleucles which blended, led to the early forms of that which would become microbial. Of this I do not know; and of the relation and resemblence to commonly known cells, I cannot say. But what I would then suspect, and bend to, modern sentiment surely consigns.

<div id="anaturalline">
   So, not to get in some knots, considering the comparitive points I spoke about, but we might benefit from just creating a natural line. 
   <br>&emsp;For one, we're in agreement that our humanity is born from the planet, and it is a self contained system within the nature of things. By that, our being as man is marked by our lineage as apes, and the consquent development from the various stages of man. Despite being characterized by our use of tools, the bulk of these stages can only loosely describe the deeper elemnents which we generally remark as human. Namely, language, memory, imagination, along with the social formations which governance and custom refer. These elements, albeit sourced from an age ago, hold their prominence in the recent three hundred thousand years. Indeed this may be granting too much; as per our notion that the compleixities of man, at least the arrangment that gives such qualities any prevlenance, that so may the primordial forms of these have remained till much later. I am willing though to say, that by 100,000 B.C, that we were more or less governed, similar in manner to current day indigenous tribes. Nor was our language so ape like, but more elaborate; differing perhaps in that it was not so refined; but able still to be particular. And it seems a fair tenant to suggest that the more concrete and definite motions of our mind blossomed in parallel with language.
   <br>&emsp;In terms of family, the root of this holds its baser form millions of years ago. Mammals in general hold some motion which reflects a family; a parental harmony at least. Where the discrete mention of this though comes in, is when our behaviour becomes more clear and deliberative; whereby our engagement with hunting for instance, comes about with communicative forthought and reflection. The conduct and relations which motivate and manage our family is similar to that, as are all kinds of relations: family being a mere portion of that.
   <br>&emsp;But indeed governance comes in, for the purpose of family is accompanied by the efforts which were obliged to greet. In terms of relation, governance is a sort of commisery and custom as to collectivley facilate such ends. And by that, the need for family is mixed with the novel interest one has for it, and so the latter committs amidst the needs of governance.
   <br>&emsp;At this point, we are left with the question of neccessity, as family pertains. And in esscence, there is a side to this which feels essential, namely in the continuation of man. But the origins of these happenings hold a distinct place when compared to our modern times. Namely, in the way that our collective functions, and how the motions of old derive custom. For in that far off way, the concerns of the many was in their collective means for shelter and satiation. And as custom was pillared upon this, in both the agreement of folk to partake, and the aim of authorities to commission, that so would the purpose of family lay; in that, as if an neccessity on the basis of propogation, but seperate in kind from our need for food, that so were each, in their basic kind, consented on collective need for this. This was the soul lens at least.
   <br>&emsp;In modern times though, the proficiency of man, in his stable continutation, sprouted into points of progress, whereby the primary objects of older times (and their governance) could be amended with less concentrated points. The pillars remained, yet less folk were require to hold them up. And by that, more could do as they please: and the custom folded around such freedom. 
   <br>&emsp;We may speak of culture later on, but I would like to mention the advance of our freedoms. For just as the pillar of satiety needed the whole to erect, and the agrarian advents which allowed for success without every hand, that so in the following millenias were other frameworks developed; not only to a point which further stationed the basic pillars ---of both an original and novel time--- but to an end which was full of pillars of a pleasing and kindred sort. Engineeering comes to mind, in that enough hands were free to erect the Pyramids of Gyza; or the mere splatters of tech, in masonry and printing. So upon this did the world birth an economy, and firmer stations of people as remarked it. 
   <br>&emsp;From this though, lies the hearted question, namely of our needs amidst said economy, and the deeds to bide it. Generally, it is hard to say, for the assertion of any sentiment requires an elegant proposal. From where we've come, I'd say were on track to exlaim the present: but such statements are what need to be done, and bringing what we know and what we now see is quite hard to do.

   So consider two populations of people, or governances rather. Each may be a hegemon, or empire; they may be ruled by a king, a minister; and more likely than not, they are seperated into provinces, kingdoms or states; and better put, the arrangment of these amdist one another, be it federally or the empire, remarks there total status.
   <br>&emsp;Now, generally speaking each form compares in the orientation of crown and county. Where they differ is in how sharp the point is, and how broad the base is. In any case, if there is a conflict between both blades, then subjects within the base are called up to fight; be it to blunt the other knife, take some of its base, or merely defend the same interests of the other. As it were, the destruction caused is usually to those involved in the fighting, and those amidst the figthing grounds. Generally speaking, the back lands see little damage, while those on the front receive the most. If there is conquest, then so may the path taken by the victor lead to damage along their route. More often then not though, upon their cease of land or crown, the subjects of the defeated state become members of the conquerer. Their status may not be as it was before; and almost surely their custom and ways will alter. But beyond the loss of those who won and lost, so is the time ahead slanted up. 
   <br>&emsp;In terms of conduct, the horror of conflict lies in the trauma one recieves. There may be fiendishness, strict laws and according severity; or there may just be censors, curfews, obdience and according custom. 
   <br>&emsp;What is important to note though, is that good and bad occurs in the heart and minds of people; as are crimes committed to and from folks. A community though, suffering instance over the loss of a neighbour, is merely a emotion shared by those who held similar relations with the one lost. If only one person knew them, and their feeling was such, a grievence within the community merely marks a broader amount of people who knew. 
   <br>&emsp;In that way, we can define one's actions as particular to them; and along with that, that such actions were defined by the depth of such path, as opposed to generalizing across the norm of more than one. In that way, a solider is made aware of a conflict, goes through recruiting, travles and initates themselves to the operation, trains, is transported, begins their service, as a mechanic, medic, artillery officer or man of the front. And for each, their path is such that, be it a battle in the evening, or a skirmish at noon, that upon its end, and by fortune's gain, breakfast, lunch and dinner lie. Nor does rest avoid them; and if nerves, trauma and fear grind them to a sigh, then so do angst and boredom occur. Only, while they are amidst their post, near or far from the cliff side. And as for battle, let us just say that a man's service and pain is earns him respect, and affords him pride. Nor in injury or violence, is he home to any but himself; and by that, subject to anything but his character, heart, courage, and is candor and hue for action. Not a shots been fired, nor a hit recieved, that was not of one ill-fit for this description. Someone though who took pains to inflict more upon others, or cackled and smiled at other's hurt, such makes a fiend. And indeed, I say all of this, for despite being well spoken of the groups and divisions which partook in such conflicts, it is almost absent of any to really know path of any given man. And from that, as you lean back and adjust to your own humanity, and otherwise step down the tracks of actual men, you realize that what is likely so and common for all men, is not so fiendish, nor anything short of civil; but merely law being executed, and foreigners being spat at. But any hurt delivered to them, is but arsenal being used for the operation, or the severity of penalities which policy exhibits. And none hold but a seldom mark from the pity establishment of modern and stupid men.
   <br>&emsp;At heart, man is but a wandering animal, happy with others as he is with the comfort of food. Indeed, it would seem fair to say that part of the warmth he feels to others, is in the confidence they bring him in his pursuit of goods and things. Such desires are furnished by the support other's offer. But as for the path he's actually come, so is this hard to chart. And less we remark upon things in the most basic of ways, then our ignorance will hault our inquiry. For it is not true that man was so, then governed, then economic, but rather they were men, each with a name, or being, with a nature that had them convene. And from that, by the heaves and hoes from Erectus to congress, so has there been not but a day, where the minutely furthered slice was experienced. Bit by bit the days grow, to the point where a novel piece is fitted. But we are truly part of a massive puzzel; and as to remark the truth, ought one only in time use the biggest pieces. Or, if they do as the world is now, hold little speculation and stateliness, and be but general as the world seems present. Then even, how thick is each piece, regardless of the single layer. For the names of countries do not encapsulate them. Nor do the words and ways of their governent express the conditions of their people. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, the world is always in a moment. But in extent, the pieces in play are but systems of their own. And each of these holds with it a sort of structure and quality, of which one ought not generally suggest, nor the other being summaried and in fairness forgotten. As it were, how things were and how things are, give us insight to how things should be. But predicting the future holds with it a great demand to be thorough in your statement. For if the world is full of strucutures and objects inside them, then the future state of the world will simply remark the arrangement of that. If the present then, and winds of the past, speak to the road ahead, then so ought the complexion of that road, as we'd only care to know, be a scale in which our basis for prediction stands on. "For it is foolish to look up from a world which holds a thin form and empty substance, and expect to likely see a point ahead with otherwise qualities." Furthermore, it would be unnecassrily astute to claim that our predictions should be of the world as it fully is, rather than we thinnly imagine. And if so, then the propiety of our present statements is laid, and the scale for whether or statements are meaningfull at all. For the future is important indeed, but if your proclomations are sprung from a small view, then the end which you see is seemingly worthless.

   The economy, being a result of excess, holds in it a sort of potential; in that by industrial means, folk are not only subject to the riches of the economies state, but able to produce.
   <br>&emsp;For the way an economy works, is that attention can be paid to developing goods and service. Because this requires time and care to faciliate, people  can sell their efforts; and those managing the venture purchase it with a wage. The modern economy though also permitts more and more people to begin ventures; be it in craft or art. For a venture is traditionally one of exchange, in that a resource is manufactured for consumption, labored by those who earn wages to produce, and purchased by those who's seperate income permitts their interest to buy. But the means to this can be translated into ventures which are less of industry, but creation; namely in printing, visual arts, and the modern variations. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the modern state of the economy is such, that people may cultivate an equitable fortune, in that their efforts can be servicable, rather than compensitory. Alongside this, folk may invovle themselves in such ventures, as laboroers fit for this creative venture. This is where the trades of film, media, design and games come in. And indeed, if one initiates a pursuit of film making, and hires those to work, so may those people partake in the ways of such creation, and bolster themselves for future creativity --of an equitable sort. 
   <br>&emsp;By that token, I mark our lingering interest to play and create when it comes to gaming, study and film. And because of this, the craft of video making seems a draw. Moreso, when I look at our life in terms of needs, and the according earnings we seek, so is there a course for investing in our means, namely in that of video/media production. For such lanes hold the side of things which I care for, and the genersous interest I imagine. This seems then like an oppertune path, as it makes use of the creative industries within the economy, and our skills and relations within the field which I'd wish to create. 
   <br>&emsp;In this way the world lies. And per the economy, so are we in but an elabortae form of the orginal system. In that case, there were pillars which had to be held up everyone. Eventually, less were required, and more could attend to other things. From that, new pillars were held up. As time went on, the mode of the system changed to a principal excess, whereby the arrangment around food and shelter was but a baser layer, upon which the relations of commerce and leisure ran. It seems that we are still in it, having changed only in the means by which new pillars (of goods and service) were made. And indeed, the baser governments held some sort of custom over commerce, as to make it fair and equitable: both in labor and exchange. In many ways, the purpose of government was in binding the pillars that the collective held together; and the economy is but a higher layer which people partake in; and like a well which everyone brought water from, so is the governmetns an equal faciliator in the pools of commerce.

   From what I know, there is a both a dream and means to creating things online. Life is not so wholly from doing so, but there is a novel appeal, and practical advantage. 
   <br>&emsp;At any rate, the greatest barrier to entry is in consistency. For if you wish to validate your channel, grow it, and earn from it as you find your stride, then you will have to post. This is why picking a niche and formatt which fits your capacity is essential. Making a podcast could be alright, but I don't think I want to make 50 of them before I make a penny. Shorts on the other hand, particularly on plump platforms like Tik Tok, can be oriented in a lasting bulky way. There's no guarentee though. But it is worth noting that your progress and familiarity will bring you to consistent points of satisfaction, anticipation and humility. "I recall our first videos to hit 600 views, and how good that felt." Our videos weren't terrific though; and if the material was the core element, so was it of something old. 
   <br>&emsp;One of the oddities in all of this, is that none grant you a reward, nor prevent you from gaining. In some sense, the motions of users on a platform are what determines what is subsquently met. Strictly, those who have come hold a clear relation for algorithms to suggest; moreso, are people who have been already noted as being a certain way, and so by a users perceived interests, so are such creators eligble for suggestion. "As they are the sample lot which users are pointed to." That is why niches are important, as you make yourself relevant within a certain direction, for those who, typically have such interest, and are otherwise noted by the alogrithm as having such an interest as (meta-noted) which you are a source for. Make your stamp then, as you warrant yourself the chance to be seen. 
   <br>&emsp;In that way, the core argument is one of platforms. For engagement is not itself the economic issue, but rather of exchange; which econmomics is built on. But there is little doubt or reasoning which requires regard for the profit of exchange, as the basic means can facilaite that. What matters is the engagmenent. This stands on the function of a platform, and thus the persistence of such operation. Facebook for instance, despite being around, functions quite differently than it did before; and thus the proper oblige to its system has changed. Youtube is generally what it's been, and Tik Tok also remains the same. The latter though, for instance, is rewarding longer form videos. Which is but a newer side for creators to lean on. More impprtantly though, is the longevity of Tik Tok as a platform, and whether it will remain present in our country; or at least, if so, whether it will keep to its current function.

   At the foot of society is a sort of collective commissery; namely, towards the purpose of needs and satiety. 
   <br>&emsp;Government, and custom, is that which forms around the strenght of such union, in that upon a stable conidtion of such gains, so is the binding of it admitted. You might imagine this as lonely wanderers, merging together to support the other's travel amidst the grasp for sustenance. But as enough come, or at least some reliability is gained, then like a pillar erected for stability, so around the folks surrounding doth culture and custom lay.
   <br>&emsp;Upon this point, the matters of water are attended. As food being essential, and water being randomly got, so by the settled communion --by virtue of the steadyness of food (that all to moving substance)- that so the steadyness of water lays. In a well perhaps. Better said though, around the essentials which afford a governed communio, that so are a) those essentials maintained and improved, and b) other pillars erected. For man needs more than food, but also shelter, custom, production of tools and other means. And so does a richly simple commune lay.
   <br>&emsp;As time goes on, people notice other things. As if upon the pillar of food, that means for reliable water were gained, that equal to the search and industry for that, were other things found; things which could be added or used for improvement. And by this, the ocncept of buildings came about, along with a novel dispersion of tools and goods. 
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps the space between everyone producing and buying goods, and those being made as mere tokens amidst the simple ways is unclear; for how did any have money or means of exchange for such goods? How could the labor required to extract and manufacture be ordained without compensation? Even if someone were a cobbler, a blacksmith, a watchmaker or cook, who held any means to purcahse them? The spring for economics needs more specifics.
   <br>&emsp;We can say though, in general terms, that amidst the foundational pillars of the group, new ones were laid. These amounted to advents in culture, profession, and the goods and activities that came about. As it were though, this line of development furthered to the point where points of exchange littered the land: a true economy.

<div id="growingaim">
   I have always been happy, and aimed for it. Our life has not been but a required garnish.
   <br>&emsp;The toruble in describing this though, is that there are needs, and beyond your simplicity, so are you without a grip on such things, out of control: for you either freeze, or seep the warth from another.
   <br>&emsp;In that I can say, or at least I could recount, the choices I've made. But right now, all I see, is that even if I were to garner some stability, that happiness would be my sight. For the thing I know, is that such goods are all you do, or ever will seek. For it is what remarks the stride of our moment; and by that, the warmth which your life brings for. This is why, when we are sapped from heat, we dream and amend for such success. But the happiness we see is really one of imagery and pursuit, rather than experience. I would not say the things we anticipate are poor in making us happy; only that their worth is in the happiness ahead, rather than the passion your feeling now. 
   <br>&emsp;This is where I lie then. For much of what I feel makes me happy is not, on inspection, much different than what I can imagine. Foremost, is that the giddy excitement I have of some exocitc end, is not of more worth than the actual end is concerned. And the thing we forget, is much of our pleasure comes from the sight of such experience, rather than what it will actuallly confer. For I too feel myself setting sights on things, feeling elated; and otherwise relishing the fact that of such fancied sights, we can see. And our depression comes when such sights are gone. 
   <br>&emsp;It is all so important though, that what we care for now, is in many ways what the future is promsied on. Only, the character of it changes it's hue, thus drawing our passion towards something so apparently vibrant. But the fact is, that the granduer of that image draws us more now, than it would during the moment. Better put, and my point, that the good from that experience is so on the balance of its elements: but such a balance is not what we imbued with on approach; for in that, the very idea of something is what energizes us, and our view is whats pleasant. That, and the very prescence of a view, affords us a sort of barrier from depression and apprehension.
   <br>&emsp;My point then is one of wisdom. As the good that our view brings, to me, seems not what the present will then be. For you will be there, having to experience things. Indeed there may be a arrangment of work and feed which allows for enjoyment. 
   <br>&emsp;I just don't value much on the promise of things. For I don't feel that the present is lacking those things, but rather a harmony with what is available. I think we forget a) the work required to reach our dream, b) the continued maintence of it, and c) the value of it once it becomes something were apart of, and d) once it's over, we simply dream of more, or settle ourselves in, and be happy as our fortune permitts. And this latter, to me, is not to be averse to. But I think it is essentially on par with what you can currently be.
   <br>&emsp;Our approach in life has been such, that of one, we at one point withdrew. And from there, assimilated to a purely happy being. Here the tits and tats of leisure came to brew, along with the bones of self-regard, and the cheer from our world view, and seeing her grain and hues. It has been like a grove, where the leaves were shining, or paled with blue icy frost. And the sun, always setting, to a moon which comes to rise. Nor the birds mellodies amidst the heat and wind, or the flushings of a squirell. The grass is soft, and there are slopes which give a slant view of the lands and sky. And indeed, though we must treat it, is there shelter, full of satiable and crafy ends. Theres not but peace and prosperity here. Though we do spend a bit to much time in the surrounding forest.
   <br>&emsp;And so now, I feel on the backs of tradition, and otherwise set to relieve this gasp for breathe which comes ever so often. I don't wish to put myself in this place, nor do I want to avoid the drip in our comfort which comes from ordaining another. But I have, in our fortune and dubious ways, founded a mine of calm delight and joy. And our sights ahead, as the sap of comfort compells me, is not to a new mine, but merely an array of motions --be it expanding or stabilizing-- that surround the current spring. It needs but additions, in both the rafters and company. For I don't truly consent, nor admire, the fancied elation to adventure, infamy, posterity, and gain. These are but the prospects of one unfamiliar which the dearer portions of nature. Things of which don't linger in their good upon completion; but instead draw more.
</div>
<div id="calmhope">
   The oddest force in the world is money, as you must work for it. Nor do things worth buying come cheap. And even if you could afford it, there's not much in a single experience, but one whose pleasure extends through your life; and as such, you ought procure money consistently, as to purchase things often.
   <br>&emsp;But the thing I find is that such hopes are built on rickety foundations. Simply, when we are lacking, we dream, and by that, find passion in things which can bring us there. This is from an ungrounded or satisfied customer though. And in effect, wisdom fairly suggests, that upon realizing your hope, that you will simply wish for more. Mainly in part, because of the thing you seek being a mere experience, or some preferred ordinance in your living: the highest being king. 
   <br>&emsp;These do not prolong your experience though from the moments invovled, but only the search, your grasp, your success and achievment. But where does happiness lie if not in the living? Dreams seem but an antidote to a current lack of happiness. The principle though is that what strikes you about your discontent, will not bring you content upon arrival. For the candour of what you seek is that it is opposite of where your currently at; and the contrast brings your gaze to some brighter horizon: the peering of which, marks your passion and claim. But not what actually lies at it's edge: for you must actually do as living requires, and that which offers content. Or you will simply seek more.
   <br>&emsp;This discretion, or prediction rather, is merely here as an admission to our cares within living, and of finance. For if I had all the money in the world, I would go to India, Bengal, China, and perhaps the richer parts of London. But these hopes are but tingling inclinations, buzzing from dreams of the past. Indeed they never come to fruition, as either aims or the according resolves; but their moments do leave a sort of lint, and carry thus their seeking smell. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, I would rather clean these off, then have to humour them as part of our amends. For they remark what I would call 'an idle state'; one of which, fairly by nature's demands, and less so by our fiddling oblige, comes from our sedition to dutiful ware and monotony: whereupon we tiredly dream, 'for who wishes to be so tired and stuck, and set in it'. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, my interests are grounded from self-observation, and the similar dualism to nature's claim; whereby we hold the elements of amends based on our propiety, and those of reward. This is but a root though, a sort of personal bank of pleasure and security. For we are a man, and by that subject to the world. Only, our intent is not to fancy our unbridled inclinations --to Bengal. As mentioend, these are from an instable state; and not likely absent if our personal bank is empty. For we may be nieve in our surface level ways; or we may be puffed up from our youth, or simply with angst in our less than glorious positio. There are an assortment of ways as to why we dream, and proceed either with confidence or angst. Wisdom, though not with disdain, merely remarks what's vain about this.
   <br>&emsp;In many ways, I ought balance our current wares with that which is expected of me. For our civil state is such that little is needed: but some still. And so our abscence of much bears disharmony. Per tradition though, we are not so needing of parlay. For we may wish for chidlren, in a predictable sense; and that of partners and friends, etc. But our distance from these things is like one's seperation from political contribution, or cultural definement. These are the seeds which get blown upon a blossomed spore: and by that, a prominent man. "To much do I see a prevalance of the former, without the traits of the latter. Or, if those traits are prevalant, their to fixated and focused, and lacking of the effortless charm which a lush prominence produces." Family is equal, in that, less you seek meaning, or feel compelled based on reaching now which is eventual, then so are you actually preparing, or on approach to such eventuality, by the natural rise of your prevalcne and character. And as the world heeds your offer, so doth that of one whose hand you take: and to those you tend to. "It is a fine principle to state, that of such attention, ought I have it in both quality and extent."
   <br>&emsp;In all of this then, there lies the things I find dear, and those which we'd describe as part of our life. The former has been spoken of for years, and the reason for our prominence in such regard, is also its own line of reflection. Where our life has struggle though, is in the strucutral side of things. Our invovlements, friends, genuine contirbution. These things have garnished my efforts for an age it seems. And never, beyond the insight of failure, have I succeeded. It is true that our cares and attempts were off tiler; likely because our pivot point was from deep within. Indeed experience has shown me how to be from that base; nor is it without much strenght to try something new. For I can almsot mold what seems uncertain, with similar portions and light as those which I now see. 
   <br>&emsp;Plainly speaking, I wish for some friends. Perhaps they will not share our care for personal reason and reward; but so in our leisure can we compare. Near this is public invovlment, namely that of recreation. In these, we bear the benefit of itinerary, speaking, vulnerability, along with social potential as pertains romance, partners, relationships and friends. Indeed, having a job fixates me and thus draws me to these ends. It is also benefited by doing them. Similarly, finding other means to communicate, be it on forums or specilaized sites, can offer an equal amount of relief and attention, like recreation. As such, these elements orbit eachother, and afford one another harmony;  in that by being there, each is able to accept the requirments for itself, lean in as to exhibit committment and the according stability, along with a sort of pleasure, in that each can happily see the point it provides: and of this, others offer, in that they bolster the ware and tear of those around, and at the very least allow them to make their point, and relish it. Nor is the fact that such point becomes easier and rewarding a lesser remark.
   <br>&emsp;As we said, our fears are not such as tradition would see me; nor are our visions of grandeur and reprieve either prominent or consented. But our life is on track for something. Even if it is more moderate, and not dissproprtiante as our visions concieve. By that, I simply wish to correspond with our Sums. The folks to which I'd share are clear, and equally relevant to the sentiment I'd express; and that which I would express is concrete. Our writing compares, though is less definite. And, in propiety, our interest and contribution are heralded here, as we may simply offer a modern take on the mind, God, death and morality. This indeed is our great painting; one of which our current portraits relate. Our children are similar, in that they are the offspring of our current attentions, be it ourself, a job, a partner, a friend. 
   <br>&emsp;I will submitt that our idea of contribution is warped by a fractured view of the world; notably born from TV and screen time. These things just melt my mind; and even as the years have gone on, and as a source of refutation and validation, our otherwise impressions still leave me irriated by what I see on TV. And as so, our common remark is that when our view of the world is guided by study and experience, so is there not what we gleam from TV. But when we do watch it, our fears and elation are instated; and so our duty and oppertunity consent. In that, all I can say, is this very fact of confusion and display from the televised culuture,  moves me to offer some truth, or deep expression. There is room for this, and indeed I find it fufilling. In the same way as one paints about death as to remark there grasp of it, so is our wish and or incline to be on TV, or express ourselves publlicily, an equal amned, in that we grasp our feeling of the world. But the world does not strike me as needing change; as death does not spurr in you a wish to alter it, but mend to it. I think that a better way of viewing this, is that as death is there, so is the world. And by not expressing ourselves, be it through writing or expression, we get weighed down by it: as some feel in there grief about death. And the side of our world view which is subject to colorfull expression, only unerves our insecure state. "While one's fear of death is not prodded by others expression."  As such, I'd say there an educational offer one could make as to afford the ease from expression, and the fair impression to others. Different to this is the need to express as to remove your irriation: whereby we similarly refuted other's view of death and validated our own. Only, in that case, it being so private, meant the proper course was one which remarked your own.  The world is not so different; in that, of death, despite us dealing with it all, that so is the primary force one which remarks your experience with it: and to that, your reflecting amends. To the world then, ought we proceed positively, as if we are tailoring our own needs. Truly we could iron this sentiment out, but I'd say for the moment, the idea that we'd share as to sturdy ourself, and in by that happily effect others by impressing upon them our pure expression, makes the affair both personally and publicly satisfying.
   <br>&emsp;Last in our remarks are the matters of work and correspondance. As the world draws me to express myself, like the force of death, so am I compelled to submitt what I write; as such words are a summary of my dealings with life, and thus expressing them feels formitative. Whereto I do not know. And Indeed, there seems a difference between the mere message I'd send to a professor or forum; and that which I actually procure, like Descartes and Kant. I don't mean to be a writer though, like Rousseua; or Hume even. Indeed, I might benefit an acquaintence with something similar to forums, but in a more concise format for essays. Still, I wonder if our thoughts are better kept as written, and not constructed as those submissions would need. Per the future, I would format my words as to be readable and seen: and in that declarative. Nor would the clearer ideas of Sums be in need of much more than demonstration. But my doubts of death and God seem but private triflings. And easily so; for the wear upon our life draws these mentions out, but the deepness where they lie, and the ripples which the surface elicits. But our steadyness lets me be pleased with said things dear. As remarks work, so is this simple, yet complicated due to aims. For the matter at hand, we are talking about some sort of profession or skill, and all for the sake of money. Only, as my dear efforts get ruffled by surface tension, so does our care and aim for work get rippled by fear and desire. And, as I sit with a clear head and course for action, so do the lingering threads of those sentiments blurr our otherwise content. "Why are you choosing this I say? You won't earn glory, fame nor the means to travel." When this conflict comes up, the work at hand feels more like a burden then satiation; as we feel drawn to do more, and thus the current post is both limiting, and a cost of effort while we work for something more. And the whole venture feels like a drag. In the sense of expression though, you may seek to create content, or be invovled publicly through forms of media. And by that, per our course, so may our skills and invovlement lie. The question though, is whether we learn a skill to leverage, or amend to a path which affords skills and oppertunity; one being short term, the other long. 
   <br>&emsp;What I want is perhaps the mitigating factor. For working little is enough, and sufficeint for what is near and plenty. But, novelly, or of passion, I may seek travel, be it domestic or far. That, and a more plump and ordinate means for living holds itself some favor. In part though, if I remove the harsher sides of fear and delight, then I am left with what could reasonably be, and fairly beyond; but by means which I cannot see. Seemingly, our buiness is a sure curator of such goods, but in correspondance with it's success: and as such, its exhibition of success as a buiness: by which, as one, we must neccessarily amend. Skills may be otherwise garnished, or novel employments; which may be found through simple oppertunity and positions, or by some eligble offer and training. This seems to benefit only the conduct of our work, not its privilage. For if I did go to Thailand, the Atlantic, so would I need a reliable means; and one which I'd be fine doing. So experience is required to secure a familiar standinbg amidst online labours. As regards craft though, besides creation, there is the old way of education. I see much beneift in having a bachelor, as you can simply write. And earning so can likely be done cheaply and swiftly online: but the three year committment is hard. As it were, diplomas and certificates hold no clear route to income. They may afford potential, but no direct eligibility, and thus privalage. Online training seems fair, though the balance of skill and community seems split; in that for one the means are cheap, the other expensive; but of the former, it is unneccessary to have the format which affords the latter: but so are you left with the abscence of what said latter would provide. It  is not entirely true that to find that community that you'd have to pay; but there is much of it which you do, and the value is merely there for such effect. Moreover, the less direct you are in the community, means that you need to be more impressive to enter it; which requires creation, rather than skill. If you simply have that, then you are left with a wrench and no client, nor means to attract other workers. Balancing this with broader skills, and potential variety in oppertunity, does afford some reason to invest. But perhaps each scenario is unique, and as regards its price and value, ought you merely be open and curious, as to find, consider and see. All the while, noting your interest, in that you could work online, with a team, for creation and the good; and through that, by the means of video, audio, graphics, color and design, along with Javascript, media management, SEO. "The oppertunity will be in a company or team looking to hire, based on skill and specific ability; such as moderate means in Javascript, as to clean a website: a digital clerk of sorts. Or to actually perform a task, such as edit a video, or create some flyer. That, or to work on a team as an editor."

   For many reasons, our interest in success is dampened by our happiness and stress. For we can't really see ahead; or we simply dream. But as for action, we tend to get riled up, as if our state in life is probing us to do something rewarding. In the moment were drawn, and can see how well we'll do, and the objects which our success is born from. 
   <br>&emsp;As I settle though, and our happiness comes to be, and our fears flatten out, then so are we in a less elated state. And our view of success is less defined in it's means and ends. As such, our idea of the things we'd do to succeed, hold less promise or confidence; in part, because our view of the end, and the passion stirred in me, don't draw out the view of the means, as to be broader in its form: and thereby evaluated on the way it is at heart, rather than its near and discrete proportions. 
   <br>&emsp;Where I land then, is that from our experience, this part of the path were on is one that either turns away --settling into the content we have-- or proceeds for elaboration of that happiness; but in that, focuses little on the fertility of the project itself. Rather, it tends to be consented to if the form of it is sufficeint, as to afford our creativity and solid base: but not one which is overly attractive and dazzling: which is to say, 'it need not be as a project would want, if it were meant to yield us success, but simply what our generoisity can work from'. 
   <br>&emsp;Right now I am in that state, where we are too happy to care, but inclined also by the sense of duty ahead, and our worth from doing so; and the desired relief from such duty, and its spurr of richer amends. But such amends are not so enticing when are need for them is meager. What I will say, is that in this current rendition of future regard, we are higher than we were before. And as the wave of interest ebbs from passion to past times, so is the bobbing nature of the latter of a relatively complex sort. Or, in short, what is sufficient for creativity is in fact dazzling. Though, when I look at our work, I am not so dazzled, but merely impresed by the strenght of our elements. But little of its excites me, as even the simplest complexion would in a passioned state. So there is a natural flattens to our confidence. Even then, I still recognize the wholenss of our work, and its fit for broad appeal. Theres no heat to this recognition, but as our wave of content bobbs upward, so is our novel desire enstated. "For what, I do not know, but of the basis, as would serve our ordinary worth, and the bobbing fancy to make it something more, for the further gleams of fame, or the nearer wants of reward, so are in total drawn."
   <br>&emsp;I wonder though what such a venture would be. For the marks of elation are quite easy to make, as all seems good when the future seems so clear and prized. "For we will no matter the route make it." But, even if in our relativley solid contentment, and the more faded view of our work, so am I more inclined to see a reason to do it; and by that reason, form our brand and title. For it would be easy to say 'dailyTips' or 'GreensTavern'. Something quick, impersonal and catchy. Then there is another, where we say something personal, overt and obscure, like 'TheMason', 'GreensBounty' or 'JoyWantWonder'; something which was meaningfull to me, and esteemed as something which only those in the group would know. Somewhere in the middle though, there is the remarks of reason and living, along with the nature of this being a channel, with a form and some guided plea for other's attention: something which demonstrates what one could expect, in both the routineliness of our content --hence DailyTips-- and the material of that --be it misties cooking recipes, or Dons sports talk.

   I write so much, for our choices have to led to vulnerabilites as it pertains to sentiment. 
   <br>&emsp;For our amends in  life have been such, that our path for action has changed direction. And from there, a balance of interest and duty was made. But so  was the former given more prevalance, and often at the begudgement of the latter. But so did we acqueise to it, and find reaosn and worth in it.
   <br>&emsp;But as time went on, we were to keen to leave it; either out of relief, or by some oppertunity to do so. And now, when we have nothing, nor the means to find it, were somewhat stuck.
   <br>&emsp;I would say that snetiment attrats upon you via a restless state; in that those who would deem you as unworthy and need if discontent, merely do so in a pointed way: which gets flared up by your actions.
   <br>&emsp;For perhaps their view is ruffled, and thus they forget the past, and fear the future: and judge you accordingly. But as time goes on, and your response to their treatment is  affible, then despite not filling their wish, so are the senitments cooled, leaving not but practicality.
   <br>&emsp;I don't think I have an understanding, which would afford mere allowance for easy progress. But there is room for me to try, whiff, and merely proceed. For that, we have oppertunities: but they are not final. Nor are there many routes with clear paths to them. But we are not so averse to trying, or seeing them.
   <br>&emsp;One of the great assurances, is that where we mean to go, which is all that matters beyond our current vagrance and communion, that such a place has a variety of means, each surrounding one another, and by that, offering potential changes for the sake of preference. As I see now though, it is hard to image about such potential, when you have nothing for now. The point, is that despite a future with ideals, so do you need somewhere to be, however unideal. And indeed, what would be permissible in that is quite broad, and there are options. But time and direct effort seem the only promsing means. For everything else seems blown into the wind. I can widen our search; but really to things which you can be direct about. Emails are always preferable, as is anything which you can communicate directly. But for now, we only have two walmarts and Superstore, each of which seems likely, if not promising. And per the holiday, we need only tenure our family sentiment, remain open ourselves; but thereby remain upright, live, be.

<div id="merereason">
   So just a few remarks, coming primnarily from a talk on Hume. Namely, that in terms of formal reasoning, ie. logic and math, or better yet propositions, there is not requirment, or fair expectation, that anything within said phrases ought actually exist. You may have three connected points; and it may be demonstrated that the angles are always 180<br>&emsp;. Better yet, considering a set of conditions, you may deduce much from them: but that the objects which we are speaking of, with such conditions, do not neccesarily exist. There may be no triangles; or things with that relation. The propositions are merely formal and or abstract. One may ask how we get the elements to use in the propositions; and in terms of mathematics, the buisness is seperate from other objective matters; in the sense that, of a bachelor, who is so if they are umarried, that so may there not be someone who we'd describe as such. The question though, is despite there being no one who meets that condition, has there never been? And if so, how can we make such a conditional statement, considering that the subject of the statement is supposedly unexistant. Similar to math, whereby we attribute values and relate upon them, that the idea of a bachelor is used upon the value of a person; meaning some generic and or abstract object of that kind; a kind which can be more or less dervied from the experience we have with it. But we might then as easily say, that a person who is 8ft tall will never exist; and we surley haven't seen one, but the reasoning perhaps for the logic does not require that we do. The reasoning may be strong, but in a formal sense, hinges little on whether an actual person has or will be of such condition. In some sense this is the question, for the meaning of a statement tends to come from its place in the world; and thereby it's impact upon us, had we listened to it. But such an amends usually comes when the statements are based in, and spring us to action, via matters of fact. For if a person cannot be a certain height by the impermissibility of nature, then so is this logical reasoning quite obsucre from matters of fact. Both in the form of the proposition, in that the grounds for it are not (we'll say) based on matters of fact, but mere qualities which bear themselves as possible via the physics of being, 'anot not so much what an actual person is'; as well as the real results of the statement, that they'd be more than merely valid, but true, or real rather. 
   <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is wondering why knowledge is of worth? It would seem that my inclinations for it come from similar source which inclines me to more apparnetly deisrable things. Not so much that my taste for sweets sits alongside a similar pallete for insight, but rather, in my remarks at least, as I'd suggest my interest in such common desires, that so would I say that I seek things from knowledge.
   <br>&emsp;But in fact, I do not know what I seek, for the basis for what I would, is not something that really serves me. At least, in a modern sense, what I can not attribute to higher motions, or functionings rather at the surface of nature, that so in those deeper sways --where real knowledge lies-- so is our abscence from it without ware and concern; nor is the prescence of it much consolation. As my fears and deeds tend to come from observation and experience. And much of what I see in myself, combined with the collective insight of the man, brings little care in me for things that knowledge is traditionally sought for. My mind is not some seperate entity, and a mystery at that; nor is death some experience which has any reason to be feared of; rather the notion of soul, and afterlife, are but the ends which death is proposed to be an entry to: and of such ride, I do not think much of the facts which describe it, nor is it one which sallies the natural content I have in death. 
   <br>&emsp;In whole, there are many of us who act with a sort of unity; but also perhaps, with an eventual forward bend, as what you propsed as true, and acted by as if you knew, becomes less taughitble, and the concreteness of your  view gives way to a glaring need for change. "And immaleability feels the weight as it is asked to reposition." As such, there has been a history of denial, formalism, scrutiny, and otherwise complacency when liberty is in fact present. For all I seek is to live in a way, that my labors and delights are tended to. This is almost in line with my peacefull grace while respirating, and uncontrolable gasp when there is no air. That as such, so do I honestly remark about the quality of my experience. And in that, lies what is best described as a sort of liberty, in that I can either act or suggest something which is out of the norm. When I do so though, and feel the heat from standards, so do I a) refute those standards, so I may look forward without being pulled from behind, or b) state my own standards, as to cement myself ahead on the new path we've found, and it's end which were on route to. "You can't simply deny the false beliefs of others, but find one's which are true. And indeed, the orthodoxy of those falisites can interfer with your interest in finding better ones; and like a sickness which would cloud the eagerness and ability of our mind (to wonder and pursue), that so is the removal of friction a similar thing: at  least in this we are dealing with it with the medicine of defiance and rebuke."
   <br>&emsp;In many ways, I see that our life as beings, is best described by conditioning. For things which act in a system, and in fairly complex ways, hold but a mere banking towards certain motions; but in the composition of there being, as oppsed to the fairly straighforward motion of a particle, there lies a medley of particular motions; each pointing as direct as the other, or any finer piece for that matter; but by there orientation into a objective system, so do the composed motions, or unified sum if you will, resemble that of gravitation, whereby the attraction of 2 piepces is merely the same as an indivuidal, but being exerted by two indidivuals. Ie. the effect is in the portions: but where lie together, merely exhibits that portion in a larger way, via union, or rather combination. As for the reason  that things exert what they do, and are in the combinations that we see, it is whole and fair to suspect that, beneath this apparent complexity, there lies a deep abyss of simple homogenity. Even though the truth in the matter is unknown, that so is it a fine principle that, despite this deep comparability, that there is in fact no isotropy; and that it is more likely the matter that, of that deep and rising tide, that the meagerest of differences eventually compounded into the complexiites we see. One might view this as a one mile pole which slightly started to unwind, and near the top, exponentially loosened and strung apart. The illustration though, is one that is better viewed like a tree, in that the rise of comparability reached a point where the differentation merely broadened after a long period of time, and in a hasty manner. I'd fair this concept is not to hard to see, even if my explanation is a little parched.

<div id="awkwardtrunk">
   So I sit here, fine, free, and more or less happy. I contend to the environment around, and our personal position with respect to it. But this is not something for me to run to, but assimilate in terms of something deeper. For if someone tells you to grow up and focus on your life, then lists what such would amount to, regardless of the merrit in those suggestions, ought you still focus on your life. In that, reckon the importance of your life, and if the way you ought live it is unclear, then find out. But if your waiting, then your never going to feel set, or accepted.
   <br>&emsp;In many ways, my dearest consent is to that of a family. I just can't imagine that we won't someday have one. Considering our time a decade ago, I can only imagine where we'll be another from here. And so it being eventual is not some derailing factor the present, or anything seemingly nearer. But there ought be a path. For we may find personal privation and amends fulfilling, but they will not bring you to that final place. And so, for your own sake, and that of what lies ahead, ought we live further and more meaningfully.
   <br>&emsp;Where life lies in a balance of regard, whereby we remark our choices thus far, and the potential which lies ahead; and then the future which we see from a point we'd already describe as happy, wherein the path ahead is not one where we'd now try and succeed, and thus have the promise at hand, but rather a sight to what it all means: as if we'd already won. For it is easy to admitt your mistakes,  or at least recognize where your at, and which choices could afford promise. It is another to see, beyond practical insight, what lies in terms of your life entirely. 
   <br>&emsp;We sit then as one already pleased, and quite content. But when we are sprung to regard the future, by virtue of our instability in the present, I see but the little awkwardness which our choices have earned us so far, and what we could then do to amend. And indeed, the sight of this, however near, still fills me with a sense of grounding, and by that a blend of delight and apprehension. Perhaps, from these feelings, lies the sense of what is beyond, as if to fixate the draw the nearby future has. Only, I'd remark that as our current stability is not as tilted, and we retain the insight of the future, while being as pleased as we were, so are we left with a contented view of the future; and in that, a brodaer regard for it. "It is as if we were asked to solve a problem, and upon doing so, we learned about the nature of said problem and said solutions; but in the process, the issue lost it's effect, and thus laid there as a drifting regard for the time ahead: while we sat and rested. Only, our mind is still sat forward, and our contentment isn't one of stability, but time."
</div>
<div id="trapped">
   Continetal philosophy traps itself in the process of identifying things seemingly external, via internal sense. For their being so unque, or external, adds a sort of property to what we'd otherwise see it to be: for we are internally seeing it, and thus, via the means of such sense, that the absolute view of something is from our internal conception: yet what then are we seeing, if not the non external, yet 'impressed' view?
   <br>&emsp;For me, this affords me a sort of inquiry which I'd described as 'contintla progression'. Simply, we live as though the ontology and being of things is paramoubt, and observation is but a resemblence of something truer:  the actuality of possibility. But, when we ultimately designtae our impressions as seomthing seperate and dsintxinte from what we see, then so are we cutting ourselves off from the knoweldge which inquiry brings. Simply, concern your senses as equal to and on par with the objects you see; and remark on them as interactions within a total system: your impression being a term of that. In that, ought we simply be in the neccessary state of progress and inquiry, as to understand all, when there appears so much mystery and difference, yet, less we are of mind, then all is ultiatmely the same. "And inquriy allows us to remove the blockiness of this paradox"
</div>
<div id="meanstogrow">
   As it were, I have a progressive model. Fundemntally, it believes that all phenomena can be explained by the motions of existence, but describing this is both troublesome and obsucre. 
   <br>&emsp;For one, the basis of such statement needs subjects, or objects rather, to be used as parts of the motion. For we are stuck otherwise in a dialectic, whereby our inability to identify one thing, leads us to remarking upon an entire whole.
   <br>&emsp;And indeed, breaking the barrier of this obscurity surrounds the goal of our inquiry. For if we are left with a proper sense of how things appear distinct, yet act in a unified way, then our proposition will be sound. "The way to think of it is in a sheet of fabric, whereby it is all stitched together, and by that, entirely bound. There may be linens though, or fibres. And the polishing of regard we need, is to not run the latter notion into an infinitely plural/piecemeal notion, nor an entirely whole fabric notion." 
   <br>&emsp;The strong sense I have, is that the fabric is more or less whole, but is able to fold whilst retaining substance. And via its ripples, so do complexities lay. The question though, is why it folds as it does; and not just in general, but particular to each point? At least, the apparent distinctions of things, in terms of either properties or localle, suggests some non-uniformity, or isotropy rather, in the spurr for being. 
   <br>&emsp;No matter, our idea of this is beyond the current remarks in physics. It is true that such regards could better really explain the esscence of waves and thermodynamics, and in that, diffuse even the basest of reasons to explore further. "Indeed my need of consolation is already whithered away." But I can't help but remark that our current views on things, and the clarity we seek, is still apt to linger past the surest contentment with our physical view. For I do not know God, nor death, or mind, nor living. And despite there being little which our explanations cannot afford, so is there still an ambiguity, or disregard, for being on the whole; and by that, there seems little grounds for imploring views that run contrary to how those subjects are traditionally seemed.
   <br>&emsp;By that though, it pays  an arm and leg to understand the process by which said things are viewed. Namley in the form of propositions. Here deduction lies, but not so by conditions, or laws, but rather principle, or neccessity. 
   <br>&emsp;And indeed, the progressive model is one that means to ask questions, and by that, assume less certainty than the proponents of something absolute; all the while we establish boundries, as to at least know, within all fairness, how something is with respect to what we already know. 
   <br>&emsp;And all inquiry is, is in establishing the simplicity of those boundries.
</div>
<div id="firstsight">
   So when we were young, we found little interest or reason to strive; nor was it too pleasing or healthy to smoke and slouch. 
   <br>&emsp;But in our resolve, we left for certain matters whch truly drew our mind. Only, the motivation against the opposite was not clear. For we felt principally off while in college; and our health during couriering was strict. But I recall seeking a better job, and being excited. Perhaps, if memory serves me right, we were sitting in our car, considering whether we wanted the new job, or if we would stop, and more or less priotize ourself, and some effort with Justin. I choose the latter.
   <br>&emsp;And from there our entire life changed. For we stopped worrying about schooling, nor were we fraternizing with destruction. Rather, we focused on ourself, and in a relatively strict and vehement way. 
   <br>&emsp;Doing so felt like a sort of condition, as if we were ordained the constance of attention. I recall telling my parents that I would forever live at home; and by that point, five years ahead seemed like an eternal abyss. And our sentiment was that we were going to reach such end. I remember trying to convince them, by saying we'd watch house, write, read things of the eastern sort. And there wasn't much resistance to what I said. Not very much understanding surely, but no conditions on our intent.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, we sat on the back deck, during the final days of the warm sky. And I recall sitting in a lawn chair, looking up at the blue, and feeling a sort of dried air inside me; but in that, a sort of harmony, unity, a sense of proper living. This moment was not rich in the ways that our later years would be, but the form was comparable. 
   <br>&emsp;It was not till we moved to Coquitlam that I referred to such sentiments, namely the mind and the self --while reading Osho. In that, I became incredibly aware of the portion  of me which exhibited desired, want, and ego; and the other which expressed integrity, strenght, ourself. "Left for the latter, right for the former." 
   <br>&emsp;It was only till the year after that this complexion turned to real things; as if  I had discovered the measure of experience, and only had to appropriate our actions to things as to produce such experiences. In many ways, our life has not left this motion, differing only in the  extent of our observations, and choices subsquently made.
   <br>&emsp;Right now, we are feeling the abscence of things, which would normally ground me, and allow me to be who I uniquley am. As it is hard to converse and say that you are not working, going to school, in a relationship. "Imagine if they knew how much time I put into defining friends, and chilrden: or death."
</div>
<div id="aneasierview">
   It seems the right thing is to properly be. Our definitions though of what this entails holds the line of differnece. For some rest on the laurels of logic, and use concepts and abstractions to weave a perfect harmony. While others refute this, saying that the properties of said concepts are not representative to the world. Those who say otherwise, then refute the emperical basis of such critiques, citing the inability to know anything truly via the senses. 
   <br>&emsp;There is a loose thread though, in that the alterante truth which we can know is deemed to be from our mind, or that which we can truly attest. And in effect, there lies a very blank page of reason;  a sort of pointed medley of principles and doctrines: all void of everyday matter. "But then applied to it, as if it were a scale."
   <br>&emsp;The primary concern in all  of this is that the lineage of this thinking has produced a sort of pessimistic view of anything alteranative. How could there not be some eternal good, some sort of animating spirit which brought things to accord; but also a will within man, as to permitt his rightous  obediance to such good, and thus make him moral: for what else permitts, or brings one forward in and through the concept of eternity. 
   <br>&emsp;The issue though is that the contrast to this sense is not well defined. For beyond the complexion of each side, the former is still endowed with the musts of logic. For it is true, that if there were a good, and a will, that so would the latter be proper upon its alignment with the former. But who says there is anything of the sort? It is true that the conception of nature holds some mystery, and by that, it is concievable that our baser views of her permitt the streams of abstractions to be.  But the plea for there to be so feels unfounded. 
   <br>&emsp;In short, there is the matter of truth, which in the common sense, is undiscovered. But so lies sentiment, or one's reasoning as a motive to produce an end which seems conducive to the proprted view of nature. And I would say that the abstract view of nature has no reason to be so, less we believe that an alternative is poor. But the definition of an alertanative, where there is no logical basis for things, but merely the arrangment of nature thus far, is one that holds room and plenty, through living and death. 
   <br>&emsp;As an appeal to Hume, our wishes are ingrained to the elements of the world, and find their preference in real things. Nor is it fair to suggest that the form of those senses, or linens stained by the world, are not either a) of the world, or b) made as such as to be of a form via a relation with the world. "As in the relative motion of things, bringing mechanics to be via relations, rather than an outside force". 
   <br>&emsp;This is the problem you see. For the aim of heaven does hold a scale of morals and virtue. And from that, a measure of good behaviour. But the sentiment of heaven feels like an idea that is made via our time in existence; at the very least a concept which our struggles in existence procurrs, and nudges us to reckon, or remark. "Equal to our thoughts being compared to someone else talking."
   <br>&emsp;As a sort of progression, we may say, that in critiquing something, and stating something holder more truth, that so will the values established of that falsity be tampered with also. For if it isnot true that there is heaven, nor a lord, then so will our feelings and amends regarding that be deemed falluable. 
   <br>&emsp;My feeling, is that the abrasive response by those who deem such a criticsim as either cruel or unfounded, simply have no regard for what good there'd be in an otherwise truth. Notably, what the reality of death is, and what measure of behaviour ought there be with such truth in mind.
   <br>&emsp;In that, we can color this discoure with some finer complexion.  We are rational; at least we are capable of words and speaking. In that, the confusion of life, its tradtionall remarks, and ours current, lead us to say what we would; in that we remark upon whats been said, and what we think is worth adhering to now. In that, we are left with the mystery of how the world is; namely in the oddity of sensation and matter, considering the very diffuse form of nature.  That may be considered the micro scale question; while the macro scale is concerned with the apparent complexity of things, yet via a rather homogenous basis. Better put, the esscence of matter being solid, holds with it either a quality, or joint remark regarding relations,  namely in the differentation of substance, as not to merely hold what we deem properties of matter -- solidity, motion--- but also the distribution of it,  as the apparent complexity of the world seems to come from. 
   <br>&emsp;The mystery most personal to us is sensation; the defintiion of which would surely eradicate any archaic mention of mind.  Just as the idea of solidity is but an aggregate of something smaller and not so solid, so does sensation lay; in that by the relation of things, so do we have such experience; but the actual experience itself, whereby we are aware of the sensation, and by that privy to its result (pain), that so is our awareness of an equal granularity as the stimuli reception. For instance, light is not but a certain ripple, and it wofts over to us after bouncing off something; and because we see so many of those wofts, there is a composition.  In terms of perception, and its form, it seems right to say, in a non dual sense, that each point of stimuli is received by a particualr appartus: a point if you will. And the hypothesis is that there are as many apparti as there are points of the composition.  Also possible is that the resolutiion of our vision is  perhaps not so granular, but full of larger portions which have there own correspondingly large apparati. "Somewhere in the middle, lies the batchings of discrete stimuli, with batches of discrete apparati, which form a less diffuse image: as if this section of apparati formed this portion of the input. Together, the composition may in fact be full of many large pieces, as we'd deem; while the actually mechanism is in fact more diffuse, but arranged into higher order. As if there were the provinces of an impression which we were aware of, but the actual making of such portions (and thus pieces of the whole) were made from the municipalities. "

   So, the care one has in where they live, is not but a range of practical limits, prosperous wonder, a hint of hope, and a realistic chance of nicer scenery.
   <br>&emsp;At it's core, all is the same, varying only in complexin. And indeed, the brighter side of our efforts is aimed at seeing further sides; or different ones. 
   <br>&emsp;But while we may be resting ourselves, or procurring some meaningfull end, so are we obliged to the lands around; in terms of where we'll walk, what we'll see, the literal crust of our existence.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, most places fair best when they have views of the sky or mountains. Distance being a mere scaling factor to this. For being near a mountain does not offer a lingering breadth to it; nor does being far away hold much notice. The sky is not esteemed based on its height, but rather the scope of your view. So if there are trees in the way, or rises in land or residence, then you may see little, in terms of width and depth. And indeed mountains and the sky blend nicely when the right viewport and distance is held. But both can be appreciated on their own. A mere hill will always offer some sight of the sky. Nor will flatlands offer little near residences, and especially not amidst the more open stretches of land. Mountains tend to be tricky to see; for unless a road is wide or bare of trees, then only in the center lane can you see what lies yonder. There are paths though and rear allies which can afford a direct line of sight. But foremost, is a park mans friend here. As the more open land there is, particularly when there is a height above the tree/house line, then the relative peak of the mountains will stand out. And indeed, open lands may fair these sights with ease, differing only in the flat spot you view from: which is not always as nice. To note, that being higher up in general will give a better view of the sky. For the better parts of the day are the quick moments from sunset to dusk, where the melting yellow mixes with the darkening hues: making a rich and velvety blue. This can be seen better from higher up. Though, distance does benefit one's view of such things, as you can see a the broader scopes of the gradient. But with an untrained eye, or squinting stance, the bulk of the colors may blend together. 
   <br>&emsp;In that, you generally have two aspects to living. One regards walking, the other riding. For the first, you are benefited greatly by a grid system; as your medley of strolls will have more variation in terms of routes, rather than relying simply on changes of direction. Parks are God's proof here, as resting amidst a walk is amongst the best feelings, and of a nourishing sort. "Reading a book in these instances is likely my favority thing." But one need not rely on local livnig to enjoy themselves, or find activity. With the advent of scooters, one may evenly ride to nearby points of interest; be it for a view, a rest, or a mere bound around. Whereas our walks extend to the roads nearby, and on occasion to the edge of the neighbourhood, so can riding take us through town, and far parts of the land at that. Combined with transit, you can go to a whole new world. From that, the everyday things you see and care for, have little gems from intersperced sights; along with occasional gems of far views following travels to esteemed spots. This gives an appreciated volume to our daily movement. "For it can be all to troublesome to either need some marvel, or fetter or not having one; or to unervingly go to one."

<div id="roadsofar">
   So we are of the Green family. And for many years, I have been cushioned by our welcoming of our parents generoisity, and the corresponding positivty which we've incresinlgy shown in such a state; to which they have further accepted me.
   <br>&emsp;But the sentiment as of late is one of stark contrast to this. For the man, Ryan, who is of the family, is not truly himself. What he lacks, or better yet, what he achieve, is one thing. But that he is essentially cultivating the softer sides of his time, and with relative angst, furthering his deeper sides, is not so redeemable or satisfying for me and my parents anymore.
   <br>&emsp;The truth in the matter is complicated. As a comprehensive review will show you a) where we are best to go towards, or what we are to relieve, and b) what I personally seek, am at liberty to care for or be content with, and otherwise seek, and see as neccessary --for which I have till this point learned.  This is generally forgotten when I recieve input from my parents; who, in all  their kindness and loving heart, bear down of the fairness of their point, and construde in a way that lacks compassion or reference to those former elements. It is, plainly, as if they wish for me to be fully be, or at least be as I currently am in an upward trajectory. But they forgo who I have become thus far; nor, of the comforts which I am now part, how they've came to be. And depsite our assumptions and complacence being in part why we are without much handle on things, so is it not from an overreaching abuse of such comforts. Time just came this way; and fairly, I was sent to so; and with a mixture of fairness and naievety, focused on the things pleasant to me, and of a dear neccessity. 
   <br>&emsp;I don't feel like the amends for broader pursuits, and foremost some stability, is ill-founded. But the balance of sentiment ought reflect current treatments, 'as if I needed such relief', and whats good long term, 'which ought hold, from the beginning, our trajectory; and upon establishment, review of our balance, and the profit ahead and or reach for sustainability'.
   <br>&emsp;At this point, a fair admission would provide some clarity. I moved up to Kamloops December of 2022. At that point, I had stabilized in Vancouver, following our families split from Pitt Meadows; and all in all, I was happy. Truly, I had made some bad choices, but there effect was not at that point weighing me down. And depsite the awkward assertions of the summer, we had more or less settled into the flow of work and living. I can't say where things would have gone, or what I would seek or see; especially considering the current state were in, and whether or not that other future would compare. But I can say, depsite not fulfilling this, that I was on route to see the good and ease in work and living. 
   <br>&emsp;But alas, I moved, and for the soul reason my dad was sick. I can account that the sentiment of this quickly died from despair, to a lingering misfortune. By the time the new year came about, our norm of being home settled in, and our day to day living occured. Our stay was in relation to our parents trip in the spring. And beyond that, we had some sense, or feeling of uncertainty, that we'd leave after the summer. By this time our dads health was not much in question, and our own life was fairly free. We wrote, made a book, made a new version of our website. We played God of War, watched the Excorcist, watched Kyle play Elden Ring. And foremost, we developed a sort of humble living; one of which was more than ever, pleased to be as was right for the present, and not but considerate, if not clear, on the nature of the future, and our all to easy oblige: to which we were fine to consent to  and later amend, and by that, live with happiness and ease: for we sought no other direction than how things would come to be.
   <br>&emsp;Past a few incidents, the summer came, and our stay was in question. There was little apprhension on my parent's side, and the thought of me staying was quite welcome. I personally saw little delight in this, as Kamloops felt confined. And as the early months of summer went on, I felt a little stale. Despite going through the motions, I felt content to stay, and transition into the fall. I can't recall when this notion came up, but our parent's planned to go to Europe the following spring; and so our stay seemd to naturally follow. Equally unsure, but the unsigned agreement was that I would stay till July; in part because another trip to visit my grandparents was happening after the return from Europe. These plans admittedly may have solidifed later in the year; but so they became. All the while beforehand, we were simply accepting our stay into the cold months; and I'd say our sense was that we'd leave in the spring. And from there the itineraries developed.
   <br>&emsp;Through the fall we picked up our pace, refurbishing our book, getting to practical state of health, and doing some of our deepest writing till that point. "Beyond light as it were." But in this stage something happened. Our sense of the future and how things would be was tampered with. You see, our idea of work and living was that, in our comfortable estate, we were good and happy to make use of it, and enjoy it in a fair and laudible way. The future would come, and we were not averse or afraid of what it did. And our transition would naturally occur. But, as one would see across the years prior, that we had a habit of siding with whats good and pleasing, for the price of waiting for those future things. And indeed, the simplicity which we had experienced with them thus far, gave me a sort of reasonable excuse to do so. But there wasn't sure fire happiness with respect to our outer regards. For we still dreamt of fame and glory, of changing things. Admittedly, this feeling had begun to flatten out when we left Pitt Meadows, but still in this current day we held the remnants of literary and romantic expextation. And indeed, this was a mark  of our naievety; but better said, a remark as to our choices, and the tone of our character and state as became of them; to which we were not so acquited or in place regarding the manners and means of friends and success. "Our relative success, near the roots of things in years prior, likely led to our complacency in how things were; but for this and that reason, we still held the remnants of dreams, which cloytered our wish for Bronte and Sums to be heralded to me." During Christmas we had a melt down; feeling the inexhaustible wait of being happy all the time, and not subsided by the imagined bond between me and Bronte, the Mason, or Shawn. These things not being there, led to a radical implosion when we weren't by our own means happy. That is the sentiment at  least. And so we felt the need to be so perfect, that the slightest request to not do so felt unerving and drastic. So, at Christmas, when dinner and festivities were lauded without care, so were we averse, and unable to appreciate any of it. And as it were, we cried out that we'd made a mistake. By my counts, the feeling was that we had been living as though things would come for the better;  and such sentiments were cushioning the less than outward nature of our lives. Realistically, there is a moral here that exclaims the unneccssary privation of our excellence. But as I knew, and in some sense as it practically were, that behavior of ours was merely to blind to the future whhich would give room to not be so perfect; and feel fine being only moderatley happy. The progressive point though, is that depsite being so happy, and via our excellent means, that such mode of living required the sort of variety and limberness which any mode would. And our choices had not procurred the support, comfort, relations or care, for what would yield me such. "And our mistake was taking ourselves too serioulsy, and overly relying on our means to make us happy. For in doing so, we turned ourselves away from what would, to the point, be there and heeding to your excellence; and not, as it was known, as a friction or contrast to it. For the choice otherwise, was to be compeltely self sustainable; the price of which was a state of excellence which could only come from day to day action: for neither the truth, nor complacence of others, would accept the end as so. And our cry was such, that we never thought otherwise. But, poorly let it happen."
   <br>&emsp;So as year two came up, we were fairly contemt. Though, our insight at the time was that more invovlement would  produce more ease and regularity in me. And for some part it did. By the spring we were going to church, attending Yoga, showing up for several meet ups online, and life felt good. What I noticed though was that these things were not always desirable to attend; particularly because the nature of them was such, that our truest selve was not known. And rather than going to see friends, it felt like seeing acquaintances or colleugaes. Some new some things about me. But very little of what actually held me through the day I shared. As a result, we stopped going to these things. For the flow of our life was such, that being consistent was key. And it happened that these events felt like things we were waiting for and having to attend. And our actions were such that I just wanted to flow on by. I learned though that these sort of things were accessible to me; and this sense extended to broader means as well. And our future has seemed more pleasing and balanced because of this.
   <br>&emsp;Besides that, we were very productive early in the year, remaking our website, making a bunch of videos online, rewriting our book, and generally maintaining a constant stream of writig; one which has not ceased to this day. Our leisure remained pure, our use of scootering brought much wonder and depth to our days, and the general sentiment around was that we were more than fine, free to be, and on route for a fairer time ahead.
   <br>&emsp;Indeed the summer came. But whereas the prior one felt like a drain, this one held moments which were at worst, moderate. Indeed, our bare appreciation allowed this, but so did scootering get me out of the house; and even out the drawn out days. As my parents came back from trips though, the idea of me leaving was put on hold. They suggested that they would like to travel in the fall, and that I might stay then. I had expressed interest in leaving no later than October 1st. After some time, it was settled that I'd leave December 1st. 
   <br>&emsp;What occured though, is that my parents decided to sell their home in the middle of summer. They had friends who expressed interest in buying the place, and so they made formal agreement. They would sell their home then, and my parents would find a house in Pitt Meadows. The former though never came to par. And still to the day, we have the home we purchased, and the one not yet sold. As it became known, October 26th was the acquisition date. And through the weeks leading up, we loaded up smaller things to be sent down to friends houses. I recall feeling sturdy, yet apprhensive about the whole thing. For it was expressed that, by virtue of senitment, and financial strain, I would have to get a job. I did not care for this, but our choice seemed out of the mattter. Up till this point, we were under the impression that we would recieve means to move once we left our parents. A clear figure of 5000$ was the unsigned agreeement. When I had moved up to Kamloops, I had spent to much money on rent, and accumulated some debt. My parents paid this off for me, kindly; but also gave my sister twice the sum of what they gave me. And the understanding was that I would get the other half when I moved out. This could not occur due to the financial strain of owning two homes. 
   Since we've moved, I have felt a receding amount of contempt regarding our life and scennario. When we did move, there were frequent comments about me getting a job, and indeed I felt compressed between our resitance to doing so, at least in the options available. I leaned in though and attempted to go to Superstore. There was a miscomunnication, and I did not get a job. Till this point, we've spoken to Dev, showed our interest, clarified our ability to work anytime, and hopefully there is some promsie for a new year hire. Similarly, I spoke with Poco and Maple Ridge wal-mart. Each are near equals to Superstore in preference, and, like Superstore, hold oppertunity in the new year. Everything else has been a bust. Despite our initial reservations, we were willing and directed to cleaning, caring, land duties, even conierge. Nothing came through, and all the likely because we sent resumes online. While personal shoppping affords a direct line of contact.
   <br>&emsp;As of now, I feel a bit more part of the family. And despite not seeking a richer end, I still feel a fairer approach to our reasonable destination. Having work would make things at home stable, and thus we'd be happier. But the nature of being at home is that most obligations feel intrusive; especially when it is for the sake of being at home. Compared to our own dependance, being at home feels like an easy comfort. Which, indeed, holds the point of our future remarks: and our parents emphasis on work. At any rate, I am sure we will find some harmony in being here, and more stabily proceed to our final end. It may be otherwise, by virtue of a lack of harmony, or we may recieve that small privalage of being sent there with haste.
   <br>&emsp;Of such end, I see a place I'll be long term. A place whos simple oppertunities can act as promises of relief and improvment. A place who's' very nature directs us to establish our self, and our way. Vancouver seems this land, for it is dense, rough in terrain, yet bold in it's views. And, independance is all I really need; for I feel little long term means or care to direct myself when I'm not.
</div>
<div id="frombelow">
   As it often occurs, I need a moment to sift my thoughts and reflect.
   <br>&emsp;Our family is a little unstable, as I. Harmony is always on offer, but the truth in this is hard to oblige, when the present is so rot with the ultimate effects 'of merely having harmony'.
   <br>&emsp;Our stability is such, that we can see, be it alone or with others, the future in a solid and forward way. Currently, however, we see a discociation from our current spot, regardless of harmony. Indeed, the harmony could itself solidify, and secure our drifting pace, 'but still a drift no less'.
   <br>&emsp;Now, in moments of duress, it is hard not to respond to heavily to the current moment. In calmer moments however, but of a negative sort, you can see clearly what is right to do for the years ahead. 
   <br>&emsp;By that, I see that we are not so fit in regards to health, nor is our moral, relational or creative prowess where it could be; nor is our personal interest as collected as I know it could be. "I'd describe our life as a constant amendment for the latter, while the former aspects whilter away; leaving me with nothing by hopes and apprehension, and thereby a drain our interest." 
   <br>&emsp;Our composure within these slower moments lets me see how things ought be, with respect to orientation for the sake of stability. For one, indepandence feels neccessary, for progess is otherwise exposed to the differing forces of others; nor is it able to be consistent, and by that, further. "It often gets dry and swollen, or otherwise cracked in its base, and wilts and wains."
   <br>&emsp;I will not sit here and say that what is near and present, is not either relevant, likely to be irking our emotions and intent. But, in all fairness, the unease I feel is revealing prior notions; or at least current thoughts tailored to our reason and sense. Indeed, I am all to contained, as not to let our negativivity spurr feelings in that 'progressive sense'; as if I considered moving farther forward, away from our current pich, but due to the dissaray which such pitch has brought, and accordingly omtivated, that there are less than proper objects to be measured through our sense, and future regard. 
</div>
<div id="soonfinal">
   So we have been asked to stay, once again. Despite this, we have also been offered the means to leave, and in a fair state.
   <br>&emsp;I am not sure what to do. What is right holds me towards Vancouver; as it is where I'd like to be, grow and stay. I compare this to atheletics, in that, for all positions, ought you remain limber and spry. But even if you mean to play baseball, and well, so ought to be in line for that, per the aspects (particular) required. In the same sense, that you may merely be un-negative, and by that, ample in your general atheltics, but thereby not fully foster, that so may you, in your specifics, be equally ample, but not full grown.
   <br>&emsp;In that sense, we have never been unathletic per say. But our time doing so has never been easy, as our amends to cushion and or iron out downward trends, has never been understood or accepted, as such intent was aimed at something non-specific. Across the whole of our lives, ought we be specific, sure. But our cultivation does not lack the product of such pursuit, merely the orientation: as if we indeed had a heading at all. For so long we've merely been, and well, but to no end but that which might call me. It is time, or at least reason ultiamtely suggests, that heeding some call, be it with far or mere limber steps, is upon us.
   <br>&emsp;In this way, we have a fair amount of clarity. As the sentiment within me is one that wavers over the quality of our 'general athletics', but not our direct skill. In other words, we are more concerend, theres a feeling at least, that of our mozying ways, ought we do this or that to make such strides preferable. Indeed, there are remarks about this; and if our strides were not at all ruffled, then surely I'd be fine to remain generally well. But I see from time to time the reality of being so general, and the predicament we find ourself which affords us to do so, in fact not being so stable. By that, in the finer moments of this place, we consider the actual truth of the matter, and where we can be that is not merely general, but actual, stated, right, of ends. 
   <br>&emsp;Indeed, our current moment has me accepting a sort of finality, in that, of our time ahead, so are there things which we see our general attitude being unkept for. I do not doubt that we will reach a point that is appropraite for those; but this carries with it the sentiment 'that we will then begin'. Which, again, is not something I am overt to. But in the current moment, when our ease of mozying is troubled, and were asked to otherwise bolster our generality, or a path which is specific, it is hard not to seek the latter. 
</div>

<div id="toJess">
   So I'm sorry your hurt. Moreso, I am sorry for being the one who made you so. 
   <br>&emsp;I understand that you are going through some things. I understand that your not feeling well, and that your life is feeling unstable. And I understand that my privalages are infuriating to see; and I understand that you feel forgotten.
   <br>&emsp;If I could, I'd share that my own health is wairing. For about a year I've noticed 'being old', like I'm whithering a little. I don't know any detail about you, but I imagine that were similar in that our habits and age are wearing us down. And work, parents, yearning for something else, muddies that up.
   <br>&emsp;I would like to say  something though, at least so that you may understand. I am at home, and indeed, for some time, I've done so rent free, with accomodations. 
   <br>&emsp;First, this is the extent of it. I don't smoke, drink, drive, go out, buy things in general. It is a privalage to be at home, and I am not on the side that says that this is the right thing to do. But it is how things happened. And my interests and ways climatize to it well. If I could say this without venom, you could live at home as I do. But by your own interests and ways, it happens not. Ultiamtely, it is better and required to be indepenant. And by your  scrutiny, and by my own reflection, I agree, and am feeling the effects of not doing so. "It's as if I said, 'I'll get in shape some day', but that day either doesn't come, or, if it does, you have to work even harder, because you've lost so much in the mean time." I am indeed feeling the ware of being at home, sleeping next to mom and dad, having no friends, no romance. It is easy to feel good and comfortable when you don't have anything to do. But it is not easy to be happy. "My privalage is really an allowance to be myself. But doing so does not extend very far." Indeed, my care for health and propiety is helmed for that. And I get quite defensive, for I do have little besides myself. And when the means to that get nudged, or spun over, I get defensive and frusterated.
   <br>&emsp;Ultimately Jess, I see that your struggling, and in all fairness, I am not. This is because of privalge sure, but also from the chocies I've made. 
   <br>&emsp;As it's happened, Dad asked me to move up at the end of 2022. I left my job, and all things relating to romance and friends. In retrospect, I was to pleased to leave and return to ease and comfort. That's just how it goes.
   <br>&emsp;Mom and Dad went for their trip in April, and my sense leading into that was that I'd leave at the end of the summer. Summer came, and they asked what I wanted to do; we were in perfect harmony, and the thought I've being there through the holidays didn't overt me; so I decided to stay, and likely leave in the spring. 
   <br>&emsp;Mom and Dad then said their going to Italy and Palm Springs --for two months basically in May and June--- and for a very long time, it was known that I was to stay till July. "It's hard to describe agreeements within a family, but in terms of understanding at least, it was such that Dad asked me to stay till then, and I surely obliged."
   <br>&emsp;When that day came, we had a discussion. I expressed that I wanted to live; specifically, I said that I did not want to spend another winter. Mom and Dad said that they intended to (maybe) go to Hawwii in the fall, and whehtehr or not I coud stay for the sake of the cats. Nothing was signed on the dotted line. My wish was not to move later than October 1st. Septemebr seemed nice. A little while went on, and I said I would stay. Decemebr 1st was explicitly stated. I did not want to get stuck here for the winter, and likely remain till the spring. Shortly after, Mom and Dad got into cahoots with Sharron and Rob. They had scoured for houses, but for some time, the sentiment was that 'our house is not being sold till next year', we'll look then. When we spoke prior about me leaving, there was no move on the table. And, to be clear, in the year prior, I had that credit card debt. Mom and Dad gave me 5000$. My understanding is that they gave you 10. Dad said he would give me the other 5 when I moved out. And, generally, there was a comfrotable feeling (often expressed, more or less) that I would have meand and support to move -whenever that'd be.
   <br>&emsp;Jim and Sharron said they'd buyt the house near the end of July. Their house did not sell though. As this fact became final, Mom and Dad had already bought their house. We packed and moved, and I did so happily; at least, without a scuff and frown. It simply had to be done. 
   <br>&emsp;Now that were back though, I've just been on the end of a pitiable and contempuous snetiment. As if I've been wasting away, 'and it's about time your grew up'. I've felt this odd, because prior to the move, this snetiment was nowhere to be found. "It's as if people were happier, and understood the developments of the past." Yet, having moved, it's as if none of it happened, and I am now merely someone who has not been working and needs to get a life. 
   <br>&emsp;Now, I understand how the privalge I have upsets you, especially when you don't share the load of it. But my feeling is that, if you were not struggling, then your judgements upon would either be a) absent, b) not so scruitable, and c) more accurate. "I feel often (and I do this to), that when I'm upset and looking at others to be upset with, I look for things that confirm my feelings, rather than warranting them to begin."
   <br>&emsp;I am sorry I yelled, I felt very cornered, and unfairly. I never would hurt you, nor did I feel like it. Innane as it sounds, I was merely asserting myself. "How would I be so forecfull and imperative, and not hurt you, had I cared to do so." 
   <br>&emsp;I just hate when feeling pain, when someone elses wrong. But I do make myself exposed to this, because I rely on those who may cause it.
   <br>&emsp;My intent then, is to rightly and fairly, leave.
   </div>
   <div id="OnKids">
   So I can actually think for a moment. 
   <br>&emsp;Foremost, I wish to have kids. Our desire is not palletable, but our aim is in line with our natural expectations. Similar to our agreement with death, so do we see children as likely; and to such presumed end, I am happy, and pleased. As for their rearing, I see simplicity heralding their home and stead, along with a honorable union with the goods and harmony of the world. I see us rearing them to speak well and clearly, to listen, to walk, talk, breathe and run. And from there, for their own application, or our shared steps abroad, so we'll be. I understand the pre-requisite of money, in that a room, a stroller, food and diapers are required. Nor is there a short amount of odd preperations: an emergency, check ups, glasses, dental. But these are either mended by simpler habits; are not so precarious in their acquisition; or can be attended to when and on the day. Moreover, the basis for chidlren is a dutiful one; and in that, our pecuniary needs are oriented to. In that, assuming we have someone who was as interested as I to birth and raise, and thus share the load of attention and means, that so will we, in our correspoding means, have likely measures to bend them further, and by that, address any momentary or forseen requirments. 
   <br>&emsp;With that in mind, I can say that our draw to this is but a formality. As I do not have a spark inside me, nor any emebers which our relations are kindling. All it seems, is that on this path we stand, akin to death. The mode of our life is such, that progress, the abscence of contributing a new member, and our otherwise prior interests, leads me not but to a proprtioned conclusion. Namely, that of our life, in its investment and regard, ought it be, in expectation and according preference, tailored with such points in mind. Our regard is not so heavy though, for such a path is not mighty in its horizon. "For we may then see, with proper deeds and response; nor can we offer but a little preperation; as such matters are by nature, laid out." 
   <br>&emsp;What is right and wrong then is not, in this case, guilded by any sense that we ought have children now, or shortly. There's no civil or customary need for us to do so. And indeed, little of such sentiment is ever pressed upon me. 
   <br>&emsp;Oddly though, I think that our happiness is the lever by which others express themselves: for in that, in cheer and candour, they wish. Yet the irony, is that what said happiness amounts to is not so clear, except what I can only pin point as a basic need to be true to those future points of children and death. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, we tend to recieve suggestions along the lines of that which would furnish me with fortune and friends. Namely, that of a bigger house, and a acceptable social life.
   <br>&emsp;For one, these remarks feel unfiltered or assessed; as no one ever asks you if you are really happy. At least, if they do, there is seldom an agreement on what such happiness means. For even if I am, and then begin to slip, the resorted expression is one of ventures for the sake of things esteemed to make you happy. But our prior happiness, as we politely claimed, is not concluded as being poor in princiuple, but rather futily achieved. 
   </div>
   <div id="DutyHappiness">
   So their are two main elements: duty and happiness. The form of the latter is all that's worth remarking, while the former is guilded by our baser needs, and the mode their acquired.
   <br>&emsp;Surrounding this though is the direction of our lives. For what we need is not so ardently agreed upon. Nor, is the form of happiness heralded in terms of propiety, or even merrit. "Which is to say, that the matter of happiness, be it crumby or pure, may not be deeemd important, or appropriate even: as duty may hold the our deepest care."
   <br>&emsp;In that, it is quite easy to say that our desired form, is one where the good we experience is ocnsistent, merrily met, and of a wholesome sort; as to accomodate such qualities, whilst also being tender, warm and sweet. Nor are we given much more difficulty in saying that our needs are so as would make us secure; that if we had some thing, that we would be full, fed and sure. Moreover, we might say, that our means to such things is done via ourselves or some collective: and that at some extent of the latter is society made, and an according economoy where our particulare actions within the efficiencies of the whole, treats us to a return in which we can apply to such products of the whole. 
   <br>&emsp;None of this is hard to say.
   <br>&emsp;But that we ought fear our dreasm, as if some messenger is suggesting something; be it of fear or oppertunity. Or whether or not our foresight of death is one that speaks of peace and certain finality, or rather shines upon us with some promise; one of which we can see, relish in, and from there anticpate, but also surrender to and oblige, as pertains to esteemed requisites for entry. These things, alongside many others --in both identities and meaning- are not so clear. 
   <br>&emsp;Where I sit then is in a state of private confidence. A state of which, by all things likely, I am not deterred or afraid by what is apt to come. And as such, I may personally be, in the moment happily, and sturdy to the future to come.
   <br>&emsp;But a matter of deep importance remains. One of which characteries the nature of a species, and by that, a feature which nearly all living things share: progeny. 
   <br>&emsp;For these remarks of ours are not merely attributions to mysteries ahead of us, but also matters of the dearest concern; for upon our natural stride, whereby another is birthed upon us, that so in our provision of security and happiness (for them), do these obscurities lay. Our time is admittedly garnished by age and sensibility. And despite our contemporary release from primitive views and superstition, so are we are least sure and bounded by the strenght in our appraoch, to whichever future lays. One's parenting though is not, in general, or in any particularly esteemed way, propitiated by such confidence. For we may raise them to be a strong as us, whereupon they approach the mysteriees of life with equal might and gust. But so are we playing with the roots of another, as opposed to our own secure trunk. For we can already see, think, consider and align. Our child though is relying on us to do much of this for them. And whether it is our action they need, or mere guidance, so mustn't we compare our relation to the world to their own. 
   </div>

   So a mistake was once made. It occured when we choose to leave our post, of which our later reflections would reveal to have been prosperous. But in any case, we left, and moved north to a comfortable home. Indeed cicrumstance was what called us. But our willingness to go was far too keen and excitable than our a call for duty reflected.
   <br>&emsp;In this, I have learned that happiness is not some hidden treause, laid upon broken glass and smolten steel. As Montainge says, 'it lies out in the open, pleased to be treated (and thus beneovlent) by any who would take her hand'. I can't quite say when this remark came to pass, but I do recall thinking that our congruency with the world, or affibility at least, in terms of our 'hand to happiness', was neither unacceptibility, or with much difficulty to manifest. I have learned things, and indeed, our adolscence has lost its youtfull edge. But I mention this only to highlight our naivety and slant of incongruence, with respect to our being happy in a worldy way. For I do submitt that our views on this matter were not so open or admitted in times past; where we were either agasint the common way, leary about our place in it, and at any rate resolved to live outside of it, or merely to the extent required. "I seldom thought, outside of wishes and fancy, that I would freely and fully stride."
   </div>
   <div id="BucketFull">
   So the strides of our life are duly met by circumstance. The weather, for instance, changes the day, which then changes the days ahead of that; which in effect, contributes to the period coming.
   <br>&emsp;Our resolve though is merely to learn, so that when it rains, or time has come with her many demands, we may fruitfully oblige.
   <br>&emsp;In this, I know foremost that our happiness needs rest. From this though, there lies the trouble in ceasing acitivity, for the external motions of your life are leaned on, as is your own liberty to breathe, and be. In many ways, I could describe this mode as one of stability and progress. For my home does come into question; whereby the extent to which I can see, by virtue of our stability, bears upon me a horizon which my rest is not angst to reach. For the alternative is one, whereup you become still, see little, and feel like little is shown ahead: whereby you wish to further yourself. In line with that, is the sentiment of progress. Rest does not exclusivley fall on this notion, as our working stress and occupied place, may also wish for some promise ahead. This is merely an eligibility though, or rather some sense of oppertunity which your natural strides can meet. For I do not neccesarily need that which said promise would bring, rather that our current path, as ordained and still, will naturally reach; be it through a means or the concurent end.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, I fret not over things I wish to have; nor do I even humour them, as I know in principle, and in awareness of the tamber of the desire, that such things are not worth much. By that though, in all things appropriate, I may still try. Not fretlesslessly for grifted success, but rather for things which we have no recourse to not. The point, is that in the case for work, I may ask, as such success would be something were gratefull toward. But we already have much. And my starting point ought to have been, that what we have is not the primary matter, rather our use of things. It is like someone in water who was born to be in such, who seeks for more, of a quality kind let's say; but this is merely an addition, an arrangment or cirucmstnace; for your being is already one and with water. And swimming then is the crucial matter. And indeed, working at superstore would give us a bucket full; nor would walmart fail to give me a pale's worth. But our swimming will only come so far. As we will still be in this relatively small pond, no matter how much more it is filled up. 
   </div>
   <div id="GooodAhead">
   Our truest desire is akin to a meal, whereby the taste of the food was not only relevant, but our company, the lighting, even the breakfast early in the day. All things work this way for me, and as such, our life being swell, is but an aggregrate of all good things blending together to form a delivious hole.
   <br>&emsp;I need only mention each one then, with some relations which would elevate our interest. 
   <br>&emsp;For one, Civ is coming out. And despite our recent flatness, so has our curiosity began to peak; all in part because our consumption of it through the fall had died down. When I see our scenario though, I see the possibility of moving, and the quandery of finding work from that. The game comes out a month from now, so our ability to anticiapate comes in conflcit with our apprhensiosn aod or preperation of our time ahead. This in many ways is the key reason I'd like to stay at home, and rightly. For Diablo is also coming out. Admittedly, prior to anything that would technically happen; but so is the good I see a little capped by not being able to see further.
   <br>&emsp;In that, I can say, that what I seek is stability. I want to imagine ourselves working from home, or training to be in IT, or running a creator buisness. I also wish to find some commradery in our teamates, showing up on a regular basis, feeling that there is somewhere for us to be. This sens of contentment, whether it is in line for future investement or pure content, so would it please me to bear some union between our intent and that of which our parents see. For they do not know that I agree to the potential for chidlren; and that seeing so, I only would care for one; or that I have such concerns for education. That, and my care for travel is not something I attest. For any feeling for it, or excitement, similar to other anticpations which furnish everything else, so do I see these cares for aborad to be but sparks from our seperated self; whereby nothing near or dear is close, nor something fair and hearty further seen. And I wish for them to hear this; nor do I want any pity, suggestion, our doubt as regards any esteem or ability to travel. "I wish not for their rose tainted appeals or support." 
   <br>&emsp;What I want overall is a place where I no longer see, but happily am. I will endure, embrace, steady and raise. But so would I care for somewhere that I saw progress and habitiation as our path, rather than dreams, reservation, justification or conquest, born from a spot of comfort and flow. 
   <br>&emsp;In many ways, the core of our desires is in being able enough to be and set, as to properly engrain and sprout in our reflective way. For only is that the way for truth and measure, moral and ground. We need no other. And indeed, our experiene of this, by the virtue of principle in our temporary states, speaks to me as something which holds the evident promise of growth; but also a contrary brace to our otherwise whims and discontent: of which comes by the nature of that temporary post. "Our principle merely brings the iteration of our place to a close, and makes what comes to be a upper portion of the wave, seemingly all there is: by which I act, reflect and be." Thereupon I grown, learn and beckon, as to choose where I'll further move to. Only, the crux of our adolescent lives, is in living so purely, albeit with a bulge, in that sheltered peak, that so is the lesson worth decidiing from not one which is laid for the gain of such peak,  but the lands beneath us: where right living lies.
   </div>
   <div id="BetterGood">
   So I seek no child. Simply, I am already fine, pleased and happy. Our choices have not faciliated deep stability, nor the comfort and growth which all people seek. But our actions are quite good, and our abscence of bad one's keeps me happy.
   <br>&emsp;Oppertunity wise, I am not inclined to derail and or abate our current happiness. Such a sentiment falls on the dearness to certain things. These things are in need of their own attention, as in the actual moves in a dance, and that of provision, as to smoothly satiate our needs. Taking further steps, be it in investment or employment, have some promise, and eligbility to be equitable to our dearer ways. But I find their worth to be somewhat novel, and based on the future, rather than the present --as we can concieve of as being. And, as such, I find that our resistance to not seeing such horizon is one where we are simply obliged to be more present and clear now: which is not an easy thing to: for you must think, be honest, iron out your divots and holes: and by that token, submitt to their prescence.
   <br>&emsp;In many ways, our unease at merely being happy, comes down to the steadyness by which we consider being so. For such remarks are in practice, beyond us, and at that, of a future which further dreams compare. This is why we write, as we are trying to be honest, and reach out for the light near us, and simply remedy the shortness of warmth: whereby we then color our ends with the dreams were experiencing, near and now, as if we were pleased with our liberty, to be moral and modern.
   </div>
   <div id="NearDear">
   The finest statemet is one, whereby you orient yourself for the sake of near dearness, and nothing more. "Despite communicating what is possible, and potential."
   <br>&emsp;But, due to normal needs, and corresponding amends, so may we rest on approach to such by the actions we know we'll take: ones which we can also remark upon our arrival.
   <br>&emsp;Simply, the matter here is one of negativity, whereby we see a threat, in terms of some arduous, monotonous, chastising load. And by that, a derision and or flattening of our dear goods. 
   <br>&emsp;The rule of our act, is such, that of those burdens, we may lift ourselves above them, molding our grip, attitude and performance. Not only that, but we can let time and community soften trouble's gaze; wherein you recieve another's hand, or trim the actual weight of the burden. Beyond that, you may increase your interest in such activity by furthering the worth of it; whereby you understand the neccessity in it, and of this count, solidify the aim of your life. Moreover, you may simply see what it offers in terms of good, bread and freedom. Nor can you run out of suitable comparisons or advice, 'wherein we see how our scenario is favorable to others, nor lacking reason and ends which our mentors ascribe.' At any rate, you may actually benefit from these means, be it in baser elements, or those of color and spring. And of the groove which sprouts amidst this centered stone, so may the land rise, by which you see the horizon.
   </div>
   <div id="HollowDuty">
   So we have our duty coming. All in all, if I were King, proposed, and with expressive fortune, than the manner of such oblige would not thwart me. And even if it was deemed to be somewhat negativie, so would the reason for it bear me against.
   <br>&emsp;But, as it were, it feels like were doing this for an unknown reason. Despite this feeling arbitrary and contrived, I can see that there is an ultiamte principle.
   <br>&emsp;Yet, said course of action holds with it very little animation to such principle. All it really amounts to is our progeny, our leadership and or expression. I cannot see where these things lie though. As, our insight is such, that of our common course, where the paces are liberal and rich, so do we naturally proceed, and by thave, have a sort brim cheer as we approach whatever's ahead. Only, when duty comes, or friction at that, we tend to loose our sight, and beckon to the obscurity by which we are either a) obliged for such principle, or b) destined for such, for which said principle is attested to, and our duty a stable means for so. 
   <br>&emsp;Bringing this all in, we have our happiness, and of an abundant sort. And from this, is where I see. Though, all the likely born from the still present deeds upon us; only, by the times and our sensibility, we simply had more room and means to be so inclined. Yet, the limits of that, and pressures, still brought me to be so principally inclined. 
   </div>
   <div id="Blurred">
   So dreams come because we are undoutdedely stressed. Nature is ever upon us. I don't see this as some seperation, as if wind upon rock was a dual matter. But I do see, that, by the whims of the whole, or however you'd state it, that so must we attend to our basic deed: breathe, eat, sleep, rest, survive. These all come about because we are inbued with pleasure and pain. Across the range of these, we tend to predict and anticiapate for the sake of. 
   <br>&emsp;As children we are not less filled with obligations than those of us older. The form is different, but we are still equally in the domain.
   <br>&emsp;I say this, for one may think, in privalage or congruency, that they may be absent of such conditions, and by that, free to experience all that they seek. There is merrit to this, but the sentiment needs a stronger statement.
   <br>&emsp;Simply, as we grasp for breathe, so do we perk up at the sun's shine. This is akin to our awareness of threats, or ease upon a coming relief. Happiness is merely this forrayed into an positive abundance. Whereby, those things which spark our less than begrieved minds, are seen, sought and attended to. "I can say that our past has dealt us a rich hand in these regards. But so do I sulk a little at this state of mind being disturbed. Besides the lapse of such goods, the blurr of our sight of them is what brings me down the most."
   </div>
   <div id="CleaningUp">
   One of the realities of living with other people, is that they are going to do things which are either a) annoying, or b) contemptible. Partciualarly, with family, this sense will be magnififed, as such things will feel worse coming from you, nor so easily communicated. "Things thus harbour."
   <br>&emsp;But the relaity is that our discontent with such matters, no matter the degree, come from an unsteadyness in ourself. Namely, that we have no real grasp on things, and are thus unerved by things which press upon us; as we have no natural press, nor sturdy grounds for bracing.
   <br>&emsp;I'll say then, that our life is such, that of a sort of flow, we are going into one of stability. It cannot be overlooked that this state will include work and self-provision. But it is also so different from every other moment of our life. The main difference being, that our conditions were self imposed, via our interests and creativity, and the normal arrangment with your family, and the encumbent, and generally seen, foresight of our future success and oblige. Our current moment is merely brining things to light, so that our stability is born from us, and thus held by our amends. Nor, compared to the scorn and weariness of dependance, we may rightly and fully address our life and ways. This is no poor matter, and as so, we may clearly attend.
   <br>&emsp;For starters, we are always conditioned. And our sense that something is wrong, stems from the fact that our place in such condition is either unappreciated, or immature. As all, in slavery  or kingship, naturally instatiate themselves to their position; whereby the trouble of it becomes adapted to, as do their strenghts rise over the weight of the request; nor do the rewards stay flat, as your mere prescence tends to bring more reward, if not familiarity and the according satisfaction. Nor, in the things beyond this post, where our postive concerns are drawn, are we so blinded and or hampered to such sights, and by that, witheld to attend. "And there lies hope, to which this calm sea, in all its tides and ripples, elevates the basic level."
   <br>&emsp;In this way, I am grappling with the objects which my unadorned mind seeks; and whether such things ought guide me, and thus become our ends in sight. For such matters, in all the prescence, tend to linger infront us when we have stopped; but our sight of them prior was one that was at that point ahead; as in our fuller strides, we naturally saw the road ahead, and where our heart was taking us. Indeed, these moments held objects of mere sentiment, in that a future of sacrifice and contribution were gleemed. Only, now as our ordinary way has halted, or at least settled, into moments of indolence or rest, so are we without a clear horizon: in decleration or senitment. 
   <br>&emsp;My feeling remains though, that the latter notion is one that marks the proper form of things. For our remarks of the former bring with them a sort of grasping breathe, as the nature of our indolence suggests. And so I heed these not, for the objects deemed are so, and in that esteemed, 'by our halted state'. And the according feeling that we ought, and pleasingly so, amend, is not so fair or valid, in that such ends are concieved and validated by our own lacking: rather than a relation born from solid grounds, and thus clear sight. "Were reaching in one, and merely open to the other. As if we are trying to come back to the world, whereby we strike a thin line; to which entry point holds the only insight to the world we see. While our other way, sees us already near and dear to the world, in all her grace and entirety. And happily, we see ourselves striding towards cleaning up."
   </div>
   <div id="ImrpvoedPath">
   I am a little to idle to say much more than the purest remark. Which is, I have no desire for children. Nor do I recognize much interest in me, besides a sentiment of dreams and or conjuration (as to anticapte). I will admitt that during I finer strides, which are not so constant as to be solid until a discrete change, that within the dips and tides of such finer periods (we'll say), so do I recognize there a heartier view of such ends. In all fairness, this sentiment only occurs as a sort of validation, and or assurance as to something ahead. The difference being in times of more hollow moments during our better days, and the wholer future I see, and what I see during our truly idle times: whereby all but the suns light gleams so harsh upon me, that regards for a child are the next best thing to planning on reaching the moon.
   <br>&emsp;In any case, my solice here is one that permitts recogniton of that natural course. But it is not a course which I am thrilled to be on, or at any rate, meet. And although these recent days have shown me the fair exepectaion of such ends, and the good in sturdying our course for such, I still see that most of what I seek is not so ingrained to such acceptence, but rather the motions of art and leisure, and by that, the according dreams and futility. 
   <br>&emsp;Indeed, as those latter swellings have whithered off, so have we felt a little bare in our purities. Which is to say, that amidst our purities, in their whole and hearty ways, there lies a man content with such, and by that, without much care or contention around him. Time has shown her way though, and brought me to a understandble rebuke, in that, for ends I seek -and the according fancy- or those which have some regard for what is likely, and if not tradiotnally (and as much common), that so ought I be better in my amends; for so much of our time is spent living privately, or at least enclosed. And for some time this served our aim of improvment. But as those years have worn off, and we are now at most remembering the good in being as we improved, so am I left with the honest remark that our inconstancy is born, by choices that have made us ill-equiped or fit for such being. 
   <br>&emsp;My point overall comes from this, in that, of children, or contribution, so do these lay as laudible points of that improved path. But as things, and our view of them, so are they gleamed from the stance of such being. And such a stance, in all honesty, sees with it a need to settle into our rich and gradual path. One of which, in all fairness, sees where we are lacking in terms of those natural ends. For however likely, we may have little sense or idea about how to approach them. That we'd reach them, and strive for them at that, is not something which needs change. But for such important deeds, as would become of such ends, so doth our potential occurence with them reveal the quality of our view and understanding of them. 
   </div>
   <div id="Obsinate">
   For most my life I've been obsinate. The only time I was ever free was when I was running around, playing with my friends.
   <br>&emsp;I never knew many girls, and seldom would they run with us. 
   <br>&emsp;Our life was never an issue this way, as we were solid, tough, strong. Indeed, we often got into trouble. But we learned.
   <br>&emsp;What I can remember though, is that upon our youthful age, life became somewhat tilted, setting onto a point which was not so much about satisfaction and joy, but comfort and fun. We were no longer running around, seeking the mere prescence of friends. But rather hanging out, and at that, appearing places. I never liked this. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, our shift into youth saw us ingratitated to such a flow of life. But in all fairness, it was still of an age where all the tits and tats were done at school. Indeed, we would stay around after, and there were the inklings of hanging out later than that. But for the most part, not much had changed. When we shifted to fully into youth though, it was clear that we were in line with such matters in their fullest expression. 
   <br>&emsp;In all honesty, the conduct of these ways was not so heavily attuned as my remarks may suggest. For the flair of things which I cared little for was centered around school, and not so much afterwards. That is, during recess for instance, there were kids who played soccer, or on the field at least, and those who stood near the school, in a huddle, full of girls and boys, puffing themselves up, chatting, rumouring around. I was so opposed to this. In comparison to the similar scenario the time prior, I was naturally at the heart of it. While in this circumstance --having switched schools-- we were near the outer ring. And sitting there, appearing present, was just stupidly off.
   <br>&emsp;For whatever reason, my entire youth was spent orbiting this arrangment. Only, my care for it was critical, and full of timid scrutiny. The idea of being so prevalent was something which had me blush, or at least shy away from. "And like someone young and in love, but embarrassed by it, 'I equally said such things were stupid'." 
   <br>&emsp;In this way I isolated myself. For I did not change our path, and find other places to be, or people to be around. Or at any rate, as I have become in my current life, I did not finely amend to myself, and cultivate that. Which is to say, that in all the stupidity I saw around, I did not foster myself in our place outside of it, as to be a better version of myself in such place.
   <br>&emsp;I must remark though, that despite our aversion to group sentiment and mentality, I did have great friends. I recalll one who I had never met prior to beginning our highschool year, and he and I shared all our classes, and time together. And beyond that, whether I naturally settled in with my classmates, I always had a good friend or two. And surely one of them was the best, and one who I spent much of my time outside of school with. For some reason the interests we had at that age, playing games, eating food and staying up late, was not something I sought to share with a bundle of people. Especially when I was older, but so in general, this sort of experience felt diluted; either in the enjoyment I would get, as expressing myself felt so crowded out; or, the intent I had, or care for the things at hand, lost their focus and attention. And overall, I just never enjoyed 'hanging out', in that we'd just bro around, through jabs at eachother and what not. I always preferred the actual activity, be it soccer, a hike, a game, or a film. And for my whole life I have either gone where I could do so to a solitary degree, or with a small amount of folk, or mere friend, who would share said activitiy with me.
   <br>&emsp;In many ways, my life has been such, that circumstance has taken me away from what I know, and thus offered me only the easier task of mingling with groups of people; and not so much the longer task of making a dearer friend. Indeed, moving to Pitt Meadows did this; for depsite making good friends, our choice of highschool was detterred by our sentiment regarding the people I'd see myself going with. For that, I went somewhere other. And indeed, highschool felt even more pitched in its group mentality; beyond the little nooks of closer friends that is. But for whatever reason, our life was such, that of our view and course in life, so was it not inclined or appropriate to the norms around; and all the likely because the dreams and assurance we had, was built on finer cares and principles, rather than those of young flirty men. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, our natural path was so, that based on the prolonged stay at school, we naturally incorporated ourselves into more people; and at that, invited interests by others. Early in our years, this process highlighted our immaturity and ways. For in grade 9, two girls showed interest in me, one doing so with near explicity. And I shrugged it off, feeling either nervous, embarrassed, or afraid. Simply, my 'shy' critique of things, in the depths of me we'll say, manifested in this rerpoach from my parents: regarding girls in particular. And so despite feeling fine to be invovled with someone at school, I just felt so averse to their invovlement; so much so, that in that explicit case, I said no. "I reckon, that as I saw much of the puffiness and confidence of people around, that so was our contrast to that something which I felt my parent's exasterbated." For one the key marks, is that our aversion to getting invovled with someone was that it would bring us into the sight of others. In this case, the girl was of a prominent sort. And so my sentiment was that if we got invovled, I would either a) become situated in the tits and tats of all her friends, or b) feel strange and awkward at holding myself back, 'while she otherwise explains my oddities to them: making exucese for my lack of incorporation'.
   <br>&emsp;In any case, this pace of life was brought to our crucial defeat. For life had whithered my down a little, in its wants and needs from me. So much so, that depsite our consistent lameness, we filled out a little, becoming more confident and 'socially tuned'. Yet, despite becoming naturally invovled with other people, I still did not have the bones to back it up. We found ourselves in a rich scenario, and a disagreement arose; we mispoke, and became seperated from the group. Directly and not, our closer relations, 'of those we sat nearest at the group table', left my side also --out of vehemence or happen chance. And I was left all alone, mad, depressed; but also obstinate, and in such a way that I appointed myself to greater actions and success. "A sort of 'screw you' attiude; of such a fuel at least, whereby we were desperately motivated to do well."
   </div>
   <div id="EarthBound">
   So we've mentioend alpha 9 before, it being a colony out in the vastness of the Perseus. The planet is small, and without much vegetation. There is water, and by that, condensation; so that it rains, and snows. The tectonic activity has created mountains in the north, and great deserts in the south. Notably, they have massive purple hued crystals sticking out of them. 
   <br>&emsp;One of the reasons that the northwest was chosen, particularly in the gratient flat, is that aestheically and suitbaly, the place delights. In the north, runs a belt of mountains; pearing out into the western sea, too the easter edge, where mount cushing lies. "And beyond that, there appears flat lands and litte islands dotting the eastern sea." The flat runs down from these mountains, and runs many miles south. Whereby the land begins to dip, 'to which the in the distance the crystal desert lies'. 
   <br>&emsp;As it were, the expidtion was banked on the richness of its inhabitants lives. Notably, so that they may stability and happily flourish, 'whereby their minds may be drawn and nourished, and prompted with a sense worth blinking back to earth'.
   <br>&emsp;That being so, the gratient flat was such, that room was held for several hundred people. Hoom was built with state of the art technology, namely a reproductive line of machinery, whereby offspring could be produced. "Indeed the matter of children reamins an unclear matter." At any rate, the aim of the colony was to live well, and from there, have the lasting means to naturally and or unaturally persist; but all the likely exist initially in the greatest way. 
   <br>&emsp;As such, the flat was choosen because of its relation to the mountains, the western sea and its beach, the relative height compared to lower flats in the east, and that in the south. Simply, it was an unremarkably flat area of land, near the ocean, with views of the mountains, and enough space to warrant such delights. One of the initial initiaivtes was to cultivate the land. Namely, in that via the prescence of water, and the resource machinery on Hoom, the 'soil' naturally found in the ground, could be made harvestable. "Indeed, much of the settlements layout, as remarks beatuy, service and production, has been written in the policies bound."
   <br>&emsp;The heart of this story though, is that earth, in her mid century flair, is a little riged. Indeed, her modern style has grown out of the antiquate ways of the century prior. But still, she beckons to the past, in all the cracks and scarss which the annals have dealt. Her remarks are not seen as detrimental though, as in past expressions. Rather, she is merely stable, yet in a wobbly way. She still lacks a purpose, an aim, some sense of how she'll forever be. Her subjects are of a fair sort, in that the barbarity and pundancy they embellished has but a lingering claim. But of those nearly modern, or variedly natural, so are they few and far between. Admittedly, all have the bones of this, and are not such of the characters millenai prior. But of something defined and elegant, so in the richness of peace and happiness, they are not. "They are but a bit more humble, a bit less clad, nor bigoted. Nor are they as mundane in their freedoms, nor indulgrent. There just lacks something comparable to that which those primtiavely espused; a certainty, some principle, a soldity of living which is both felicituous and moral." And of those on alpha 9, alike those sent further about, so are they all set to enliven such ends, 'and beam back something which worthy of earth's bound'.
   </div>
   <div id="Comissioned">
   So I don't mean to degrade those I'm speaking for. For truly, my dissent of them is more a remark of my ill-fit for such ways; and of ways which are a mirror to certain virtues. "Being so shy, and proclaiming thing's I'm nervous about to be stupid, is no good remark of me."
   <br>&emsp;But I will say, that for all it's worth, I have never ceased this commision to the good, and, through our youth, an aversion to all things I esteemed not as so. Indeed I took this overboard; at least my weakness' became backers to my judgement. But still, I maintain that the crux of those ways, in group interest and broader tradition, is not becoming of what I seek, or of what I find comparable to the experiences I find dear. "It is so, that our weakness', however present, were not so by pure foundation, but application: and our resolve was no pitched to be so prominent, due to the feeble ends I saw."
   <br>&emsp;My aim here is not to critique. My adolescent has held nothing but that. Instead, I would simply remark that of this way, be it with merrit or some sourced preference, that our commisery with it was so, that when we were stout and sound in it (those group and tradiotional ways), that I was fine, excellent in fact, and quite proper in our strides. But as life goes on, and our truer weakness and immatruity come to sway, we loose such prominence, and erode to the outer edges. "Where were simply looking in." It is from here that my life has been formed. For indeed, family trauma has bent me, nor had my actions been rich in sense or solidity; and as such, we were naturally unkept or settled as to be so prominent in those taughty ways. 
   <br>&emsp;Worth noting though, is that in all that time, and particularly as we were forced to grow up, there was never an ambition or sought return to such center. In it's entirety, this statement is not true, as there were motions that reflected such strides. But the intent was generally ill-founded. And an further sentiments of the sort were more akin to dreams and relief. "Whereby we had in fact become ourselves, and happily; but upon life's struggles and our trouble in being so, so did we conjure a destiny which remarked our greater selves, but to a glorious and generous degree."

   So to return to our story, we had broken off with some friends, eventually found new ones, and bad habits at that. And as highschool came to a close, were seeped in the boutinless pit of romance and purpose; and our poor habits had more fuel, as well were our parents displeased.
   <br>&emsp;We reconciled this though and found a point of entry. We went to school in the following winter semester, to much acclaim and excitmenet. Only, I recall surely, that upon the mid-term exams, we were left feeling a little hollow and empty. Perhaps our poor efforts were not so rewarding, and thus our engagmenet was as solid as our effort was. But simply, without the novel motive of continuing to do well, the lack of purpose otherwise left me somewhat directionless and unconcerned about our school. The problem though, was that we were enrolled, and quite destined to find some place in life via this  path. But of that I saw not. 
   <br>&emsp;It was as if I gave way to my reserved and reckless self, but upon entering a better realm, saw no end in it,  nor held any lasting enjoyment due to the applied nature of it. I firmly recall loving the initial half of the semester, as the lectures and post-secondary vibe just felt fun and meaningfull. But the second succcess was on the line, my immaturity and empty sight held me in dismay.
   <br>&emsp;In the year prior some habits had pitched me into a rugged hell. And during that time I had expeirenced a weird hypocondria, where I thought I was dying. "Really just a mixture of destiny and dreams, and that of lonely bareness: by which my heart faintly whimpered." In this later stretch of the semester though, I began to consider suicide. Not literally, in that I sought out a means to it. Rather, as I reckon all would compare, that there was merely a hope for death, 'or rather a cease of our current spot'. I rememeber going to sleep one night, wishing I wouldn't wake up. That was the nature of our intent. Not so much that we would, but that our care to live was gone, and if we were here no longer, how good that'd be.
   <br>&emsp;Things did even out though, as final exams occured, followed by a visit to the states. Our sentiments going in, and upon return, are not so clear, but I can say, as regards my habit, that I had become a little romantic  about ceasing it, claiming 'todays the day, I quit'. And I recall proclaiming that right before I went on the trip; whereby I applied an almighty practice of binging on the soon to be rot substance, 'as if I would fill up my register, and satiate myself enough so that I could persist withotu doing it, indefinitely'. This worked as well as you'd imainge. For upon re-entry, I spent more time acting as I cared not to. And as the summer approach, I was sitting at my friends, in the monring in his backyard, and simply stated I was done. The whole time prior I had been exposed to such habits via certain friends. And in this time, those relations had become more distant; and thus my current plea was one that held not but me to say it. And my friend beside me was equally enamered, and pointed equally.
   <br>&emsp;I wont speak for him, but for me, I had pulled myself out of the hollow hole that my highschool finale had set me in. There was nothing solid I'd reached, but remaining from our attempted efforts was an esteem towards myself. I would have to reflect to really understand the specifics; but I can say, that this initial sense that I had to prove myself was gone; nor was there this lack of what I enjoyed, or cared about in life, to make me feel like efforts of the prior sort were needed. "I no longer felt I was in a hole. Merely standing at the edge of a meadow." For whichever reason, I pointed my efforts for the sake of that, of what I can only describe as my interests and propiety. Simply doing what seemed good in itself, and had me 'being' better, rather than progressing towards some end. 
   <br>&emsp;On that day I quit, me and my friend went into his home. Similar to the bravado I had when quiting prior, 'when I had the flair and confidence that one similary has on new years, when they so hopefully resolve to change', that so was I equally elated and bent towards actions of an esteemed sort. Simply, we went on our computer and searched, 'ten healthiest foods'. Up came an article, showing Kale to have 1,000% vitamin K, mussels to have 10,000% B12, and a few more of the sort. Something struck us about this, and initated a sentiment that has remained prevalent ever since. Being so inspired, we grabbed a bunch of flax, bananas and kale, and smoothie'd it up. Upon drinking it, we felt a little off about the flavor: but so did the point in our life changed. For despite the taste being a little rustic (and in retrospect, lacking of berries), we felt there was this strenght and assurance which camce from the quality of the food. We stood by it, reverred the good in it, and felt, akin to exercise, or that even of the esteemed career one should disipline themselves towards, that this item of ours was of pure worth, no matter the taste. "I might summarize this that we became ideal and disposed into taking our vitamins. And in that, became quite literate in the ways such things were espoused to benefit us. That they did is it's own matter. But of our efforts, we could at least prosper from our belief in them, and all the harmony which surrounded that."
